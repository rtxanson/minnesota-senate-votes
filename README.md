Misc notes:

 * Trying session 2009 - 2010 first, expecting future sessions to have the same
   format, but just in case, naming the parser separately.
 
 * Some issues with chunking out individual votes, will need to make that bit more
   detailed

 * Use xpdf pdftotext to convert the PDFs: `pdftotext -layout filename`

Things to do:

 * Once vote parsing works out, include districts
