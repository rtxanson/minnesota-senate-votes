was found not identical with companion Senate File as follows:
     GENERAL ORDERS                    CONSENT CALENDAR                         CALENDAR

File be indefinitely postponed.

declaring the forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes must be classified by the county board of the
county in which the parcels lie as conservation or nonconservation. In making the classification the
board shall consider the present use of adjacent lands, the productivity of the soil, the character of
forest or other growth, accessibility of lands to established roads, schools, and other public services,
their peculiar suitability or desirability for particular uses, and the suitability of the forest resources
on the land for multiple use,         ­and sustained yield management. The classification, furthermore, must
encourage and foster a mode of land utilization that will facilitate the economical and adequate
provision of transportation, roads, water supply, drainage, sanitation, education, and recreation;
facilitate reduction of governmental expenditures; conserve and develop the natural resources; and
foster and develop agriculture and other industries in the districts and places best suited to them.

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
    (c) Prior to meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided
that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site under
the procedures in section 331A.12. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to each
person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided in
chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this
paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities at the meeting.
    (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent
information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay
taking action on any parcel or parcels. In order for a state agency or a governmental subdivision of
the state to preserve its right to request a purchase or other acquisition of a forfeited parcel, it may,
at any time following forfeiture, file a written request to withhold the parcel from sale or lease to
others under the provisions of subdivision 1a.
    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
       (f) A county board may by resolution elect to use the classification and reclassification

procedures provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), instead of the procedures provided in paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d). Once an election is made under this paragraph, it is effective for a minimum of
five years.
    (g) The classification or reclassification of tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released
from the trust may be made by the county board using information made available to it by any
office or department of the federal, state, or local governments, or by any other person or agency
possessing pertinent information at the time the classification is made.
    (h) If the lands are located within the boundaries of an organized town or incorporated
municipality, a classification or reclassification and sale must first be approved by the town board
of the town or the governing body of the municipality in which the lands are located. The town
board of the town or the governing body of the municipality is considered to have approved the
classification or reclassification and sale if the county board is not notified of the disapproval of
the classification or reclassification and sale within 60 days of the date the request for approval
was transmitted to the town board of the town or governing body of the municipality. If the town
board or governing body disapproves of the classification or reclassification and sale, the county
board must follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) and (d), with regard to the parcel, and must
additionally cause to be published in a newspaper a notice of the date, time, location, and purpose
of the required meeting.
    (i) If a town board or a governing body of a municipality desires to acquire any parcel lying in
the town or municipality by procedures authorized in this section, it may file a written request under
subdivision 1a, paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:

                                      l­y­ to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state
agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be
withheld from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted
to the county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease
to any other party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding
period to the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision
of the state, the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county
during the period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to
the requesting party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting
party terminates the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property ­o­
                                                                                           r. When
the term "market value" is used in this section, it means an estimate of the full and actual market

value of the parcel as determined by the county board, but in making this determination, the board
and the persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist
in the determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application ­
                         o­f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market, or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.
      (e) Nonconservation tax-forfeited land held in trust in favor of the taxing districts may be
conveyed by the commissioner of revenue m                   ­­ay­­­­

means a use that allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property
in numbers appropriate to its size and use, or is for a public service facility. Authorized public uses
as defined in this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, ball fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit ways for buses or commuter trains;

    (f) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision of the state by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the
favorable recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the
board that prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement, but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration
is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that prior to forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed
to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions
attach to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state
for less than its market value for either: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant
limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed
back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall be
refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.

property to the approved authorized public use for which it was conveyed, or an abandonment of
that use, except as provided in subdivision 1d.

failure to put the land to the authorized public use and no abandonment of that use if a formal plan
of the governmental subdivision shows an intended future use of the land for the authorized public
use.
   (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue after January 1, 2006, may be acquired by that
governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the conveyance if the commissioner

determines upon written application from the subdivision that the subdivision has in fact put the
property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed, and the subdivision has made a
finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Prior to conveying the property,
the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land is located objects to a
conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without further act by or
obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the commissioner
makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on behalf of the
state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For purposes of this
paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in a formal plan
of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.
    (c) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue before January 1, 2006, is released from the use restriction
and possibility of reversion on January 1, 2021, if the county board records a document describing
the land and citing this paragraph. The county board may authorize the county treasurer to deduct
the amount of the recording fees from future settlements of property taxes to the subdivision.
    (d) All property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue is released from the use restriction and possibility of
reversion on the later of: (1) January 1, 2015; (2) 40 years after the date the deed was executed; or (3)
upon final resolution of an appeal to district court under subdivision 1e if the appeal was commenced
prior to January 1, 2015. Upon the occurrence of clause (1), (2), or (3), the governmental subdivision
may record a certificate referring to the land, the original conveyance, and to the release under this
paragraph.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1g. Conditional use deed fees. (a) A governmental subdivision of the state applying
for a conditional use deed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), must submit a fee of $250 to the
commissioner of revenue along with the application. If the application is denied, the commissioner
shall refund $150 of the application fee.
   (b) The proceeds from the fees must be deposited in a Department of Revenue conditional
use deed revolving fund. The sums deposited into the revolving fund are appropriated to the
commissioner of revenue for the purpose of making the refunds described in this subdivision, and
administering conditional use deed laws.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for applications received by the commissioner
after June 30, 2009.

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
      Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonconservation lands; appraisal and sale. (a) All parcels of land classified as
nonconservation, except those which may be reserved, shall be sold as provided, if it is determined,
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie, that it is advisable to do so, having in
mind their accessibility, their proximity to existing public improvements, and the effect of their
sale and occupancy on the public burdens. Any parcels of land proposed to be sold shall be first
appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
    (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall
submit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the first publication of the list of lands to be
offered for sale a list of all lands included on the list which are situated outside of any incorporated
municipality. If, at any time before the opening of the sale, the commissioner notifies the county
auditor in writing that there is standing timber on any parcel of ­    su
                                                                        ­­ch
                                                                           ­ land, the parcel shall not be
sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
      (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until
the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                            I­n­­  l­­

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only
(1) a payment of at least ten percent of the purchase price must be made at the time of purchase, and
the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber
or timber products must not be removed from these lands until an amount equal to the appraised
value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid
by the purchaser. If a parcel of land bearing standing timber or timber products is sold at public
auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the
excess bid allocated to timber or timber products has been paid in addition to the appraised value of
the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is
applicable. Interest on the unpaid contract balance on sales occurring before July 1, 1982, is payable
at the rate applicable to the sale at the time that the sale occurred.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. County sales; notice, purchase price, disposition. The sale must commence at the time
determined by the county board of the county in which the parcels are located. The county auditor
shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are

sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as
provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. City sales; alternate procedures. Land located in a home rule charter or statutory
city, or in a town which cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local ordinances
regarding minimum area, shape, frontage or access may be sold by the county auditor pursuant to
this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics
of the land indicate that its highest and best use will be achieved by combining it with an adjoining
parcel and the city or town has not adopted a local ordinance governing minimum area, shape,
frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists
of an undivided interest in land or land and improvements, the property may also be sold to the
other owners under this subdivision. The sale of land pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject
to any conditions imposed by the county board pursuant to section 282.03. The governing body of
the city or town may recommend to the county board conditions to be imposed on the sale. The
county auditor may restrict the sale to owners of lands adjoining the land to be sold. The county
auditor shall conduct the sale by sealed bid or may select another means of sale. The land shall be
sold to the highest bidder b ­u

  Sec. 2. [116J.408] CONSTRUCTION CREDIT FREEZE; TEMPORARY LOAN
GUARANTEE ACCOUNT.
    Subdivision 1. Findings. The legislature finds that the construction industry in this state is being
damaged by a credit freeze imposed by private lenders. If credit is extended, it is being extended for
an amount much less than has historically been the case with the result that there is a capital shortage
to complete construction projects. The credit freeze has resulted in the delay or cancellation of many
44TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29, 2009                                         3499

construction projects resulting in significant harm to the state economy, including the elimination
of thousands of jobs and the loss of significant tax revenues. A temporary state guarantee program
for a portion of a private loan may contribute to the thawing of the credit freeze to the benefit of the
state and its citizens.
    Subd. 2. Construction loan guarantee program created. The commissioner of employment
and economic development shall administer a program under this section to guarantee loans by a
private lender for construction projects in this state that will commence on or after July 1, 2009. A
loan guarantee may not be made after December 31, 2012.
   Subd. 3. Eligible projects. A project is eligible for a guarantee under this section if it has a private
loan commitment of $5,000,000 or more to pay for the costs of a related residential, commercial,
industrial, or institutional construction project.
    Subd. 4. Guarantee amount limits. A guarantee may not be made for more than 25 percent of
the principal amount of the loan made by a private lender.
   Subd. 5. Loan guarantee application process. The commissioner shall develop an application
form by which a person may apply for a loan guarantee. The application shall request information
required by the commissioner to determine whether a project loan is eligible for a guarantee
and to determine whether a guarantee should be issued. The application may be submitted by a
lender, developer, or jointly by a lender and a project developer. The commissioner shall issue loan
guarantees quarterly. The first round of guarantees must be issued for applications submitted by
June 30, 2009.
    Subd. 6. Guarantee criteria. In issuing loan guarantees for projects, the commissioner shall
attempt to distribute the projects throughout the state. The commissioner shall require information
from an applicant concerning the number of jobs involved in a project and the wages expected to
be paid for jobs related to the project and may consider the number of jobs created in relation to the
amount of a loan guarantee.
    Subd. 7. Construction loan guarantee account. A construction loan guarantee account is
established in the state treasury. Money in the account consists of money appropriated to the
account, interest and other earnings on money in the account, fees credited to the account under
subdivision 8, and sales and local taxes credited to the account under subdivision 9.
    Subd. 8. Guarantee fee. The commissioner shall charge a onetime loan guarantee issuance fee
of no more than three percent of the principal amount of the loan being guaranteed. Fees shall be
credited to the construction loan guarantee account.
    Subd. 9. Sales and use taxes. The amount collected from taxes imposed by chapter 297A, upon
retail sales, and upon the privilege of use, storage, or consumption in this state, of personal property
and services purchased for the construction of any project for which a loan guarantee has been
made, less any refunds required by law and a proportionate share of the cost of administration and
enforcement of the assessment and collection of the taxes, are appropriated from the general fund to
the commissioner of finance for transfer to the construction loan guarantee account at least once each
year from and after the date the guarantee was issued. The commissioner of finance shall determine
from information provided by the person to whom the loan guarantee was issued the amount of
taxes so imposed and from the information provided by the commissioner of revenue the amount of
refunds or costs to be deducted from them.

   Subd. 10. Limitation on guaranteed amount. The amount of all guaranties under this section
must not exceed funds in the construction loan guarantee account available to satisfy all outstanding
guaranties. Unless sufficient applications are not received, no less than 40 percent of all amounts
guaranteed shall be for projects located outside the seven-county metropolitan area. No more than
$50,000,000 may be guaranteed on any one project.
    Subd. 11. Appropriation. Money in the construction loan guarantee account is appropriated to
the commissioner of employment and economic development to make payments on loan guarantees
and to administer the loan guarantee program under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 4. [290.0681] CREDIT FOR HISTORIC STRUCTURE REHABILITATION.

government or a heritage preservation commission created under the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 and whose designation is approved by the state historic preservation officer.
    (c) "Eligible property" means a certified historic structure or a structure in a certified historic

    Subd. 2. Credit allowed. A taxpayer who incurs costs for the rehabilitation of eligible property
may take a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter in an amount equal to 25 percent of
the total costs of rehabilitation. Costs of rehabilitation include, but are not limited to, qualified
rehabilitation expenditures as defined under section 47(c)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code,
provided that the costs of rehabilitation must exceed 50 percent of the total basis in the property
at the time the rehabilitation activity begins and the rehabilitation must meet standards consistent
with the standards of the Secretary of the Interior for rehabilitation as determined by the State
Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society.
    Subd. 3. Carryback and carryforward. If the amount of the credit under subdivision 2 exceeds

44TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29, 2009                                         3503

    Subd. 5. Process. To claim the credit, the taxpayer must apply to the State Historic Preservation
Office of the Minnesota Historical Society before a historic rehabilitation project begins. The State
Historic Preservation Office shall determine the amount of eligible rehabilitation costs and whether
the rehabilitation meets the standards of the United States Department of the Interior. The State
Historic Preservation Office shall issue certificates verifying eligibility for and the amount of credit.
The taxpayer shall attach the certificate to any income tax return on which the credit is claimed.
The State Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society may collect fees for
applications for the historic preservation tax credit. Fees shall be set at an amount that does not
exceed the costs of administering the tax credit program.
    Subd. 6. Mortgage certificates; credit for lending institutions. (a) The taxpayer may elect, in
lieu of the credit otherwise allowed under this section, to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage
credit certificate.
     (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit is a certificate that
is issued to the taxpayer according to procedures prescribed by the State Historic Preservation Office
with respect to the certified rehabilitation and meets the requirements of this paragraph. The face
amount of the certificate must be equal to the credit that would be allowable under subdivision 2
to the taxpayer with respect to the rehabilitation. The certificate may only be transferred by the
taxpayer to a lending institution, including a nondepository home mortgage lending institution, in
connection with a loan:
   (1) that is secured by the building with respect to which the credit is issued; and
   (2) the proceeds of which may not be used for any purpose other than the acquisition or
rehabilitation of the building.
    (c) In exchange for the certificate, the lending institution must provide to the taxpayer an amount
equal to the face amount of the certificate discounted by the amount by which the federal income tax
liability of the lending institution is increased due to its use of the certificate in the manner provided
in this section. That amount must be applied, as directed by the taxpayer, in whole or in part, to
reduce:
   (1) the principal amount of the loan;
   (2) the rate of interest on the loan; or
    (3) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the building, but only in the case of a qualified historic home
that is located in a poverty-impacted area as designated by the State Historic Preservation Office.
    (d) The lending institution may take as a credit against the tax due under this chapter an amount
equal to the amount specified in the certificate. If the amount of the discount retained by the lender
exceeds the amount by which the lending institution's federal income tax liability is increased
due to the use of a mortgage credit certificate, the excess shall be refunded to the borrower with
interest at the rate prescribed by the State Historic Preservation Office. The lending institution may
carry forward all unused credits under this subdivision until exhausted. Nothing in this subdivision
requires a lending institution to accept a historic rehabilitation certificate from any person.
    Subd. 7. National landmarks. Notwithstanding subdivision 2, the rehabilitation of a property
designated as a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places shall be
eligible for the credit under this section provided that:

that a project is an eligible low-income housing project. The statement must set forth the taxable year
in which the project is placed in service, the dollar amount of low-income housing credit allocated to
the project as provided in subdivision 5, the applicable percentage and maximum qualified basis with
respect to the project taken into account in determining the dollar amount, sufficient information to
identify each project and the taxpayer or taxpayers who may claim a credit for each project, and other
information as the agency, in consultation with the commissioners of revenue and finance, prescribe.

housing projects shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter for the amount
of low-income housing credit allocated by the agency or a suballocator to the project. The credit
amount allocated shall be allowed as a credit against the tax for the ten taxable years in the credit
period, provided the credit allowable for the first taxable year of the credit period for any project
shall be adjusted as provided in section 42(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and any reduction in
first-year credit by reason of the adjustment shall be allowable for the first taxable year following
the credit period.
   Subd. 3. Amount of credit. Except as provided in subdivisions 4 and 5, the amount of
low-income housing credit shall be the applicable percentage multiplied by the qualified basis of
each eligible low-income project.
    Subd. 4. Statewide limitation. The aggregate dollar amount of credit available for eligible
low-income housing projects under this section is one-half the dollar amount of the federal

for federal credits and the allocation process shall be as provided in section 462A.222. The state
credit need not be allocated in the same proportion among eligible low-income projects as the
federal credit. The limitation provided by this subdivision applies only to allocation of the annual
aggregate dollar amount of credit to be allocated by the agency and the suballocators, and does not
apply to allowance to a taxpayer of the credit with respect to an eligible low-income building for
each year of the credit period.

    Subd. 5. Project allocation limitation. The dollar amount of credit allocated to any project
must not exceed the amount the agency and the suballocators determine is necessary for the financial
feasibility of the project as an eligible low-income project throughout the credit period. In allocating
a dollar amount of credit to any eligible low-income project, the agency and suballocators must
specify the applicable percentage and the maximum qualified basis that may be taken into account
under this section with respect to the project. The applicable percentage and the maximum qualified
basis for a project must not exceed the amounts determined under this subdivision.
    Subd. 6. Long-term commitment to low-income housing required. No credit shall be allowed
under this section with respect to a project or the taxable year, unless an extended low-income
housing commitment is in effect as of the end of the taxable year. In this subdivision, the term
"extended low-income housing commitment" means an agreement between the taxpayer and the
agency or suballocator, substantially similar to the agreement specified in section 42(h)(6)(B) of the
Internal Revenue Code.
    Subd. 7. Credit to successor owner. If a credit is allowed under this section to an eligible
low-income housing project and the project or an interest in it is sold during the credit period, the
credit for the period after the sale that would have been allowable to the prior owner had the project
not been sold shall be allowable to the new owner. Credit for the year of sale shall be allocated
between the parties on the basis of the number of days during the year that the project interest was
held by each.
    Subd. 8. Project monitoring. The agency shall establish procedures it deems necessary for
monitoring compliance of all eligible low-income projects with the provisions of this section and
section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code and for notifying the commissioners of revenue and finance
of any known noncompliance. The procedure shall utilize existing procedures for monitoring the
federal low-income housing tax credit compliance with section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Subd. 9. Credit recapture. If, as of the close of any taxable year in the compliance period, the
amount of the qualified basis of any low-income housing project for the taxpayer is less than the
amount of the basis as of the close of the preceding taxable year, the credit under this section may
be recaptured under a procedure to be established by the commissioner of revenue.
    Subd. 10. Education and promotion. The agency, in cooperation with the suballocators, shall
conduct a series of educational seminars and promotional events targeted to corporations with major
operations in Minnesota to inform potentially interested purchasers of the state credit regarding the
program and shall facilitate and encourage creation of state credit buyer pools to acquire federal and
state credits in Minnesota.
