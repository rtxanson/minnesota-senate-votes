    (2) $120,000 or more, during a fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, and fiscal years thereafter,
must remit by electronic means all liabilities in the manner provided in paragraph (a), clause (2),
on returns due for periods beginning in the subsequent calendar year, except for 90 percent of the
estimated June liability, which is due two business days before June 30. The remaining amount of
the June liability is due on August 20.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) or (c), a person prohibited by the person's religious beliefs
from paying electronically shall be allowed to remit the payment by mail. The filer must notify
the commissioner of revenue of the intent to pay by mail before doing so on a form prescribed by
the commissioner. No extra fee may be charged to a person making payment by mail under this

making the payment in order to be considered paid on a timely basis.
    (e) Whenever the liability is $120,000 or more separately for (1) the tax imposed under chapter
297A, (2) a fee that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes,
or (3) any other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A
taxes, then the payment of all the liabilities on the return must be accelerated as provided in this
subdivision.
    (f) At the start of the first calendar quarter at least 90 days after the cash flow account established
in section 16A.152, subdivision 1, and the budget reserve account established in section 16A.152,
subdivision 1a, reach the amounts listed in section 16A.152, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), the
remittance of estimated sales tax collections by the 14th day of a month required under paragraph
(a), clause (2), shall be suspended. The commissioner of management and budget shall notify the
commissioner of revenue when the accounts have reached the required amounts. Beginning with
the suspension of paragraph (a), clause (2), for a vendor with a liability of $120,000 or more during
a fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, and fiscal years thereafter, the taxes imposed by chapter 297A
are due and payable to the commissioner on the 20th day of the month following the month in
which the taxable event occurred. Payments of tax liabilities for taxable events occurring in June
under paragraph (b) are not changed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes due and payable after September 1,
2010.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.60, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 31. Accelerated payment of monthly sales tax liability; penalty for underpayment.
For payments made after September 1, 2010, if a vendor is required by section 289A.20, subdivision
4, to remit a 90 percent payment by the 14th of the month following the month in which the taxable
event occurred, as an estimation of monthly sales tax liabilities, including the liability of any fee or
other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes, for the
month in which the taxable event occurred, the vendor shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of the
amount of liability that was required to be paid by the 14th of the month less the amount remitted
by the 14th of the month. The penalty must not be imposed, however, if the amount remitted by
the 14th of the month equals the lesser of (1) 90 percent of the liability for the month preceding the
month in which the taxable event occurred, (2) 90 percent of the liability of the same month in the
previous calendar year as the month in which the taxable event occurred, or (3) 90 percent of the
average monthly liability for the previous calendar year.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes due and payable after September 1,

1, 2009; October 1, 2010; October 1, 2011; and October 1, 2012, no rate adjustments shall be
implemented under this section, but shall be determined under section 256B.434. For the rate year
beginning October 1, 2013, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 65 percent of
the operating payment rate from this section, and 35 percent of the operating payment rate from
section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2014, the operating payment rate for each
facility shall be 82 percent of the operating payment rate from this section, and 18 percent of the
operating payment rate from section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2015, the
operating payment rate for each facility shall be the operating payment rate determined under this
section. The blending of operating payment rates under this section shall be performed separately
for each RUG's class.
   (b) For the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the commissioner shall apply limits to the
operating payment rate increases under paragraph (a) by creating a minimum percentage increase
and a maximum percentage increase.
    (1) Each nursing facility that receives a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase
under paragraph (a) of less than one percent, when compared to its operating payment rate on
September 30, 2008, computed using rates with RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive a rate adjustment
of one percent.
    (2) The commissioner shall determine a maximum percentage increase that will result in savings
equal to the cost of allowing the minimum increase in clause (1). Nursing facilities with a blended
October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under paragraph (a) greater than the maximum
percentage increase determined by the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment
rate on September 30, 2008, computed using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the
maximum percentage increase.
    (3) Nursing facilities with a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under
paragraph (a) greater than one percent and less than the maximum percentage increase determined by
the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment rate on September 30, 2008, computed
using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the blended October 1, 2008, operating
payment rate increase determined under paragraph (a).
    (4) The October 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, operating payment rate for facilities receiving
the maximum percentage increase determined in clause (2) shall be the amount determined under
paragraph (a) less the difference between the amount determined under paragraph (a) for October 1,
2008, and the amount allowed under clause (2). This rate restriction does not apply to rate increases
provided in any other section.

payment rates that a facility would have received under section 256B.434, as determined in
accordance with clauses (1) to (3), shall be subject to the requirements in section 256B.434,
subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h).
    (1) Determine the amount of additional funding available to a facility, which shall be equal
to total medical assistance resident days from the most recent reporting year times the difference
between the blended rate determined in paragraph (a) for the rate year being computed and the
blended rate for the prior year.
   (2) Determine the portion of all operating costs, for the most recent reporting year, that are
compensation related. If this value exceeds 75 percent, use 75 percent.
   (3) Subtract the amount determined in clause (2) from 75 percent.
    (4) The portion of the fund received under this subdivision that shall be subject to the
requirements in section 256B.434, subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h), shall equal the amount
determined in clause (1) times the amount determined in clause (3).

specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing plan's

medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be
quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance
target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must
be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, including characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July of the

    (e) Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require
that managed care plans use the assessment and authorization processes, forms, timelines, standards,
documentation, and data reporting requirements, protocols, billing processes, and policies consistent
with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract requirements
consistent with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract

    (ii) has a tax regime that lacks transparency. A tax regime lacks transparency if the details of
legislative, legal, or administrative provisions are not open and apparent or are not consistently
applied among similarly situated taxpayers, or if the information needed by tax authorities
to determine a taxpayer's correct tax liability, such as accounting records and underlying
documentation, is not adequately available;

substantive presence or prohibits these entities from having any commercial impact on the local
economy;
    (iv) explicitly or implicitly excludes the jurisdiction's resident taxpayers from taking advantage
of the tax regime's benefits or prohibits enterprises that benefit from the regime from operating in
the jurisdiction's domestic markets; or

of relevant factors, including whether the jurisdiction has a significant untaxed offshore financial or
other services sector relative to its overall economy.

     "Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.17, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Unitary business principle. (a) If a trade or business conducted wholly within this
state or partly within and partly without this state is part of a unitary business, the entire income
of the unitary business is subject to apportionment pursuant to section 290.191. Notwithstanding
subdivision 2, paragraph (c), none of the income of a unitary business is considered to be derived
from any particular source and none may be allocated to a particular place except as provided by
the applicable apportionment formula. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to business
income subject to subdivision 5, income of an insurance company, or income of an investment
company determined under section 290.36.
    (b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of
value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities
and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a
trust.
    (c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by
centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other
controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence
a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual
benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.
    (d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries
on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the
other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations
are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the
contrary.
    (e) Unity of ownership is not deemed to exist when a corporation is involved unless that
corporation is a member of a group of two or more business entities and more than 50 percent
of the voting stock of each member of the group is directly or indirectly owned by a common
owner or by common owners, either corporate or noncorporate, or by one or more of the member
corporations of the group. For this purpose, the term "voting stock" shall include membership
interests of mutual insurance holding companies formed under section 66A.40.
     (f) The net income and apportionment factors under section 290.191 or 290.20 of foreign
corporations and other foreign entities which are part of a unitary business shall not be included
in the net income or the apportionment factors of the unitary business. A foreign corporation or
other foreign entity which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate
return basis. T   ­h

the vendee with a list of the repairs made and a notice that the vendee may have a right to pursue
a warranty claim under this chapter. Provision of this statement is not an admission of liability.
Compliance with this subdivision does not affect any rights of the vendee under this chapter.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327A.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Right to repair; agreement. (a) Within 15 days of completion of the inspection
required by subdivision 4, the vendor or home improvement contractor must provide to the vendee
or owner a written offer to repair. The offer to repair must include, at a minimum:
    (1) the scope of the proposed repair work; and
    (2) the proposed date on which the repair work would begin and the estimated date of completion.
   (b) This subdivision does not prevent the vendee or owner from obtaining the information in
paragraph (a) from another contractor or from negotiating with the vendor or home improvement
contractor for a different scope of work.
    (c) If the parties agree to a scope of work, the vendor or home improvement contractor must
perform the repair work in accordance with the offer to repair. If the parties do not agree to a scope
of work, the vendee or owner must submit the matter to the homeowner warranty dispute resolution
process under section 327A.051.
   (d) Upon completion of repairs described in an offer to repair, the vendor or home improvement
contractor must provide the vendee or owner with a written notice that the scope of the work agreed
upon has been completed.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327A.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

perform agreed upon repairs under subdivision 5, the vendee or owner may commence an action.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327A.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 7. Processes required before commencement of action. Except as provided in
subdivision 6, a cause of action for which the statute of limitations or statute of repose is tolled
under subdivision 4, paragraph (b), must not be commenced in district court until the earlier of:
   (1) the completion of the home warranty dispute resolution process under section 327A.051; or
   (2) 60 days after the written offer of repair is provided to the vendee or owner.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327A.03, is amended to read:
   327A.03 EXCLUSIONS.
    The liability of the vendor or the home improvement contractor under sections 327A.01 to
327A.07 is limited to the specific items set forth in sections 327A.01 to 327A.07 and does not
extend to the following:

should have discovered the loss or damage; unless the vendee or owner establishes that the vendor
or home improvement contractor had actual notice of the loss or damage;
    (b) loss or damage caused by defects in design, installation, or materials which the vendee or
the owner supplied, installed, or directed to be installed;

    (m) accidental loss or damage usually described as acts of God, including, but not limited to:

    (o) loss or damage due to soil conditions where construction is done upon lands owned by the
vendee or the owner and obtained by the vendee or owner from a source independent of the vendor
or the home improvement contractor;
   (p) in the case of home improvement work, loss or damage due to defects in the existing structure
and systems not caused by the home improvement.
   Sec. 11. [327A.051] HOME WARRANTY DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
    Subdivision 1. Panel of neutrals. (a) The commissioner of labor and industry shall maintain
a list of persons who consent to serve as qualified neutrals for purposes of this section. The
commissioner shall establish application requirements and qualifications for qualified neutrals,
taking into consideration the education, experience, and training of the applicant, potential conflicts
of interest, and that the purpose of the process is to assist parties in determining an agreeable scope
of repair or other resolution of their dispute.
    (b) As a condition of being included on the panel of neutrals identified in this section, the
commissioner of labor and industry may charge each qualified neutral a fee of $200 per year for
the administration of the home warranty dispute resolution process.
    Subd. 2. Dispute resolution process. (a) The home warranty dispute resolution process required
by this section is commenced by written application to the commissioner. A request must include
the complete current address and full name of the contact person for each participating party.
   (b) Within ten days of receiving a written request, the commissioner shall provide each party
with a written list of three qualified neutrals randomly selected from the panel of neutrals established
under subdivision 1. The commissioner shall also provide complete contact information for each
qualified neutral.
    (c) Within five business days after receipt of the list from the commissioner, the parties shall
mutually select one of the three qualified neutrals identified by the commissioner to serve as the
qualified neutral for their dispute. If the parties cannot mutually agree on a neutral, the vendor or
home improvement contractor shall strike one of the neutrals from the list, the vendee or owner
shall subsequently strike one of the remaining neutrals from the list, and the remaining neutral shall
serve as the qualified neutral for the dispute resolution process. The parties shall notify the selected
qualified neutral and the commissioner of the selection.
    Subd. 3. Neutral evaluation; fee. (a) The qualified neutral selected by the parties shall convene,
and each party shall attend, an in-person conference of the parties. The qualified neutral shall select
the date for the conference after consulting the parties. The conference must occur no later than
30 days after the neutral's selection, except by mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, the
neutral shall collect from each party an administrative fee of $25 and shall submit those fees to the
commissioner no later than ten days after the completion of the conference.
101ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                         10883

    (b) At least seven days before the conference, each party must provide the qualified neutral and
the other party with all information and documentation necessary to understanding the dispute, or
the alleged loss or damages.
    (c) After reviewing the information and documentation provided by the parties and after
consulting with the parties at the conference, the neutral shall issue to the parties a nonbinding,
written determination, which must include, to the extent possible, findings and recommendations on
the scope and amount of repairs necessary, if any. The qualified neutral shall mail the determination
to each party within ten days after the conference.
    (d) The parties shall share the expense of the qualified neutral's billed time equally, unless
otherwise agreed. The neutral's billed time for evaluation of documents, meeting with the parties,
and issuing a written determination must not exceed six hours, unless agreed to in writing by both
parties. The neutral must identify the neutral's hourly rate to the parties.
    Subd. 4. Alternative process. If both parties agree, the parties may designate an alternative
dispute resolution process in lieu of participating in the home warranty dispute resolution process
established by this section. If the parties agree to an alternative dispute resolution process, they shall
provide written notice of the agreement and a description of the selected process to the commissioner
as soon as practicable, but no later than the date the parties are required to select a neutral under
subdivision 2.
   Subd. 5. Effect on future proceedings. (a) The written determination issued by the qualified
neutral and all communications relating to the home warranty dispute resolution process, except
those between any party and the commissioner, are deemed confidential settlement communications
pursuant to Rule 408 of the Minnesota Rules of Evidence.
    (b) No party may use the written offer of repair provided by a vendor or home improvement
contractor, a counteroffer to repair, or a written determination issued by the qualified neutral as
evidence of liability in subsequent litigation between the parties. The qualified neutral may not be
called to testify regarding the dispute resolution proceedings.
    (c) Any amount paid by a party for the services of a qualified neutral under this section is deemed
a taxable cost of the prevailing party in a subsequent litigation involving the same subject matter.
    Subd. 6. Noncompliance with timelines; effect. Failure to strictly comply with the timelines in
this section shall not be grounds for dismissal of any claim brought under section 327A.05, provided
that the parties establish good faith effort in complying with this section.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 327A.08, is amended to read:
   327A.08 LIMITATIONS.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of sections 327A.01 to 327A.08:
   (a) the terms of the home improvement warranties required by sections 327A.01 to 327A.08
commence upon completion of the home improvement and the term shall not be required to be
renewed or extended if the home improvement contractor performs additional improvements
required by warranty;
   (b) the home improvement warranties required by sections 327A.01 to 327A.08 shall not include
10884                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [101ST DAY

products or materials installed that are already covered by implied or written warranty; and
    (c) the warranties required by sections 327A.01 to 327A.08 must be set forth as written warranty
instruments and must be included as part of the construction contract ­
                                                                      an­­

exclusions under section 327A.03, the right to inspect and offer to repair under section 327A.02,
subdivisions 4 and 5, and the home warranty dispute resolution process under section 327A.051
must be conveyed in writing to the owner. Failure to comply with this paragraph is a violation of
section 326B.84.
    (d) If the warranties required by sections 327A.01 to 327A.08 are not provided to the owner in
writing as required by paragraph (c), they are implied statutory warranties that have the same effect
as if the vendor or home improvement contractor had complied with paragraph (c).
  (e) The owner's right under this section to receive the written warranty required under this section
may not be waived or modified by contract or otherwise. Any agreement that purports to waive or
modify the right to the written warranty required under this section is void.
  (f) This section does not limit the ability of the vendor or home improvement contractor and the
owner to enter into the agreements permitted under section 327A.04, subdivisions 2 and 3.
   Sec. 13. REPORT.
    By February 1, 2014, the commissioner of labor and industry shall report to the chairs and
ranking minority members of the committees of the legislature with jurisdiction over civil law
matters on the number of dispute resolution cases established under Minnesota Statutes, section
327A.051, and, to the extent possible, identify the number of cases that used the home warranty
dispute process and the number that used an alternative dispute resolution process under subdivision
4 of that section.
   Sec. 14. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICATION.
   Sections 1 and 2 and 4 to 11 are effective January 1, 2011, and apply to notices of claims given
and actions commenced on or after that date. Sections 3 and 12 are effective January 1, 2011, and
apply to contracts entered into on or after that date.
   Sections 1 to 12 do not revive claims already barred or extend any applicable statute of
limitations or repose."

(a), the commissioner may issue a new water use permit for the Mt. Simon-Hinckley aquifer for
nondomestic use if there are no feasible or practical alternatives to the use of the aquifer, and water
recycling and water conservation plans, as determined by the commissioner, are required under
the permit. The commissioner shall ensure that a holder of a permit issued under this paragraph is
implementing all water recycling and conservation plans required under the permit. This paragraph
does not apply within a metropolitan county, as defined in section 473.121, subdivision 4, or
Chisago County."

    Subd. 7. Conviction of a felony-level criminal sexual conduct offense. (a) Except as provided
in paragraph (e), the board shall not grant or renew a license to practice chiropractic to any person

   (e) The board may establish criteria whereby an individual convicted of an offense listed in
paragraph (a) of this subdivision may become licensed provided that the criteria:
   (1) utilize a rebuttable presumption that the applicant is not suitable for licensing or
credentialing;
   (2) provide a standard for overcoming the presumption; and
    (3) require that a minimum of ten years has elapsed since the applicant was released from any
incarceration or supervisory jurisdiction related to the offense.
   The board shall not consider an application under this paragraph if the board determines that the

the ten years immediately preceding application of a violation of any of the following:
   (1) sections 609.185 to 609.21, 609.221 to 609.223, 609.342 to 609.3451, or 617.23, subdivision
2 or 3;
     (2) any provision of chapter 152 that is punishable by a maximum sentence of 15 years or more;

    Subd. 10. C-BED eligibility determination. (a) A developer of a C-BED project may seek
a predetermination of C-BED eligibility from the commissioner of commerce at any time, and
must obtain a determination of C-BED eligibility from the commissioner of commerce, based on
the project's final financing terms, before construction may begin. In seeking a determination of
eligibility under this subdivision, a developer of a C-BED project must submit to the commissioner
of commerce detailed financial projections demonstrating that, based on a net present value analysis,
and applying the discount rate to qualifying revenues and gross revenues from a power purchase
agreement, the project meets the requirements of subdivision 2, paragraph (h), clause (1).
     (b) A project is not required to obtain a determination of C-BED eligibility under paragraph (a)
if it has received, prior to the effective date of this act, an opinion letter from the commissioner
indicating that the project qualifies as a C-BED project under this section.

    (c) The commissioner's determination of C-BED eligibility of a project that obtained its initial
opinion letter regarding C-BED eligibility from the commissioner or written notification from
the Midwest Independent Systems Operator (MISO) that the project retains a position in the
interconnection queue before the effective date of this act must be based on the laws applicable
at the time the initial opinion letter of C-BED eligibility was issued or the Midwest Independent
System Operator interconnection queue position was obtained. A project subject to this paragraph
may elect to have the determination of eligibility governed by the law in effect at the time of the
determination.

    Subd. 21d. Staffing service. A "staffing service" is an employer whose business involves
employing individuals directly for the purpose of furnishing temporary assignment workers to
clients of the staffing service.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.035, subdivision 23a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23a. Suitable employment. (a) Suitable employment means employment in the
applicant's labor market area that is reasonably related to the applicant's qualifications. In
determining whether any employment is suitable for an applicant, the degree of risk involved
to the health and safety, physical fitness, prior training, experience, length of unemployment,
prospects for securing employment in the applicant's customary occupation, and the distance of the
employment from the applicant's residence is considered.
    (b) In determining what is suitable employment, primary consideration is given to the temporary
or permanent nature of the applicant's separation from employment and whether the applicant has
favorable prospects of finding employment in the applicant's usual or customary occupation at the
applicant's past wage level within a reasonable period of time.
   If prospects are unfavorable, employment at lower skill or wage levels is suitable if the
applicant is reasonably suited for the employment considering the applicant's education, training,
work experience, and current physical and mental ability.
   The total compensation must be considered, including the wage rate, hours of employment,
method of payment, overtime practices, bonuses, incentive payments, and fringe benefits.
    (c) When potential employment is at a rate of pay lower than the applicant's former rate,
consideration must be given to the length of the applicant's unemployment and the proportion of
difference in the rates. Employment that may not be suitable because of lower wages during the
early weeks of the applicant's unemployment may become suitable as the duration of unemployment
lengthens.
    (d) For an applicant seasonally unemployed, suitable employment includes temporary work in
a lower skilled occupation that pays average gross weekly wages equal to or more than 150 percent
of the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount.
   (e) If a majority of the applicant's weeks of employment in the base period includes part-time
employment, part-time employment in a position with comparable skills and comparable hours that
pays comparable wages is considered suitable employment.
    Full-time employment is not considered suitable employment for an applicant if a majority of
the applicant's weeks of employment in the base period includes part-time employment.
   (f) To determine suitability of employment in terms of shifts, the arrangement of hours in addition
101ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                         10925

to the total number of hours is to be considered. Employment on a second, third, rotating, or split
shift is suitable employment if it is customary in the occupation in the labor market area.
   (g) Employment is not considered suitable if:
   (1) the position offered is vacant because of a labor dispute;
   (2) the wages, hours, or other conditions of employment are substantially less favorable than
those prevailing for similar employment in the labor market area; ­
                                                                  o­
                                                                   r
   (3) as a condition of becoming employed, the applicant would be required to join a company
union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization; or
   (4) the employment is with a staffing service and less than 45 percent of the applicant's wage
credits are from a job assignment with the client of a staffing service.
    (h) A job assignment with a staffing service is considered suitable only if 45 percent or more of
the applicant's wage credits are from job assignments with clients of a staffing service and the job
assignment meets the definition of suitable employment under paragraph (a).
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.046, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Tax accounts assigned. (a) Any person that contracts with a taxpaying employer
to have that person obtain the taxpaying employer's workforce and provide workers to the taxpaying
employer for a fee is, as of the effective date of the contract, assigned for the duration of the contract
the taxpaying employer's account under section 268.045. That tax account must be maintained by
the person separate and distinct from every other tax account held by the person and identified
in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. The tax account is, for the duration of the contract,
considered that person's account for all purposes of this chapter. The workers obtained from the
taxpaying employer and any other workers provided by that person to the taxpaying employer,
including officers of the taxpaying employer as defined in section 268.035, subdivision 20, clause
(28), whose wages paid by the person are considered paid in covered employment under section
268.035, subdivision 24, for the duration of the contract between the taxpaying employer and the
person, must, under section 268.044, be reported on the wage detail report under that tax account,
and that person must pay any taxes due at the tax rate computed for that account under section
268.051, subdivision 2.
    (b) Any workers of the taxpaying employer who are not covered by the contract under paragraph
(a) must be reported by the taxpaying employer as a separate unit on the wage detail report under the
tax account assigned under paragraph (a). Taxes and any other amounts due on the wages reported
by the taxpaying employer under this paragraph may be paid directly by the taxpaying employer.
    (c) If the taxpaying employer that contracts with a person under paragraph (a) does not have a tax
account at the time of the execution of the contract, an account must be registered for the taxpaying
employer under section 268.042 and the new employer tax rate under section 268.051, subdivision
5, must be assigned. The tax account is then assigned to the person as provided for in paragraph (a).
    (d) A person that contracts with a taxpaying employer under paragraph (a) must, within 30
calendar days of the execution or termination of a contract, notify the commissioner by electronic
transmission, in a format prescribed by the commissioner, of that execution or termination. The
taxpaying employer's name, the account number assigned, and any other information required by
10926                                           JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                    [101ST DAY

the commissioner must be provided by that person.
    (e) Any contract subject to paragraph (a) must specifically inform the taxpaying employer of
the assignment of the tax account under this section and the taxpaying employer's obligation under
paragraph (b). If there is a termination of the contract, the tax account is, as of the date of termination,
immediately assigned to the taxpaying employer.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.051, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

commissioner ­ sh

                 a­l
                   l­ must compute the tax rate of each taxpaying employer that qualifies for an
experience rating by adding the base tax rate to the employer's experience rating along with assigning

    (b) The base tax rate for the calendar year and any additional assessments under this subdivision
are determined based upon the amount in the trust fund on March 31 of the prior year as a percentage
of total wages paid in covered employment. The base tax rate is:
     (1) one-tenth of one percent if the trust fund is equal to or more than 0.75 percent;
   (2) two-tenths of one percent if the trust fund is less than 0.75 percent but equal to or more than
0.65 percent;
   (3) three-tenths of one percent if the trust fund is less than 0.65 percent but equal to or more than
0.55 percent; ­
              o­r
     (4) four-tenths of one percent if the trust fund is less than 0.55 percent, but has a positive balance;
or
    (5) five-tenths of one percent if the trust fund has a negative balance and is borrowing from
the federal unemployment trust fund in order to pay unemployment benefits as provided for under
section 268.194, subdivision 6.

    ­­) In addition to the base tax rate, there is an additional assessment for the calendar year on the
quarterly unemployment taxes due from every taxpaying employer if the amount in the trust fund
on March 31 of the prior year is less than 0.55 percent of total wages paid in covered employment.
The assessment is as follows:

   (1) a five percent assessment if the trust fund is less than 0.55 percent but equal to or more than
0.45 percent;
   (2) a ten percent assessment if the trust fund is less than 0.45 percent but equal to or more than
0.35 percent; or

to cover a portion of the costs to the trust fund for unemployment benefits paid that do not affect
any single employer's future experience rating because:
       (1) the employer's experience rating is limited by the maximum under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b);
       (2) the employer has ceased doing business; or
  (3) the unemployment benefits paid have been determined not to be used in computing the
employer's experience rating under section 268.047, subdivision 2 or 3.

    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.051, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Tax rate buydown. (a) Any taxpaying employer that has been assigned a tax rate based
upon an experience rating, and has no amounts past due under this chapter, may, upon the payment
of an amount equivalent to any portion or all of the unemployment benefits used in computing the
experience rating plus a surcharge of 25 percent, obtain a cancellation of unemployment benefits
used equal to the payment made, less the surcharge. The payment is applied to the most recent
unemployment benefits paid that are used in computing the experience rating. Upon the payment,
the commissioner ­sh

the commissioner may accept an applicant certification of wage credits, based upon the applicant's
records, and issue a determination of benefit account.
    (d) An employer must provide wage detail information on an applicant within five calendar days
of request by the commissioner, in a manner and format requested, when:
    (1) the applicant is using an alternate base period under section 268.035, subdivision 4, paragraph
(d); and
    (2) wage detail under section 268.044 is not yet required to have been filed by the employer.
    (e) The commissioner may, at any time within 24 months from the establishment of a benefit
account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended determination if
the commissioner finds that the wage credits listed in the determination w­­a­
                                                                             s were incorrect for any
reason. An amended determination of benefit account must be promptly sent to the applicant and
all base period employers, by mail or electronic transmission. This subdivision does not apply to
documents titled determinations of eligibility or determinations of ineligibility issued under section
268.101.
    (f) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly unemployment benefit
amount or maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, any unemployment benefits
that have been paid greater than the applicant was entitled is considered an overpayment of
unemployment benefits. A determination or amended determination issued under this section that
results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount of the overpayment
and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid unemployment benefits
must be repaid.

and must have performed services in covered employment in a calendar quarter that started after
the effective date of the prior benefit account. The wage credits for those services must be at least
eight times the weekly benefit amount on the prior benefit account. One of the reasons for this
paragraph is to prevent an applicant from establishing a second benefit account as a result of one
loss of employment.

weekly unemployment benefit amount available during the applicant's benefit year is the higher of:
   (1) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the base period, to a maximum of
66-2/3 percent of the state's average weekly wage; or
   (2) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the high quarter, to a maximum of
43 percent of the state's average weekly wage.
   The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (1) is computed by dividing the total wage
credits by 52. The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (2) is computed by dividing the
high quarter wage credits by 13.

Sunday in October. Once established, an applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount is not
affected by the last Sunday in October change in the state's maximum weekly unemployment
benefit amount.

lower of:

     Subd. 3a. Right of appeal. (a) A determination or amended determination of benefit account
is final unless an applicant or base period employer within 20 calendar days after the sending of
the determination or amended determination files an appeal. Every determination or amended
determination of benefit account must contain a prominent statement indicating in clear language
the consequences of not appealing. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with
section 268.105.
    (b) Any applicant or base period employer may appeal from a determination or amended
determination of benefit account on the issue of whether services performed constitute employment

an
 ­d­, whether the employment is considered covered employment, and whether money paid
constitutes wages. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    Subd. 3b. Limitations on applications and benefit accounts. (a) An application for
unemployment benefits is effective the Sunday of the calendar week that the application was
filed. An application for unemployment benefits may be backdated one calendar week before the
Sunday of the week the application was actually filed if the applicant requests the backdating at
the time the application is filed. An application may be backdated only if the applicant had no
employment during the period of the backdating. If an individual attempted to file an application
for unemployment benefits, but was prevented from filing an application by the department, the
application is effective the Sunday of the calendar week the individual first attempted to file an
application.
   (b) A benefit account established under subdivision 2 is effective the date the application for
unemployment benefits was effective.
   (c) A benefit account, once established, may later be withdrawn only if:
   (1) the applicant has not been paid any unemployment benefits on that benefit account; and
    (2) a new application for unemployment benefits is filed and a new benefit account is established
at the time of the withdrawal.
   A determination or amended determination of eligibility or ineligibility issued under section
268.101, that was sent before the withdrawal of the benefit account, remains in effect and is
not voided by the withdrawal of the benefit account. A determination of ineligibility requiring
subsequent earnings to satisfy the period of ineligibility under section 268.095, subdivision 10,
applies to the weekly unemployment benefit amount on the new benefit account.
   (d) An application for unemployment benefits is not allowed before the Sunday following the
expiration of the benefit year on a prior benefit account. Except as allowed under paragraph (c), an
applicant may establish only one benefit account each 52 calendar weeks.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for benefit accounts filed effective on or after the
first Sunday following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
   Subdivision 1. Eligibility conditions. An applicant may be eligible to receive unemployment
benefits for any week if:
    (1) the applicant has filed a continued request for unemployment benefits for that week under
section 268.0865;
   (2) the week for which unemployment benefits are requested is in the applicant's benefit year;
   (3) the applicant was unemployed as defined in section 268.035, subdivision 26;
    (4) the applicant was available for suitable employment as defined in subdivision 15. The
applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount is reduced one-fifth for each day the applicant
is unavailable for suitable employment. This clause does not apply to an applicant who is in

reemployment assistance training, or each day the applicant is on jury duty or serving as an election
judge;
    (5) the applicant was actively seeking suitable employment as defined in subdivision 16. This
clause does not apply to an applicant who is in reemployment assistance training or who was on
jury duty throughout the week;
    (6) the applicant has served a nonpayable w­­   ­n
                                                  i­i
                                                 a­t ­g­ period of one week that the applicant is
otherwise entitled to some amount of unemployment benefits. This clause does not apply if the
applicant would have been entitled to federal disaster unemployment assistance because of a
disaster in Minnesota, but for the applicant's establishment of a benefit account under section
268.07; and
    (7) the applicant has been participating in reemployment assistance services, such as job search
and resume writing classes, if the applicant has been determined in need of reemployment assistance
services by the commissioner, unless the applicant has good cause for failing to participate.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.085, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Business owners. (a) Wage credits from an employer may not be used for
unemployment benefit purposes by any applicant who:
   (1) individually, jointly, or in combination with the applicant's spouse, parent, or child owns or
controls directly or indirectly 25 percent or more interest in the employer; or
    (2) is the spouse, parent, or m

                                       ­­r child of any individual who owns or controls directly or
indirectly 25 percent or more interest in the employer.
    This subdivision is effective when the applicant has been paid five times the applicant's weekly
unemployment benefit amount in the current benefit year. This subdivision does not apply if the
applicant had wages paid in covered employment of $7,500 or more from the employer covered by
this subdivision in each of the 16 calendar quarters prior to the effective date of the benefit account
and all taxes due on those wages have been paid.
    (b) An officer of a taxpaying employer referred to in section 268.046, subdivision 1, is subject
to the limitations of this subdivision.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.085, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
    Subd. 16. Actively seeking suitable employment defined. (a) "Actively seeking suitable
employment" means those reasonable, diligent efforts an individual in similar circumstances would
make if genuinely interested in obtaining suitable employment under the existing conditions in the
labor market area. Limiting the search to positions that are not available or are above the applicant's
training, experience, and qualifications is not "actively seeking suitable employment."
    (b) To be considered "actively seeking suitable employment" an applicant must, when
reasonable, contact those employers from whom the applicant was laid off because of lack of work
and request suitable employment.
   (c) If reasonable prospects of suitable employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation do not exist, the applicant must actively seek other suitable employment to be
considered "actively seeking suitable employment." This applies to an applicant who is seasonally

unemployed.
   (d) Actively seeking a suitable job assignment or other employment with a staffing service is
considered actively seeking suitable employment.
    (e) An applicant who is seeking employment only through a union is considered actively seeking
suitable employment if the applicant is in an occupation where hiring in that locality is done through
the union. If the applicant is a union member who is restricted to obtaining employment among
signatory contractors in the construction industry, seeking employment only with those signatory
contractors is considered actively seeking employment. The applicant must be a union member in
good standing, registered with the union for employment, and in compliance with other union rules
to be considered "actively seeking suitable employment."
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.095, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
  Subd. 2. Quit defined. (a) A quit from employment occurs when the decision to end the
employment was, at the time the employment ended, the employee's.
    (b) An employee who has been notified that the employee will be discharged in the future, who
chooses to end the employment while employment in any capacity is still available, is considered
to have quit the employment.
    (c) An employee who seeks to withdraw a previously submitted notice of quitting is considered
to have quit the employment if the employer does not agree that the notice may be withdrawn.
     (d) An applicant who, within five calendar days after completion of a suitable ­et­m­p

     Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Discharge defined. (a) A discharge from employment occurs when any words or actions
101ST DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                        10935

by an employer would lead a reasonable employee to believe that the employer will no longer
allow the employee to work for the employer in any capacity. A layoff because of lack of work
is considered a discharge. A suspension from employment without pay of more than 30 calendar
days is considered a discharge.
    (b) An employee who gives notice of intention to quit the employment and is not allowed by
the employer to work the entire notice period is considered discharged from the employment as of
the date the employer will no longer allow the employee to work. If the discharge occurs within
30 calendar days before the intended date of quitting, then, as of the intended date of quitting, the
separation from employment is considered a quit from employment subject to subdivision 1.
   (c) The end of a job assignment with the client of a staffing service is considered a discharge
from employment with the staffing service unless section 268.095, subdivision 2, paragraph (d),
applies.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.095, subdivision 6, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 6. Employment misconduct defined. (a) Employment misconduct means any intentional,
negligent, or indifferent conduct, on the job or off the job that displays clearly:
   (1) a serious violation of the standards of behavior the employer has the right to reasonably
expect of the employee; or
   (2) a substantial lack of concern for the employment.
   (b) Regardless of paragraph (a), the following is not employment misconduct:
   (1) conduct that was a consequence of the applicant's mental illness or impairment;
   (2) conduct that was a consequence of the applicant's inefficiency or inadvertence;
   (3) simple unsatisfactory conduct;
   (4) conduct an average reasonable employee would have engaged in under the circumstances;

must be shown as provided for in subdivision 1, clause (9).
    (c) Regardless of paragraph (b), clause (9), conduct in violation of sections 169A.20, 169A.31,
or 169A.50 to 169A.53 that interferes with or adversely affects the employment is employment
misconduct.
    (d) If the conduct for which the applicant was discharged involved only a single incident, that
is an important fact that must be considered in deciding whether the conduct rises to the level of
employment misconduct under paragraph (a).
   (e) The definition of employment misconduct provided by this subdivision is exclusive and no
other definition applies.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for determinations under section 268.101,
subdivision 2, and appeal decisions under section 268.105, subdivision 1, issued on and after the
Sunday following final enactment.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Telephone number. Every determination issued under subdivision 2 must include a
prominently displayed telephone number that an applicant or involved employer can call to speak
with an unemployment insurance specialist and obtain further explanation about the determination
and have any questions answered. The specialist must, when appropriate, issue an amended
determination as provided for in subdivision 4. The listed telephone number must be unique to a
specialized call group trained to handle calls involving determinations.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 3, 2010, and expires September 30, 2012.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.105, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Evidentiary hearing by unemployment law judge. (a) Upon a timely appeal
having been filed, the department must send, by mail or electronic transmission, a notice of appeal
to all involved parties that an appeal has been filed, and that a de novo due process evidentiary
hearing will be scheduled. The notice must set out the parties' rights and responsibilities regarding
the hearing. The notice must explain that the facts will be determined by the unemployment law
judge based upon a preponderance of the evidence. The notice must explain in clear and simple
language the meaning of the term "preponderance of the evidence." The department must set a time
and place for a de novo due process evidentiary hearing and send notice to any involved applicant
and any involved employer, by mail or electronic transmission, not less than ten calendar days before
the date of the hearing.
    (b) The evidentiary hearing is conducted by an unemployment law judge as an evidence
gathering inquiry. At the beginning of the hearing the unemployment law judge must fully explain
how the hearing will be conducted, that the applicant has the right to request that the hearing be
rescheduled so that documents or witnesses can be subpoenaed, that the facts will be determined
based on a preponderance of the evidence, and, in clear and simple language, the meaning of the
term "preponderance of the evidence." The unemployment law judge must ensure that all relevant
facts are clearly and fully developed. The department may adopt rules on evidentiary hearings. The
rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of
procedure. The department has discretion regarding the method by which the evidentiary hearing
101ST DAY]                          MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                        10937

is conducted. A report of any employee of the department, except a determination, made in the
regular course of the employee's duties, is competent evidence of the facts contained in it. An
affidavit or written statement based on personal knowledge and signed under penalty of perjury
is competent evidence of the facts contained in it; however, the veracity of statements contained
within the document or the credibility of the witness making the statement may be disputed with
other documents or testimony and production of such documents or testimony may be compelled
by subpoena.
     (c) After the conclusion of the hearing, upon the evidence obtained, the unemployment law judge
must make findings of fact and decision and send those, by mail or electronic transmission, to all
involved parties. When the credibility of an involved party or witness testifying in an evidentiary
hearing has a significant effect on the outcome of a decision, the unemployment law judge must set
out the reason for crediting or discrediting that testimony. The unemployment law judge's decision
is final unless a request for reconsideration is filed under subdivision 2.
   (d) Regardless of paragraph (c), if the appealing party fails to participate in the evidentiary
hearing, the unemployment law judge has the discretion to dismiss the appeal by summary order.
By failing to participate, the appealing party is considered to have failed to exhaust available
administrative remedies unless the appealing party files a request for reconsideration under
subdivision 2 and establishes good cause for failing to participate in the evidentiary hearing under
subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Submission of a written statement does not constitute participation.
The applicant must participate personally and appearance solely by a representative does not
constitute participation.
   (e) Only employees of the department who are attorneys licensed to practice law in Minnesota
may serve as the chief unemployment law judge, senior unemployment law judges who are
supervisors, or unemployment law judges. The commissioner must designate a chief unemployment
law judge. The chief unemployment law judge may transfer to another unemployment law judge
any proceedings pending before an unemployment law judge.
    (f) A full-time unemployment law judge must be paid a salary within a range directly tied to the
salary set under section 15A.083, subdivision 7, for a workers' compensation judge. The salary paid
within that range to any single unemployment law judge is based on experience and performance.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 268.136, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Shared work agreement requirements. (a) An employer may submit a proposed
shared work plan for an employee group to the commissioner for approval in a manner and format
set by the commissioner. The proposed agreement must include:
    (1) a certified statement that the normal weekly hours of work of all of the proposed participating
employees were full time but are now reduced, or will be reduced, with a corresponding reduction
in pay, in order to prevent layoffs;
   (2) the name and Social Security number of each participating employee;
   (3) a certified statement of when each participating employee was first hired by the employer,
which must be at least one year before the proposed agreement is submitted;
   (4) the hours of work each participating employee will work each week for the duration of the
10938                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                          [101ST DAY

agreement, which must be at least 20 hours and no more than 32 hours per week, except that the
agreement may provide for a uniform vacation shutdown of up to two weeks;
    (5) the proposed duration of the agreement, which must be at least two months and not more
than one year, although an agreement may be extended for up to an additional year upon approval
of the commissioner;
   (6) a starting date beginning on a Sunday at least 15 calendar days after the date the proposed
agreement is submitted; and
  (7) a signature of an owner or officer of the employer who is listed as an owner or officer on the
employer's account under section 268.045.
   (b) An agreement may not be approved for an employer that:
    (1) has any unemployment tax or reimbursements, including any interest, fees, or penalties, due
but unpaid; or
   (2) has the maximum experience rating provided for under section 268.051, subdivision 3;
                                                                                          ­­o

applicant passes the examination and before the license is issued.
   (b) If the applicant for a Minnesota license holds a license in another state and is seeking
101ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                          10945

Minnesota licensure without examination based on reciprocity, then the application for the
Minnesota license must be accompanied by the application and examination fee of $50, which is
separate from the license fee. If the commissioner approves the application, then the license fee is
due before the license is issued.
    Subd. 2. Licenses not requiring examination administered by commissioner. If the applicant
for a license is not required to pass an examination in order to obtain the license, or is required to pass
an examination that is not administered by the commissioner, then the license fee must accompany
the application for the license. If the application is for a license issued under sections 326B.802
to 326B.885 and is not an application for license renewal, then the contractor recovery fund fee
required under section 326B.89, subdivision 3, is due after the department has determined that the
applicant meets the qualifications for licensing and before the license is issued.
    Subd. 3. Late fee. The department must receive a complete application for license renewal by
the renewal deadline but not more than 90 days before the renewal deadline. If the department
receives a renewal application after the expiration of the license, then the renewal application must
be accompanied by a late fee equal to one-half of the license renewal fee; except that, for the purpose
of calculating the late fee only, the license renewal fee shall not include any contractor recovery fund

after expiration of the license, the renewal application must be accompanied by all license renewal
fees to cover the period that the license was expired, plus the late fee described in subdivision 3 and
the license renewal fee for the current renewal period.
    Subd. 5. Insufficient fees. If the applicant does not include all required fees with the application,
then the application will be incomplete and the department will notify the applicant of the amount
of the deficiency.
    Subd. 6. Fees nonrefundable. Application and examination fees, license fees, license renewal
fees, and late fees are nonrefundable except for:
    (1) license renewal fees received more than two years after expiration of the license, as described
in section 326B.094, subdivision 2;
   (2) any overpayment of fees; and
   (3) if the license is not renewed, the contractor recovery fund fee and any additional assessment
paid under subdivision 7, paragraph (e).
    Subd. 7. License fees and license renewal fees. (a) The license fee for each license except
a renewed license shall be the base license fee plus any applicable board fee, as set forth in this
subdivision. The license renewal fee for each renewed license is the base license fee plus any
applicable board fee, continuing education fee, and contractor recovery fund fee and additional
assessment, as set forth in this subdivision.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "license duration" means the number of years for which the
license is issued except that:
   (1) if the initial license is not issued for a whole number of years, the license duration shall be
rounded up to the next whole number; and

     (2) if the department receives an application for license renewal after the renewal deadline,
license duration means the number of years for which the renewed license would have been issued
if the renewal application had been submitted on time and all other requirements for renewal had
been met.
    (c) The base license fee shall depend on whether the license is classified as an entry level, master,
journeyman, or business license, and on the license duration. The base license fee shall be:
License Classification                     License Duration
                          1 Year                    2 Years                    3 Years
Entry level               $10                       $20                        $30
Journeyman                $20                       $40                        $60
Master                    $40                       $80                        $120
Business                  $90                       $180                       $270

    (d) If there is a continuing education requirement for renewal of the license, then a continuing
education fee must be included in the renewal license fee. The continuing education fee for all
license classifications shall be: $10 if the renewal license duration is one year; $20 if the renewal
license duration is two years; and $30 if the renewal license duration is three years.
    (e) If the license is issued under sections 326B.31 to 326B.59 or 326B.90 to 326B.93, then a
board fee must be included in the license fee and the renewal license fee. The board fee for all
license classifications shall be: $4 if the license duration is one year; $8 if the license duration is
two years; and $12 if the license duration is three years.
    (f) If the application is for the renewal of a license issued under sections 326B.802 to 326B.885,
then the contractor recovery fund fee required under section 326B.89, subdivision 3, and any
additional assessment required under section 326B.89, subdivision 16, must be included in the
license renewal fee.
  Sec. 5. [326B.093] LICENSES REQUIRING EXAMINATION ADMINISTERED BY
COMMISSIONER.
   Subdivision 1. Qualifications for examination. If the applicant for a license must pass an
examination administered by the commissioner in order to obtain the license, then the applicant's
complete application must demonstrate that the applicant is qualified to take the examination. The
applicant is qualified to take the examination if the applicant meets all requirements for the license
except for passing the examination.
   Subd. 2. Not qualified for examination. If the applicant is not qualified to take the examination,
then the commissioner must deny the application. The applicant may subsequently submit another
application, accompanied by the required fee.
   Subd. 3. Taking the examination. If the applicant is qualified to take the examination, then the
department must notify the applicant, and the applicant may schedule a time to take the examination
within one year after the notification date. If the applicant does not take the examination at the
scheduled time, the applicant may, one time only, reschedule a time to take the examination on
a date within one year after the notification date. If the applicant fails to take the examination

within one year after the notification date, the commissioner must deny the application and the
applicant forfeits the application/examination fee. The applicant may subsequently submit another
application, accompanied by the required application/examination fee.
    Subd. 4. Examination results. If the applicant receives a passing score on the examination and
meets all other requirements for licensure, the commissioner must approve the application and notify
the applicant of the approval within 60 days of the date of the passing score. The applicant must,
within 90 days after the notification of approval, pay the license fee. Upon receipt of the license fee,
the commissioner must issue the license. If the applicant does not pay the license fee within 90 days
after the notification of approval, the commissioner will rescind the approval and must deny the
application. If the applicant does not receive a passing score on the examination, the commissioner
must deny the application. If the application is denied because of the applicant's failure to receive a
passing score on the examination, then the applicant cannot submit a new application for the license
until at least 30 days after the notification of denial.
   Sec. 6. [326B.094] RENEWAL OF LICENSES.
    Subdivision 1. Expiration of licenses. Unless and until the department or commissioner issues
a renewal of a license, the license expires on the expiration date printed on the license. While the
license is expired, the licensee cannot perform the activities authorized by the license.
    Subd. 2. Availability of renewal. A licensee may apply to renew a license no later than two
years after the expiration of the license. If the department receives a complete renewal application
no later than two years after the expiration of the license, then the department must approve or
deny the renewal application within 60 days of receiving the complete renewal application. If the
department receives a renewal application more than two years after the expiration of the license,
the department must return the renewal license fee to the applicant without approving or denying
the application. If the licensee wishes to obtain a valid license more than two years after expiration
of the license, the licensee must apply for a new license.
    Subd. 3. Deadline for avoiding license expiration. The department must receive a complete
application to renew a license no later than the renewal deadline. If the department does not receive
a complete application by the renewal deadline, the license may expire before the department has
either approved or denied the renewal application.
   Sec. 7. [326B.095] INCOMPLETE LICENSE APPLICATIONS.
    This section applies to both applications for initial licenses and license renewal applications.
If the department determines that an application is incomplete, the department must notify the
applicant of the deficiencies that must be corrected in order to complete the application. If
the applicant wishes to complete the application, the department must receive the completed
application within 90 days after the date the department mailed or delivered the incomplete
application to the applicant. If the department does not receive the completed application by this
deadline, the commissioner must deny the application and the applicant will forfeit all fees except
as provided in section 326B.092, subdivision 6. If the application is for license renewal and the
department receives the corrected application after the license has expired, then the corrected
application must be accompanied by the late fee.
   Sec. 8. [326B.096] REINSTATEMENT OF LICENSES.
10948                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [101ST DAY

   Subdivision 1. Reinstatement after revocation. (a) If a license is revoked under this chapter
and if an applicant for a license needs to pass an examination administered by the commissioner
before becoming licensed, then, in order to have the license reinstated, the person who holds the
revoked license must:
   (1) retake the examination and achieve a passing score; and
   (2) meet all other requirements for an initial license, including payment of the application and
examination fee and the license fee. The person holding the revoked license is not eligible for
Minnesota licensure without examination based on reciprocity.
    (b) If a license is revoked under a chapter other than this chapter, then, in order to have the
license reinstated, the person who holds the revoked license must:
    (1) apply for reinstatement to the commissioner no later than two years after the effective date
of the revocation;
   (2) pay a $100 reinstatement application fee and any applicable renewal license fee; and
   (3) meet all applicable requirements for licensure, except that, unless required by the order
revoking the license, the applicant does not need to retake any examination and does not need to
repay a license fee that was paid before the revocation.
    Subd. 2. Reinstatement after suspension. If a license is suspended, then, in order to have the
license reinstated, the person who holds the suspended license must:
    (1) apply for reinstatement to the commissioner no later than two years after the completion of
the suspension period;
   (2) pay a $100 reinstatement application fee and any applicable renewal license fee; and
    (3) meet all applicable requirements for licensure, except that, unless required by the order
suspending the license, the applicant does not need to retake any examination and does not need
to repay a license fee that was paid before the suspension.
    Subd. 3. Reinstatement after voluntary termination. A licensee who is not an individual may
voluntarily terminate a license issued to the person under this chapter. If a licensee has voluntarily
terminated a license under this subdivision, then, in order to have the license reinstated, the person
who holds the terminated license must:
   (1) apply for reinstatement to the commissioner no later than the date that the license would have
expired if it had not been terminated;
   (2) pay a $100 reinstatement application fee and any applicable renewal license fee; and
   (3) meet all applicable requirements for licensure, except that the applicant does not need to
repay a license fee that was paid before the termination.
   Sec. 9. [326B.097] PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER.
   A licensee shall not transfer or sell any license.
   Sec. 10. [326B.098] CONTINUING EDUCATION.
101ST DAY]                          MONDAY, MAY 10, 2010                                       10949

   Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies to seminars offered by the department for the
purpose of allowing licensees to meet continuing education requirements for license renewal.
    Subd. 2. Rescheduling. An individual who is registered with the department to attend a seminar
may reschedule one time only, to attend the same seminar on a date within one year after the date
of the seminar the individual was registered to attend.
    Subd. 3. Fees nonrefundable. All seminar fees paid to the department are nonrefundable except
for any overpayment of fees.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.106, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Accessibility. (a) Public buildings. The code must provide for making public buildings
constructed or remodeled after July 1, 1963, accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities,
although this does not require the remodeling of public buildings solely to provide accessibility and
usability to persons with disabilities when remodeling would not otherwise be undertaken.
    (b) Leased space. No agency of the state may lease space for agency operations in a
non-state-owned building unless the building satisfies the requirements of the State Building
Code for accessibility by persons with disabilities, or is eligible to display the state symbol of
accessibility. This limitation applies to leases of 30 days or more for space of at least 1,000 square
feet.
    (c) Meetings or conferences. Meetings or conferences for the public or for state employees
which are sponsored in whole or in part by a state agency must be held in buildings that meet
the State Building Code requirements relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities. This
subdivision does not apply to any classes, seminars, or training programs offered by the Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities or the University of Minnesota. Meetings or conferences intended
for specific individuals none of whom need the accessibility features for persons with disabilities
specified in the State Building Code need not comply with this subdivision unless a person with a
disability gives reasonable advance notice of an intent to attend the meeting or conference. When
sign language interpreters will be provided, meetings or conference sites must be chosen which
allow hearing impaired participants to see their signing clearly.
    (d) Exemptions. The commissioner may grant an exemption from the requirements of
paragraphs (b) and (c) in advance if an agency has demonstrated that reasonable efforts were made
to secure facilities which complied with those requirements and if the selected facilities are the
best available for access for persons with disabilities. Exemptions shall be granted using criteria
developed by the commissioner in consultation with the Council on Disability.
    (e) Symbol indicating access. The wheelchair symbol adopted by Rehabilitation International's
Eleventh World Congress is the state symbol indicating buildings, facilities, and grounds which are
accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. In the interests of uniformity, this symbol is
the sole symbol for display in or on all public or private buildings, facilities, and grounds which
qualify for its use. The secretary of state shall obtain the symbol and keep it on file. No building,
facility, or grounds may display the symbol unless it is in compliance with the rules adopted by the
commissioner under subdivision 1. Before any rules are proposed for adoption under this paragraph,
the commissioner shall consult with the Council on Disability. Rules adopted under this paragraph
must be enforced in the same way as other accessibility rules of the State Building Code.

Two or more municipalities may combine in the designation of a building official for the purpose
of administering the provisions of the code within their communities. In those municipalities for
which no building officials have been designated, the state building official may use whichever state
employees are necessary to perform the duties of the building official until the municipality makes a
temporary or permanent designation. All costs incurred by virtue of these services rendered by state
employees must be borne by the involved municipality and receipts arising from these services must
be paid to the commissioner.
     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.133, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 2a. Application; renewal; fees; expiration. (a) An applicant for certification shall
submit a completed application on a form approved by the commissioner to the department. The
commissioner shall review applications for compliance with the requirements established by rule.
    (b) Application for initial certification or renewal certification as a building official, building
official-limited, or accessibility specialist shall be according to this section and sections 326B.092
to 326B.095.
     (c) Fees shall be paid to the department according to section 326B.092.
    (d) Unless revoked or suspended under this chapter, all certifications issued or renewed under

program developed or approved by the commissioner.
    Upon a determination of qualification under clause (1), (2), or (3), the commissioner shall issue
a certificate to the building official stating that the official is certified. E               ­­a­

commissioner or a designee may establish categories of certification that will recognize the varying
complexities of code enforcement in the municipalities within the state. The commissioner shall
provide educational programs designed to train and assist building officials in carrying out their
responsibilities.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.133, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Certification categories. (a) If a municipality has adopted or adopts the State Building
Code, the responsibilities for code administration and enforcement are under the authority of its
designated building official or the certified building official-limited.
    (b) Certified building official. This certification is identified as "certified building official" on
the certificate card. This certification is granted to an individual who has met the certified building
official requirements established by rule and passed the written examination prepared by the state.
A person with this certification may serve as the designated building official for any municipality.
For the purposes of calculating fees under section 326B.092, certification as a building official is a
master license.
    (c) Certified building official-limited. This certification is identified as "certified building
official-limited" on the certification card. This certification is granted to an individual who
has met the certified building official-limited requirements established by rule and passed the
written examination prepared by the state. An individual with this certification may perform code
administration for one- and two-family dwellings, their accessory structures, and "exempt classes
of buildings" as provided in Minnesota Rules, part 1800.5000, of the Board of Architecture,
Engineering, Land Surveying, Landscape Architecture, Geoscience, and Interior Design, and
"facilities for persons with physical disabilities" that are governed by the State Building Code.
Subject to the limitations of the building official-limited certification, an individual with this
certification may serve as the designated building official for any municipality. Code administration
for all other buildings must be performed by a certified building official as defined in paragraph
(b). A certified building official-limited may conduct inspections for other structures regulated by
the State Building Code under the direction of a designated certified building official or the state
building official.
    Subject to all other certification requirements, as of January 1, 2012, valid Class I certifications
shall be included in the certified building official-limited category upon the next immediate
renewal. For the purposes of calculating fees under section 326B.092, certification as a building
official-limited is a journeyman license.
    (d) Accessibility specialist. This certification is identified as accessibility specialist on the
certification card. This certification is granted to an individual who has met the "accessibility
specialist" requirements established by rule and passed the written examination prepared by the
state. An individual with this classification is limited to the administration of those provisions
of the State Building Code that provide access for persons with disabilities. For the purposes of
calculating fees under section 326B.092, certification as an accessibility specialist is a journeyman
license.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.133, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Continuing education requirements; extension of time. (a) This subdivision
establishes the number of continuing education units required within each two-year certification

period.
   A certified building official shall accumulate 16 continuing education units in any education
program that is approved under Minnesota Rules, part 1301.1000.
    A certified building official-limited shall, in each year of the initial two-year certification period,
accumulate eight continuing education units in any education program that is approved under
Minnesota Rules, part 1301.1000. Continuing education units shall be reported annually during
the initial two-year certification period by the method established in rule. A certified building
official-limited shall accumulate 16 continuing education units for each two-year certification
period thereafter in any education program that is approved under Minnesota Rules, part 1301.1000.
   An accessibility specialist must accumulate four continuing education units in any of the
programs described in Minnesota Rules, part 1301.1000, subpart 1 or 2. The four units must
be for courses relating to building accessibility, plan review, field inspection, or building code
administration.
   Continuing education programs may be approved as established in rule.
    (b) Subject to sections 326B.101 to 326B.194, the commissioner may by rule establish or
approve continuing education programs for certified building officials dealing with matters of
building code administration, inspection, and enforcement.
   Each person certified as a building official for the state must satisfactorily complete applicable
educational programs established or approved by the commissioner to ­    r­
                                                                          e­a

    (c) The state building official may grant an extension of time to comply with continuing
education requirements if the certificate holder requesting the extension of time shows cause for
the extension. The request for the extension must be in writing. For purposes of this section, the
certificate holder's current certification effective dates shall remain the same. The extension does
not relieve the certificate holder from complying with the continuing education requirements for
the next two-year period.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.133, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
   Subd. 11. Failure to renew. An individual who has failed to make a timely application for
renewal of a certificate is not certified and must not serve as the designated building official for any
municipality, or a certified building official, a certified building official-limited, or an accessibility
specialist until a renewed certificate has been issued by the commissioner.

    Subdivision 1. Application. The State Building Code's requirements for persons with

no ordinance in effect adopting the State Building Code, the county is responsible for enforcement
of the State Building Code's requirements for ­ d­s  ­­e

    Subd. 2. Municipal enforcement. Municipalities which have not adopted the State Building
Code shall enforce the State Building Code's requirements for persons with disabilities by: (1)
entering into a joint powers agreement for enforcement with another municipality which has adopted
the State Building Code; (2) contracting for enforcement with an individual certified under section
326B.133, subdivision 3, to enforce the State Building Code; or (3) hiring or training their own staff.
   Subd. 3. Responsibilities. Municipalities shall fulfill code responsibilities including duties
and responsibilities for code administration, plan review, and inspection in accordance with the
procedures established in the State Building Code.
    Subd. 4. Enforcement by state building official. If the commissioner determines that a
municipality is not properly administering and enforcing the State Building Code's requirements
for persons with disabilities, the commissioner may have the administration and enforcement
in the involved municipality undertaken by the state building official or by another building
official certified by the state. The commissioner shall notify the affected municipality in writing
immediately upon making the determination, and the municipality may challenge the determination
as a contested case before the commissioner pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. The
commissioner shall charge the fees set by section 326B.153 for the administration and enforcement
service rendered. Any cost to the state arising from the state administration and enforcement of the
State Building Code shall be borne by the subject municipality.
     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.197, is amended to read:
     326B.197 BOND REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTORS.
    (a) A person contracting to do gas, heating, ventilation, cooling, air conditioning, fuel burning,
or refrigeration work must give and maintain bond to the state in the amount of $25,000 for all work
entered into within the state. The bond must be for the benefit of persons suffering financial loss by
reason of the contractor's failure to comply with the requirements of the State Mechanical Code. A
bond given to the state must be filed with the commissioner of labor and industry and is in lieu of all
other bonds to any political subdivision required for work covered by this section. The bond must
be written by a corporate surety licensed to do business in the state.
    (b) The commissioner of labor and industry may charge each person giving bond under this
        an

     Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.33, subdivision 18, is amended to read:
      Subd. 18. Examination. In addition to the other requirements described in this section and
sections 326B.091 to 326B.098, and except as provided in subdivision 20, as a precondition to
issuance of a personal license, each applicant must pass a written or oral examination developed
and administered by the commissioner to ensure the competence of each applicant for license.
An oral examination shall be administered only to an applicant who furnishes a written statement
from a certified teacher or other professional, trained in the area of reading disabilities stating that
the applicant has a specific reading disability which would prevent the applicant from performing
satisfactorily on a written test. The oral examination shall be structured so that an applicant who

work as a journeyman plumber, a restricted journeyman plumber, and a restricted master plumber.
A journeyman plumber may also work as a restricted journeyman plumber. Anyone not so licensed
may do plumbing work which complies with the provisions of the minimum standards prescribed
by the Plumbing Board on premises or that part of premises owned and actually occupied by the
worker as a residence, unless otherwise forbidden to do so by a local ordinance.
    (b) No person shall engage in the business of planning, superintending, or installing plumbing
or shall install plumbing in connection with the dealing in and selling of plumbing material and
supplies unless at all times a licensed master plumber, or in cities and towns with a population
of fewer than 5,000 according to the last federal census, a restricted master plumber, who shall
be responsible for proper installation, is in charge of the plumbing work of the person,  ­

    (c) Except as provided in subdivision 2, no person shall perform or offer to perform plumbing
work with or without compensation unless the person obtains a contractor's license. A contractor's
license does not of itself qualify its holder to perform the plumbing work authorized by holding a
master, journeyman, restricted master, or restricted journeyman license.
   Subd. 1a. Exemptions from licensing. (a) An individual without a contractor license may do
plumbing work on the individual's residence in accordance with subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    (b) An individual who is an employee working on the maintenance and repair of plumbing
equipment, apparatus, or facilities owned or leased by the individual's employer and which is within
the limits of property owned or leased, and operated or maintained by the individual's employer,
shall not be required to maintain a contractor license as long as the employer has on file with
the commissioner a current certificate of responsible person. The certificate must be signed by the
responsible master plumber or, in an area of the state that is not a city or town with a population of
more than 5,000 according to the last federal census, restricted master plumber, and must state that
the person signing the certificate is responsible for ensuring that the maintenance and repair work
performed by the employer's employees comply with sections 326B.41 to 326B.49, all rules adopted
under those sections and sections 326B.50 to 326B.59, and all orders issued under section 326B.082.
The employer must pay a filing fee to file a certificate of responsible person with the commissioner.
The certificate shall expire two years from the date of filing. In order to maintain a current certificate
of responsible person, the employer must resubmit a certificate of responsible person, with a filing
fee, no later than two years from the date of the previous submittal. The filing of the certificate of
responsible person does not exempt any employee of the employer from the requirements of this
chapter regarding individual licensing as a plumber or registration as a plumber's apprentice.

    (c) If a contractor employs a licensed plumber, the licensed plumber does not need a separate
contractor license to perform plumbing work on behalf of the employer within the scope of the
licensed plumber's license.
    Subd. 1b. Employment of master plumber or restricted master plumber. (a) Each contractor
must designate a responsible licensed plumber, who shall be responsible for the performance
of all plumbing work in accordance with sections 326B.41 to 326B.49, all rules adopted under
these sections and sections 326B.50 to 326B.59, and all orders issued under section 326B.082.
A plumbing contractor's responsible licensed plumber must be a master plumber. A restricted
plumbing contractor's responsible licensed plumber must be a master plumber or a restricted master
plumber. A plumbing contractor license authorizes the contractor to offer to perform and, through
licensed and registered individuals, to perform plumbing work in all areas of the state. A restricted
plumbing contractor license authorizes the contractor to offer to perform and, through licensed and
registered individuals, to perform plumbing work in all areas of the state except in cities and towns
with a population of more than 5,000 according to the last federal census.
    (b) If the contractor is an individual or sole proprietorship, the responsible licensed plumber
must be the individual, proprietor, or managing employee. If the contractor is a partnership, the
responsible licensed plumber must be a general partner or managing employee. If the contractor is
a limited liability company, the responsible licensed plumber must be a chief manager or managing
employee. If the contractor is a corporation, the responsible licensed plumber must be an officer or
managing employee. If the responsible licensed plumber is a managing employee, the responsible
licensed plumber must be actively engaged in performing plumbing work on behalf of the contractor,
and cannot be employed in any capacity as a plumber for any other contractor. An individual may
be the responsible licensed plumber for only one contractor.
    (c) All applications and renewals for contractor licenses shall include a verified statement that
the applicant or licensee has complied with this subdivision.

condition of licensing, each contractor shall give and maintain bond to the state in the amount of at
least $25,000 for (1) all plumbing work entered into within the state or (2) all plumbing work and
subsurface sewage treatment work entered into within the state. If the bond is for both plumbing
work and subsurface sewage treatment work, the bond must comply with the requirements of this
section and section 115.56, subdivision 2, paragraph (e). The bond shall be for the benefit of persons
injured or suffering financial loss by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of the State
Plumbing Code and, if the bond is for both plumbing work and subsurface sewage treatment work,
financial loss by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of sections 115.55 and 115.56.
The bond shall be filed with the commissioner and shall be written by a corporate surety licensed
to do business in the state.

      Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.47, is amended to read:
      326B.47 PLUMBER'S APPRENTICES.
    Subdivision 1. Registration; supervision; records. (a) All plumber's apprentices must be
registered. To be a registered plumber's apprentice, an individual must either:
   (1) be an individual employed in the trade of plumbing under an apprenticeship agreement
approved by the department under Minnesota Rules, part 5200.0300; or
      (2) be an unlicensed individual registered with the commissioner under subdivision 3.
   (b) A plumber's apprentice is authorized to assist in the installation of plumbing only while
under the direct supervision of a master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted journeyman
plumber. The master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted journeyman plumber is

responsible for ensuring that all plumbing work performed by the plumber's apprentice complies
with the plumbing code. The supervising master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted
journeyman must be licensed and must be employed by the same employer as the plumber's
apprentice. Licensed individuals shall not permit plumber's apprentices to perform plumbing
work except under the direct supervision of an individual actually licensed to perform such work.
Plumber's apprentices shall not supervise the performance of plumbing work or make assignments
of plumbing work to unlicensed individuals.
    (c) Contractors employing plumber's apprentices to perform plumbing work shall maintain
records establishing compliance with this subdivision that shall identify all plumber's apprentices
performing plumbing work, and shall permit the department to examine and copy all such records.
    Subd. 2. Journeyman exam. A plumber's apprentice who has completed four years of practical
plumbing experience is eligible to take the journeyman plumbing examination. Up to 24 months
of practical plumbing experience prior to becoming a plumber's apprentice may be applied to the
four-year experience requirement. However, none of this practical plumbing experience may be
applied if the individual did not have any practical plumbing experience in the 12-month period
immediately prior to becoming a plumber's apprentice. The Plumbing Board may adopt rules to
evaluate whether the individual's past practical plumbing experience is applicable in preparing for
the journeyman's examination. If two years after completing the training the individual has not taken
the examination, the four years of experience shall be forfeited.
    The commissioner may allow an extension of the two-year period for taking the exam for cases
of hardship or other appropriate circumstances.
      Subd. 3. Registration, rules, applications, renewals, and fees. An unlicensed individual
may register by completing and submitting to the commissioner ­                                                       a­­­r­eg

    Subd. 4. Renewal; use period for license. (a) A restricted master plumber and restricted
journeyman plumber license must be renewed for as long as that licensee engages in the plumbing
trade. Notwithstanding section 326B.094, failure to renew a restricted master plumber and
restricted journeyman plumber license within 12 months after the expiration date will result in
permanent forfeiture of the restricted master plumber and restricted journeyman plumber license.
    (b) The commissioner shall in a manner determined by the commissioner, without the need for
any rulemaking under chapter 14, phase in the renewal of restricted master plumber and restricted
journeyman plumber licenses from one year to two years. By June 30, 2011, all restricted master
plumber and restricted journeyman plumber licenses shall be two-year licenses.

Code, and all orders issued under section 326B.082.

    Subd. 4. Plumber's apprentices. (a) A plumber's apprentice who is registered under section
326B.47 is authorized to assist in water conditioning installation and water conditioning servicing
only while under the direct supervision of a master plumber, journeyman plumber, water
conditioning master, or water conditioning journeyman. The master or journeyman is responsible

plumber's apprentice. Licensed individuals shall not permit plumber's apprentices to perform water
conditioning work except under the direct supervision of an individual actually licensed to perform
such work. Plumber's apprentices shall not supervise the performance of plumbing work or make
assignments of plumbing work to unlicensed individuals.
   (b) Water conditioning contractors employing plumber's apprentices to perform water
conditioning work shall maintain records establishing compliance with this subdivision that
shall identify all plumber's apprentices performing water conditioning work, and shall permit the
department to examine and copy all such records.

       Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.805, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
       Subd. 6. Exemptions. The license requirement does not apply to:
       (1) an employee of a licensee performing work for the licensee;
   (2) a material person, manufacturer, or retailer furnishing finished products, materials, or articles
of merchandise who does not install or attach the items;
    (3) an owner of residential real estate who builds or improves any structure on residential

improves property for purposes of speculation if the building or improving is performed by the
owner's bona fide employees or by individual owners personally. A residential building contractor
or residential remodeler will be presumed to be building or improving for purposes of speculation
if the contractor or remodeler constructs or improves more than one property within any 24-month
period;
   (4) an architect or professional engineer engaging in professional practice as defined by section
326.02, subdivisions 2 and 3;
  (5) a person whose total gross annual receipts for performing specialty skills for which licensure
would be required under this section do not exceed $15,000;
     (6) a mechanical contractor;
    (7) a plumber, electrician, or other person whose profession is otherwise subject to statewide
licensing, when engaged in the activity which is the subject of that licensure;
     (8) specialty contractors who provide only one special skill as defined in section 326B.802;
     (9) a school district, or a technical college governed under chapter 136F; and
   (10) Habitat for Humanity and Builders Outreach Foundation, and their individual volunteers
when engaged in activities on their behalf.
To qualify for the exemption in clause (5), a person must obtain a certificate of exemption from
licensure from the commissioner. A certificate of exemption will be issued upon the applicant's filing
with the commissioner, an affidavit stating that the applicant does not expect to exceed $15,000 in
gross annual receipts derived from performing services which require licensure under this section
during the calendar year in which the affidavit is received. For the purposes of calculating fees under
section 326B.092, a certificate of exemption is an entry level license. To renew the exemption in
clause (5), the applicant must file an affidavit stating that the applicant did not exceed $15,000 in
gross annual receipts during the past calendar year. If a person, operating under the exemption in
clause (5), exceeds $15,000 in gross receipts during any calendar year, the person must immediately

must remain licensed until such time as the person's gross annual receipts during a calendar year
fall below $15,000. The person may then apply for an exemption for the next calendar year.

It is recommended that the single-section used manufactured home being reinstalled follow the
instructions in the manufacturer's installation manual. By signing this notice, the purchaser(s) are
acknowledging they have elected to use footings placed above the local frost line in accordance with
the Minnesota State Building Code.
The seller has explained the differences between the manufacturer's installation instructions and
the installation system selected by the purchaser(s) with respect to possible effects of frost on the
manufactured home.
The purchaser(s) acknowledge by signing this notice that there is no manufacturer's original
warranty remaining on the home and recognize that any other extended or ancillary warranty could
be adversely affected if any applicable warranty stipulates that the home be installed in accordance
with the manufacturer's installation manual to remain effective.
After the reinstallation of the manufactured home, it is highly recommended that the purchaser(s)
have a licensed manufactured home installer recheck the home's installation for any releveling needs
or anchoring system adjustments each freeze-thaw cycle.
The purchaser(s) of the used manufactured home described below that is being reinstalled
acknowledge they have read this notice and have been advised to contact the manufacturer of the
home and/or the Department of Labor and Industry if they desire additional information before
signing this notice. It is the intent of this notice to inform the purchaser(s) that the purchaser(s)
elected not to use a frost-protected foundation system for the reinstallation of the manufactured
home as originally required by the home's installation manual.
     Plain language notice.
    I understand that because this home will be installed with footings placed above the local frost
line, this home may be subject to adverse effects from frost heave that may damage this home.

    I understand that the installation of this home with footings placed above the local frost line could

   Sec. 71. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 327B.04, subdivision 8, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 8. Limited dealer's license. The commissioner shall issue a limited dealer's license to an
owner of a manufactured home park authorizing the licensee as principal only to engage in the sale,
offering for sale, soliciting, or advertising the sale of used manufactured homes located in the owned
manufactured home park. The licensee must be the title holder of the homes and may engage in no
more than ten sales during each year of the two-year licensure period. An owner may, upon payment
of the applicable fee and compliance with this subdivision, obtain a separate license for each owned
manufactured home park and is entitled to sell up to 20 homes per license period provided that only
one limited dealer license may be issued for each park. The license shall be issued after:
    (1) receipt of an application on forms provided by the commissioner containing the following
information:
   (i) the identity of the applicant;
   (ii) the name under which the applicant will be licensed and do business in this state;
    (iii) the name and address of the owned manufactured home park, including a copy of the park
license, serving as the basis for the issuance of the license;
   (iv) the name, home, and business address of the applicant;
    (v) the name, address, and telephone number of one individual that is designated by the
applicant to receive all communications and cooperate with all inspections and investigations of
the commissioner pertaining to the sale of manufactured homes in the manufactured home park
owned by the applicant;
    (vi) whether the applicant or its designated individual has been convicted of a crime within the
previous ten years that is either related directly to the business for which the license is sought or
involved fraud, misrepresentation or misuse of funds, or has suffered a judgment in a civil action
involving fraud, misrepresentation, or conversion within the previous five years or has had any
government license or permit suspended or revoked as a result of an action brought by a federal or
state governmental agency in this or any other state within the last five years; and
   (vii) the applicant's qualifications and business history, including whether the applicant or its
designated individual has ever been adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or has any unsatisfied court
judgments outstanding against it or them;
   (2) payment of the license fee established by subdivision 7a; and
    (3) provision of a surety bond in the amount of $5,000. A separate surety bond must be provided
for each limited license.
    The applicant need not comply with section 327B.04, subdivision 4, paragraph (e). The
holding of a limited dealer's license does not satisfy the requirement contained in section 327B.04,
subdivision 4, paragraph (e), for the licensee or salespersons with respect to obtaining a dealer
license. The commissioner may, upon application for a renewal of a license, require only a
verification that copies of sales documents have been retained and payment of the renewal ­      f­

   Sec. 72. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 327B.041, is amended to read:
   327B.041 MANUFACTURED HOME INSTALLERS.
   (a) Manufactured home installers are subject to all of the fees in section 326B.092 and the
requirements of sections 326B.802 to 326B.885, except for the following:
    (1) manufactured home installers are not subject to the continuing education requirements of
section 326B.821, but are subject to the continuing education requirements established in rules
adopted under section 327B.10;
    (2) the examination requirement of section 326B.83, subdivision 3, for manufactured home
installers shall be satisfied by successful completion of a written examination administered and
developed specifically for the examination of manufactured home installers. The examination must
be administered and developed by the commissioner. The commissioner and the state building
official shall seek advice on the grading, monitoring, and updating of examinations from the
Minnesota Manufactured Housing Association;
   (3) a local government unit may not place a surcharge on a license fee, and may not charge a
separate fee to installers;
    (4) a dealer or distributor who does not install or repair manufactured homes is exempt from
licensure under sections 326B.802 to 326B.885;
   (5) the exemption under section 326B.805, subdivision 6, clause (5), does not apply; and
   (6) manufactured home installers are not subject to the contractor recovery fund in section
326B.89.
    (b) The commissioner may waive all or part of the requirements for licensure as a manufactured
home installer for any individual who holds an unexpired license or certificate issued by any other
state or other United States jurisdiction if the licensing requirements of that jurisdiction meet or
exceed the corresponding licensing requirements of the department and the individual complies
with section 326B.092, subdivisions 1 and 3 to 7. For the purposes of calculating fees under section
326B.092, licensure as a manufactured home installer is a business license.
   Sec. 73. WATER-FREE URINALS.
    The Plumbing Board shall have expedited rulemaking authority provided under section 14.389
for expedited rules regarding water-free urinals that meet the Minnesota Plumbing Board standards.
This authority expires December 31, 2010.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 58.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Residential mortgage originators. (a) An applicant for a residential mortgage
originator license must file with the department a surety bond in the amount of $100,000, issued
by an insurance company authorized to do so in this state. The bond must cover all mortgage loan
originators who are employees or independent agents of the applicant. The bond must be available
for the recovery of expenses, fines, and fees levied by the commissioner under this chapter and for
losses incurred by borrowers as a result of a licensee's noncompliance with the requirements of
this chapter, sections 325D.43 to 325D.48, and 325F.67 to 325F.69, or breach of contract relating
to activities regulated by this chapter.
   (b) The bond must be submitted with the originator's license application and evidence of
continued coverage must be submitted with each renewal. Any change in the bond must be
submitted for approval by the commissioner, within ten days of its execution. The bond or a
substitute bond shall remain in effect during all periods of licensing.
    (c) Upon filing of the mortgage call report as required by section 58A.17, a licensee shall
maintain or increase its surety bond to reflect the total dollar amount of the closed residential
mortgage loans originated in this state in the preceding year according to the table in this paragraph.
A licensee may decrease its surety bond according to the table in this paragraph if the surety bond
required is less than the amount of the surety bond on file with the department.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2695 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 2695 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.5561, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Reports required. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a person mandated
to report under section 626.556, subdivision 3, shall immediately report to the local welfare
agency if the person knows or has reason to believe that a woman is pregnant and has used a
controlled substance for a nonmedical purpose during the pregnancy, including, but not limited to,
tetrahydrocannabinol, or has consumed alcoholic beverages during the pregnancy in any way that
is habitual or excessive.
    (b) A health care professional or a social service professional who is mandated to report under
section 626.556, subdivision 3, is exempt from reporting under paragraph (a) a woman's use or
consumption of tetrahydrocannabinol or alcoholic beverages during pregnancy if the professional
is providing the woman with prenatal care or other healthcare services.
    (c) Any person may make a voluntary report if the person knows or has reason to believe
that a woman is pregnant and has used a controlled substance for a nonmedical purpose during
the pregnancy, including, but not limited to, tetrahydrocannabinol, or has consumed alcoholic
beverages during the pregnancy in any way that is habitual or excessive. An oral report shall be
made immediately by telephone or otherwise. An oral report made by a person required to report
shall be followed within 72 hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays, by a report in writing to
the local welfare agency. Any report shall be of sufficient content to identify the pregnant woman,
the nature and extent of the use, if known, and the name and address of the reporter.
   (d) For purposes of this section, "prenatal care" means the comprehensive package of medical
and psychological support provided throughout the pregnancy."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

DECISION MAKERS.
    State employees in the classified service are expected to provide objective information in a
timely manner to both executive and legislative decision makers. State employees shall provide
assistance to legislative decision makers in a manner that is consistent with the need to perform the
employees' other duties. A classified state employee shall make a good-faith effort to maintain the
confidentiality of budget or policy discussions with a member of the legislature or the member's staff
person, unless otherwise directed by that member or staff person. This section does not authorize or
require an employee to disclose data otherwise protected by law.

    Subdivision 1. Prohibited action. An employer shall not discharge, discipline, threaten,
otherwise discriminate against, or penalize an employee regarding the employee's compensation,
terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because:
    (1) the employee, or a person acting on behalf of an employee, in good faith, reports a violation
or suspected violation of any federal or state law or rule adopted pursuant to law to an employer or
to any governmental body or law enforcement official;
   (2) the employee is requested by a public body or office to participate in an investigation, hearing,
inquiry;
    (3) the employee refuses an employer's order to perform an action that the employee has an
objective basis in fact to believe violates any state or federal law or rule or regulation adopted
pursuant to law, and the employee informs the employer that the order is being refused for that
reason;
    (4) the employee, in good faith, reports a situation in which the quality of health care services
provided by a health care facility, organization, or health care provider violates a standard
established by federal or state law or a professionally recognized national clinical or ethical
standard and potentially places the public at risk of harm; ­
                                                            o­r
   (5) a public employee communicates the findings of a scientific or technical study that the
employee, in good faith, believes to be truthful and accurate, including reports to a governmental
body or law enforcement official.
                                ­; or
    (6) an employee in the classified service of state government communicates information that
the employee, in good faith, believes to be truthful and accurate, and that relates to state services,
including the financing of state services to:
   (i) a legislator or the legislative auditor; or
   (ii) a constitutional officer.
The disclosures protected pursuant to this section do not authorize the disclosure of data otherwise
protected by law.
