     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.021, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Determining applicable law. An annuity under this chapter must be computed under
the law in effect as of the last day for which the employee receives pay, or if on medical leave, the day
that the leave terminates. However, if the employee has returned to covered employment following a
termination, the employee must have earned at least six months of allowable service following their
return in order to qualify for improved benefits resulting from any law change enacted subsequent
to that termination.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

other amounts authorized by law must be deposited.

annuity from the Minnesota State Retirement System if the employee:
    (1) is not an active employee of the Transit Operating Division of the former Metropolitan
Transit Commission on July 1, 1978; (2) has at least ten years of active continuous service with the
Transit Operating Division of the former Metropolitan Transit Commission as defined by the former
Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit Operating Division employees retirement plan document
in effect on December 31, 1977; (3) has not received a refund of contributions; (4) has not retired
or begun receiving an annuity or benefit from the former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund; (5) is at least 55 years old; and (6) submits a valid
application for a retirement annuity to the executive director of the Minnesota State Retirement
System.
    The person is entitled to a retirement annuity in an amount equal to the normal old age
retirement allowance calculated under the former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document in effect on December 31, 1977,
subject to an early retirement reduction or adjustment in amount on account of retirement before
the normal retirement age specified in that former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document.
     The deferred retirement annuity of any person to whom this subdivision applies must be
augmented. The required reserves applicable to the deferred retirement annuity, determined as
of the date the allowance begins to accrue using an appropriate mortality table and an interest
assumption of five percent, must be augmented by interest at the rate of five percent per year
compounded annually from January 1, 1978, to January 1, 1981, and three percent per year
compounded annually from January 1, 1981, to the first day of the month in which the annuity
begins to accrue. U   ­p ­o

   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.31, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1b. Joint and survivor option. (a) Prior to payment of a surviving spouse benefit under
subdivision 1, the surviving spouse may elect to receive the 100 percent joint and survivor optional
annuity under section 353.32, subdivision 1a, rather than a surviving spouse benefit.
    (b) If there is a dependent child or children, and the 100 percent joint and survivor optional
annuity for the surviving spouse, when added to the dependent children's benefit under subdivisions
1 and 1a, exceeds an amount equal to 70 percent of the member's specified average monthly salary,
the 100 percent joint and survivor annuity under section 353.32, subdivision 1a, must be reduced
by the amount necessary so that the total family benefit does not exceed the 70 percent maximum
family benefit amount under subdivision 1a.
    (c) The 100 percent joint and survivor optional annuity must be restored to the surviving spouse,

through January 1, 2009, and thereafter under section 356.415, as the dependent child or children
become no longer dependent under section 353.01, subdivision 15.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.31, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Postretirement adjustment eligibility. A survivor benefit under subdivision 1 or 1b
or section 353.32, subdivision 1a, 1b, or 1c is eligible for postretirement adjustments under section
356.415.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.33, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Optional annuity election. A disabled member may elect to receive the normal
disability benefit or an optional annuity under section 353.30, subdivision 3. The election of an
optional annuity must be made prior to the commencement of payment of the disability benefit.
The optional annuity must begin to accrue on the same date as provided for the disability benefit.
    (1) If a person who is not the spouse of a member is named as beneficiary of the joint and
survivor optional annuity, the person is eligible to receive the annuity only if the spouse, on the
disability application form prescribed by the executive director, permanently waives the surviving
spouse benefits under sections 353.31, subdivision 1, and 353.32, subdivision 1a. If the spouse of
the member refuses to permanently waive the surviving spouse coverage, the selection of a person
other than the spouse of the member as a joint annuitant is invalid.
    (2) If the spouse of the member permanently waives survivor coverage, the dependent children,
if any, continue to be eligible for survivor benefits under section 353.31, subdivision 1, including
the minimum benefit in section 353.31, subdivision 1a. The designated optional annuity beneficiary
may draw the monthly benefit; however, the amount payable to the dependent child or children
and joint annuitant must not exceed the 70 percent maximum family benefit under section 353.31,
subdivision 1a. If the maximum is exceeded, the benefit of the joint annuitant must be reduced to the
amount necessary so that the total family benefit does not exceed the 70 percent maximum family
benefit amount.
    (3) If the spouse is named as the beneficiary of the joint and survivor optional annuity, the spouse
may draw the monthly benefits; however, the amount payable to the dependent child or children and
the joint annuitant must not exceed the 70 percent maximum family benefit under section 353.31,
subdivision 1a. If the maximum is exceeded, each dependent child will receive ten percent of the

member's specified average monthly salary, and the benefit to the joint annuitant must be reduced
to the amount necessary so that the total family benefit does not exceed the 70 percent maximum
family benefit amount. The joint and survivor optional annuity must be restored to the surviving
spouse, plus applicable postretirement adjustments under Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.41
or section 356.415, as the dependent child or children become no longer dependent under section
353.01, subdivision 15.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.33, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Partial reemployment. If, following a work or non-work-related injury or illness,
a disabled person who remains totally and permanently disabled as defined in section 353.01,
subdivision 19, has income from employment that is not substantial gainful activity and the rate of
earnings from that employment are less than the salary rate at the date of disability or the salary
rate currently paid for positions similar to the employment position held by the disabled person
immediately before becoming disabled, whichever is greater, the executive director shall continue
the disability benefit in an amount that, when added to the earnings and any workers' compensation
benefit, does not exceed the salary rate at the date of disability or the salary currently paid for
positions similar to the employment position held by the disabled person immediately before
becoming disabled, whichever is higher. The disability benefit under this subdivision may not
exceed the disability benefit originally allowed, plus any postretirement adjustments payable after
December 31, 1988, in accordance with Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 11A.18, subdivision 10,
or Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.41, through January 1, 2009, and thereafter as provided in
section 356.415. No deductions for the retirement fund may be taken from the salary of a disabled
person who is receiving a disability benefit as provided in this subdivision.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.33, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 13. Postretirement adjustment eligibility. A disability benefit under this section is
eligible for postretirement adjustments under section 356.415.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.651, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Postretirement adjustment eligibility. An annuity under this section is eligible for
postretirement adjustments under section 356.415.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.656, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Cessation of disability benefit. (a) The association shall cease the payment of any
disability benefit the first of the month following the reinstatement of a member to full time or less
than full-time service in a position covered by the police and fire fund.
   (b) A disability benefit paid to a disabled member of the police and fire plan, that was granted
under laws in effect after June 30, 2007, terminates at the end of the month in which the member:
   (1) reaches normal retirement age;
   (2) if the disability benefit is payable for a 60-month period as determined under subdivisions 1
and 3, as applicable, the first of the month following the expiration of the 60-month period; or
   (3) if the disabled member so chooses, the end of the month in which the member has elected to
convert to an early retirement annuity under section 353.651, subdivision 4.

    (c) If the police and fire plan member continues to be disabled when the disability benefit
terminates under this subdivision, the member is deemed to be retired. The individual is entitled
to receive a normal retirement annuity or an early retirement annuity under section 353.651,
whichever is applicable, as further specified in paragraph (d) or (e). If the individual did not
previously elect an optional annuity under subdivision 1a, paragraph (a), the individual may elect
an optional annuity under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b).
    (d) A member of the police and fire plan who is receiving a disability benefit under this
section may, upon application, elect to receive an early retirement annuity under section 353.651,
subdivision 4, at any time after attaining age 50, but must convert to a retirement annuity no later
than the end of the month in which the disabled member attains normal retirement age. An early
retirement annuity elected under this subdivision must be calculated on the disabled member's
accrued years of service and average salary as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 17a, and
when elected, the member is deemed to be retired.
   (e) When an individual's benefit is recalculated as a retirement annuity under this section, the
annuity must be based on clause (1) or clause (2), whichever provides the greater amount:
    (1) the benefit amount at the time of reclassification, including all prior adjustments provided
under Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 11A.18, through January 1, 2009, and thereafter as provided
in section 356.415; or
   (2) a benefit amount computed on the member's actual years of accrued allowable service credit
and the law in effect at the time the disability benefit first accrued, plus any increases that would
have applied since that date under section Minnesota Statutes 2008, 11A.18, through January 1,
2009, and thereafter as provided in section 356.415.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.656, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Postretirement adjustment eligibility. A disability benefit under this section is
eligible for postretirement adjustments under section 356.415.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.657, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Maximum and minimum family benefits. (a) The maximum monthly benefit per
family must not exceed the following percentages of the member's average monthly salary as
specified in subdivision 3:
   (1) 80 percent, if the member's death was a line of duty death; or
   (2) 70 percent, if the member's death was not a line of duty death or occurred while the member
was receiving a disability benefit that accrued before July 1, 2007.
   (b) The minimum monthly benefit per family, including the joint and survivor optional annuity
under subdivision 2a, and section 353.656, subdivision 1a, must not be less than the following
percentage of the member's average monthly salary as specified in subdivision 3:

    (c) If the maximum under paragraph (a) is exceeded, the monthly benefit of the joint annuitant
must be reduced to the amount necessary so that the total family benefit does not exceed the
applicable maximum. The joint and survivor optional annuity must be restored, plus applicable
postretirement adjustments under Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.41 or section 356.415, as
the dependent child or children become no longer dependent under section 353.01, subdivision 15.
     Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.657, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Postretirement adjustment eligibility. A survivor benefit under this section is eligible
for postretirement adjustments under section 356.415.
     Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.665, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Transfer of assets. Unless the municipality has elected to retain the consolidation
account under subdivision 1, paragraph (b), the assets of the former local police or fire consolidation
account must be transferred and upon transfer, the actuarial value of the assets of a former local
police or fire consolidation account less an amount equal to the residual assets as determined under
subdivision 7, paragraph (f), are the assets of the public employees police and fire fund as of July
1, 1999. T   ­h

other item of value which is determined to be ineligible or inappropriate for retention by the state
board. The liquidation shall occur before the effective date of consolidation and transfer of assets.
  (c) If requested to do so by the chief administrative officer of the relief association or of the
municipality, the state board shall provide advice on the means and procedures available to liquidate

of benefit coverage provided by the public employees police and fire fund under section 353A.08,
and any direct administrative expenses related to the consolidation account, and the proportional
share of the general administrative expenses of the association.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided for in this section, the liabilities and the assets of a
consolidation account must be considered for all purposes to be separate from the balance of the
public employees police and fire fund. The consolidation account must be subject to separate
accounting, a separate actuarial valuation, and must be reported as a separate exhibit in any annual
financial report or actuarial valuation report of the public employees police and fire consolidation
fund, whichever applies. The executive director of the public employees retirement association
shall maintain separate accounting records and balances for each consolidation account.
    Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353A.10, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Collection of late contributions. In the event of a refusal by a municipality in which
was located a local police or firefighters relief association which has consolidated with the fund
to pay to the fund any amount or amounts due under section 353A.09, subdivisions ­        2 4 to 6,
the executive director of the public employees retirement association may notify the Department
of Revenue, the Department of Finance, and the state auditor of the refusal and commence the
necessary procedure to collect the amount or amounts due from the amount of any state aid
under sections 69.011 to 69.051, amortization state aid under section 423A.02, or supplemental
amortization state aid under Laws 1984, chapter 564, section 48, as amended by Laws 1986,
chapter 359, section 20, which is payable to the municipality or to certify the amount or amounts
due to the county auditor for inclusion in the next tax levy of the municipality or for collection
from other revenue available to the municipality, or both.
    Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353A.10, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Levy and bonding authority. A municipality in which was located a local police or
firefighters relief association that has consolidated with the fund may issue general obligation bonds
of the municipality to defray all or a portion of the principal amounts specified in section 353A.09,
subdivisions ­ 2 4 to 6, or certify to the county auditor a levy in the amount necessary to defray all or
a portion of the principal amount specified in section 353A.09, subdivisions 2    ­ 4 to 6, or the annual
amount specified in section 353A.09, subdivisions 2     ­ 4 to 6. The municipality may pledge the full
faith, credit, and taxing power of the municipality for the payment of the principal of and interest on
the general obligation bonds. Any municipal bond may be issued without an election under section
475.58 and may not be included in the net debt of the municipality for purposes of any charter
or statutory debt limitation, nor may any tax levy for the payment of bond principal or interest be
subject to any limitation concerning rate or amount established by charter or law.

    Sec. 68. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.70, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Transfer of assets. (a) On or before June 30, 2006, the chief administrative officer of
the Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association shall transfer to the Teachers Retirement
Association the entire assets of the special retirement fund of the Minneapolis Teachers Retirement
Fund Association. The transfer of the assets of the Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
Association special retirement fund must include any accounts receivable that are determined by
the executive director of the State Board of Investment as reasonably capable of being collected.
Legal title to account receivables that are determined by the executive director of the State Board
of Investment as not reasonably capable of being collected transfers to Special School District No.
1, Minneapolis, as of the date of the determination of the executive director of the State Board of
Investment. If the account receivables transferred to Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis,
are subsequently recovered by the school district, the superintendent of Special School District
No. 1, Minneapolis, shall transfer the recovered amount to the executive director of the Teachers
Retirement Association, in cash, for deposit in the teachers retirement fund, less the reasonable
expenses of the school district related to the recovery.
    (b) As of June 30, 2006, assets of the special retirement fund of the Minneapolis Teachers
Retirement Fund Association are assets of the Teachers Retirement Association to be invested by
the State Board of Investment pursuant to the provisions of section 354.07, subdivision 4. The
Teachers Retirement Association is the successor in interest to all claims which the Minneapolis
Teachers Retirement Fund Association may have or may assert against any person and is the
successor in interest to all claims which could have been asserted against the former Minneapolis
Teachers Retirement Fund Association, subject to the following exceptions and qualifications:
    (1) the Teachers Retirement Association is not liable for any claim against the Minneapolis
Teachers Retirement Fund Association, its former board or board members, which is founded upon
a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, where the act or acts constituting the claimed breach were not
done in good faith;
   (2) the Teachers Retirement Association may assert any applicable defense to any claim in
any judicial or administrative proceeding that the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
1804                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [33RD DAY

Association or its board would otherwise have been entitled to assert;
   (3) the Teachers Retirement Association may assert any applicable defense that the Teachers
Retirement Association may assert in its capacity as a statewide agency; and
   (4) the Teachers Retirement Association shall indemnify any former fiduciary of the
Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association consistent with the provisions of the Public
Pension Fiduciary Responsibility Act, in section 356A.11.
    (c) From the assets of the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association
transferred to the Teachers Retirement Association, an amount equal to the percentage figure
that represents the ratio between the market value of the Minnesota postretirement investment
fund as of June 30, 2006, and the required reserves of the Minnesota postretirement investment
fund as of June 30, 2006, applied to the present value of future benefits payable to annuitants of
the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association as of June 30, 2006, including
any postretirement adjustment from the Minnesota postretirement investment fund expected to
be payable on January 1, 2007, must be transferred to the Minnesota postretirement investment
fund. The executive director of the State Board of Investment shall estimate this ratio at the
time of the transfer. By January 1, 2007, after all necessary financial information becomes
available to determine the actual funded ratio of the Minnesota postretirement investment fund,
the postretirement investment fund must refund to the Teachers Retirement Association any excess
assets or the Teachers Retirement Association must contribute any deficiency to the Minnesota
postretirement investment fund with interest under Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 11A.18,
subdivision 6. The balance of the assets of the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
Association after the transfer to the Minnesota postretirement investment fund must be credited
to the Teachers Retirement Association.
    (d) If the assets transferred by the Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association to
the Teachers Retirement Association are insufficient to meet its obligation to the Minnesota
postretirement investment fund, additional assets must be transferred by the executive director of
the Teachers Retirement Association to meet the amount required.
   Sec. 69. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.70, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Benefit calculation. (a) For every deferred, inactive, disabled, and retired member
of the Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association transferred under subdivision 1, and
the survivors of these members, annuities or benefits earned before the date of the transfer, other
than future postretirement adjustments, must be calculated and paid by the Teachers Retirement
Association under the laws, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of the former Minneapolis
Teachers Retirement Fund Association that were in effect relative to the person on the date of the
person's termination of active service covered by the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement
Fund Association.
    (b) Former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association members who retired before
July 1, 2006, must receive postretirement adjustments after December 31, 2006, only as provided
in Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 11A.18 or section 356.415. All other benefit recipients of the
former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association must receive postretirement adjustments
after December 31, 2006, only as provided in section ­

    (b) "Actuarial valuation" means a set of calculations prepared by an actuary retained under
section 356.214 if so required under section 3.85, or otherwise, by an approved actuary, to
determine the normal cost and the accrued actuarial liabilities of a benefit plan, according to the
entry age actuarial cost method and based upon stated assumptions including, but not limited to
rates of interest, mortality, salary increase, disability, withdrawal, and retirement and to determine
the payment necessary to amortize over a stated period any unfunded accrued actuarial liability
disclosed as a result of the actuarial valuation of the benefit plan.

plan is governed by any other law, between the entry age and the assumed exit age, with the portion
of the actuarial present value which is allocated to the valuation year to be the normal cost and the
portion of the actuarial present value not provided for at the valuation date by the actuarial present
value of future normal costs to be the actuarial accrued liability, with aggregation in the calculation
process to be the sum of the calculated result for each covered individual and with recognition given
to any different benefit formulas which may apply to various periods of service.
   (e) "Experience study" means a report providing experience data and an actuarial analysis of the

    (iv) 80 percent of the difference between the actual net change in the market value of total assets
between June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2011, and the computed increase in the market value of total

increased at 8.5 percent annually.
    (5) For the July 1, 2013, and following actuarial valuations, the market value of all assets as of
the preceding June 30, reduced by:
    (i) 20 percent of the difference between the actual net change in the market value of total assets
between the June 30 that occurred three years earlier and the June 30 that occurred four years earlier

assets had earned a rate of return on assets equal to the annual percentage preretirement interest rate
assumption used in the actuarial valuation for the July 1 that occurred three years earlier;
    (iii) 60 percent of the difference between the actual net change in the market value of total assets

    (iv) 80 percent of the difference between the actual net change in the market value of total assets
between the most recent June 30 and the June 30 that occurred one year earlier and the computed
increase in the market value of total assets over that fiscal year period if the assets had earned a rate
of return on assets equal to the annual percentage preretirement interest rate assumption used in the
actuarial valuation for the July 1 that occurred one year earlier.
    (g) "Unfunded actuarial accrued liability" means the total current and expected future benefit
obligations, reduced by the sum of the actuarial value of assets and the present value of future normal
costs.
    (h) "Pension benefit obligation" means the actuarial present value of credited projected benefits,
determined as the actuarial present value of benefits estimated to be payable in the future as a result
of employee service attributing an equal benefit amount, including the effect of projected salary
increases and any step rate benefit accrual rate differences, to each year of credited and expected
future employee service.
   Sec. 71. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.215, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must contain an exhibit for financial reporting
purposes indicating the additional annual contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability and must contain an exhibit for contribution determination purposes indicating
the additional contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For the
retirement plans listed in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), the additional contribution must be calculated
on a level percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full funding in effect when
the valuation is prepared, assuming annual payroll growth at the applicable percentage rate set forth
in subdivision 8, paragraph (c). For all other retirement plans, the additional annual contribution
must be calculated on a level annual dollar amount basis.
    (b) For any retirement plan other than the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the
general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, and the
St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, if there has not been a change in the actuarial
assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit
plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method
used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination
of the three, which change or changes by itself or by themselves without inclusion of any other
items of increase or decrease produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of
the fund, the established date for full funding is the first actuarial valuation date occurring after
June 1, 2020.
    (c) For any retirement plan other than the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund and the
general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, if there has
been a change in any or all of the actuarial assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued
liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the
fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all
or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the three, and the change or changes, by itself or by
themselves and without inclusion of any other items of increase or decrease, produce a net increase
in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the fund, the established date for full funding must be

determined using the following procedure:
   (i) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with the
plan provisions governing annuities and retirement benefits and the actuarial assumptions in effect
before an applicable change;
    (ii) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed
to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined under item (i) by the
established date for full funding in effect before the change must be calculated using the interest
assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;
    (iii) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with
any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
   (d) For the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the established date for full funding is
June 30, 2020.
    (e) For the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association,
the established date for full funding is June 30, 2031.
   (f) For the Teachers Retirement Association, the established date for full funding is June 30,
2037.
   (g) For the correctional state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement
System, the established date for full funding is June 30, 2038.

       (h) For the judges retirement plan, the established date for full funding is June 30, 2038.
    (i) For the public employees police and fire retirement plan, the established date for full funding
is June 30, 2038.
    (j) For the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the established date for full funding
is June 30 of the 25th year from the valuation date. In addition to other requirements of this chapter,
the annual actuarial valuation shall contain an exhibit indicating the funded ratio and the deficiency
or sufficiency in annual contributions when comparing liabilities to the market value of the assets
of the fund as of the close of the most recent fiscal year.
    (k) For the retirement plans for which the annual actuarial valuation indicates an excess of
valuation assets over the actuarial accrued liability, the valuation assets in excess of the actuarial
accrued liability must be recognized as a reduction in the current contribution requirements by an
amount equal to the amortization of the excess expressed as a level percentage of pay over a 30-year
period beginning anew with each annual actuarial valuation of the plan.

clause (3) for the initial retirement incentive applicable to that employing entity under Laws 2007,
chapter 134, after May 26, 2007, for deposit in the employee's account in the health care savings
plan established by section 352.98;
    (2) notwithstanding section 352.01, subdivision 11, or 354.05, subdivision 13, whichever
applies, if the appointing authority has designated the use under this clause for the initial retirement
incentive applicable to that employing entity under Laws 2007, chapter 134, after May 26, 2007,
for purchase of service credit for unperformed service sufficient to enable the employee to retire

or 354A.31, subdivision 6, paragraph (b), whichever applies; or
    (3) if the appointing authority has designated the use under this clause for the initial retirement
incentive applicable to the employing entity under Laws 2007, chapter 134, after May 26, 2007,
for purchase of a lifetime annuity or an annuity for a specific number of years from the applicable

respect to any other employing entity. An employee is eligible for the payment under paragraph (a),
clause (2), if the employee uses money from a deferred compensation account that, combined with

354.44, subdivision 6, paragraph (b), or 354A.31, subdivision 6, paragraph (b), whichever applies.
   (c) The cost to purchase service credit under paragraph (a), clause (2), must be made in

PLANS.
    Subdivision 1. Annual postretirement adjustments. (a) Retirement annuity, disability benefit,
or survivor benefit recipients of a covered retirement plan are entitled to a postretirement adjustment
annually on January 1, as follows:
    (1) a postretirement increase of 2.5 percent must be applied each year, effective January 1, to the
monthly annuity or benefit of each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity
or a benefit for at least 12 full months prior to the January 1 increase; and
    (2) for each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or a benefit for at
least one full month, an annual postretirement increase of 1/12 of 2.5 percent for each month the
person has been receiving an annuity or benefit must be applied, effective January 1 following the
year in which the person has been retired for less than 12 months.
    (b) The increases provided by this section commence on January 1, 2010.
   (c) An increase in annuity or benefit payments under this section must be made automatically
unless written notice is filed by the annuitant or benefit recipient with the executive director of the
covered retirement plan requesting that the increase not be made.
    (d) The retirement annuity payable to a person who retires before becoming eligible for
Social Security benefits and who has elected the optional payment as provided in section 353.29,
subdivision 6, or 354.35 must be treated as the sum of a period certain retirement annuity and
a life retirement annuity for the purposes of any postretirement adjustment. The period certain
retirement annuity plus the life retirement annuity must be the annuity amount payable until age
62 for section 353.29, subdivision 6, or age 62, 65, or normal retirement age, as selected by the
member at retirement, for an annuity amount payable under section 354.35. A postretirement
adjustment granted on the period certain retirement annuity must terminate when the period certain
retirement annuity terminates.

contested case be initiated before the Office of Administrative Hearings, the cost of which must be
borne by the peace officer or firefighter and the employer; and
   (3) a statement that any person who does not petition for a review within 60 days is precluded
from contesting issues determined by the executive director in any other administrative review or
court procedure.
If, prior to the contested case hearing, additional information is provided to support the claim for
duty disability as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 41, or 352B.011, subdivision 7, whichever
applies, the executive director may reverse the determination without the requested hearing. If a
hearing is held before the Office of Administrative Hearings, the determination rendered by the judge
conducting the fact-finding hearing is a final decision and order under section 14.62, subdivision 2a,
and is binding on the applicable executive director, the peace officer or firefighter, employer, and
state. Review of a final determination made by the Office of Administrative Hearings under this
section may only be obtained by writ of certiorari to the Minnesota Court of Appeals under sections
14.63 to 14.68. Only the peace officer or firefighter, employer, and state have standing to participate
in a judicial review of the decision of the Office of Administrative Hearings.
   (c) The officer's or firefighter's employer shall continue to provide health coverage for:
   (1) the officer or firefighter; and
   (2) the officer's or firefighter's dependents if the officer or firefighter was receiving dependent
coverage at the time of the injury under the employer's group health plan.
   (d) The employer is responsible for the continued payment of the employer's contribution for
coverage of the officer or firefighter and, if applicable, the officer's or firefighter's dependents.
Coverage must continue for the officer or firefighter and, if applicable, the officer's or firefighter's
dependents until the officer or firefighter reaches or, if deceased, would have reached the age of 65.
However, coverage for dependents does not have to be continued after the person is no longer a
dependent.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and also applies
to any member of the State Patrol retirement plan who was awarded a duty disability benefit on or
after July 1, 2008.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17e. Less frequent duties. "Less frequent duties" means tasks designated in the applicant's

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.113, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Medical or psychological examinations; authorization for payment of benefit. (a)
An applicant shall provide medical, chiropractic, or psychological evidence to support an application
for total and permanent disability.
    (b) The director shall have the employee examined by at least one additional licensed
chiropractor, physician, or psychologist designated by the medical adviser. The chiropractors,
physicians, or psychologists shall make written reports to the director concerning the employee's
disability including expert opinions as to whether the employee is permanently and totally disabled
within the meaning of section 352.01, subdivision 17.
    (c) The director shall also obtain written certification from the employer stating whether the
employment has ceased or whether the employee is on sick leave of absence because of a disability
that will prevent further service to the employer and as a consequence the employee is not entitled
to compensation from the employer.
    (d) The medical adviser shall consider the reports of the physicians, psychologists, and
chiropractors and any other evidence supplied by the employee or other interested parties. If
the medical adviser finds the employee totally and permanently disabled, the adviser shall make
appropriate recommendation to the director in writing together with the date from which the
employee has been totally disabled. The director shall then determine if the disability occurred

               y­s 18 months of filing the application, while still in the employment of the state, and

termination as long as the disability occurred while in the employment of the state. The fact that
an employee is placed on leave of absence without compensation because of disability does not bar
that employee from receiving a disability benefit.
    (f) Unless the payment of a disability benefit has terminated because the employee is no longer
totally disabled, or because the employee has reached normal retirement age as provided in this
section, the disability benefit must cease with the last payment received by the disabled employee
or which had accrued during the lifetime of the employee unless there is a spouse surviving. In that
event, the surviving spouse is entitled to the disability benefit for the calendar month in which the
disabled employee died.

1b and 1c, on the differential salary amount for the period of the leave of absence. The employing
department, at its option, may pay the employer amount on behalf of the member. Payment made

under this subdivision must include interest at the rate of 8.5 percent per year, and must be completed
within one year of the member's return from the leave of absence.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 18. [352B.086] SERVICE CREDIT FOR UNIFORMED SERVICE.
    (a) A member who is absent from employment by reason of service in the uniformed services, as
defined in United States Code, title 38, section 4303(13), and who returns to state employment in a
position covered by the plan upon discharge from service in the uniformed services within the time
frame required in United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), may obtain service credit for the
period of the uniformed service, provided that the member did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions.
    (b) The member may obtain credit by paying into the fund an equivalent member contribution
based on the member contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was
performed multiplied by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied to the annual
salary rate. The annual salary rate is the average annual salary during the purchase period that the
member would have received if the member had continued to provide employment services to the
state rather than to provide uniformed service, or if the determination of that rate is not reasonably
certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate during the 12-month period of
covered employment rendered immediately preceding the purchase period.
    (c) The equivalent employer contribution and, if applicable, the equivalent employer additional
contribution, must be paid by the employing unit, using the employer and employer additional
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied
to the same annual salary rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution.
    (d) If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this subdivision are not paid in full,
the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional number
of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the total member
contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this subdivision.
    (e) To receive allowable service credit under this subdivision, the contributions specified in this
section must be transmitted to the fund during the period which begins with the date on which the
individual returns to state employment covered by the plan and which has a duration of three times
the length of the uniformed service period, but not to exceed five years. If the determined payment
period is calculated to be less than one year, the contributions required under this subdivision to
receive service credit may be within one year from the discharge date.
   (f) The amount of allowable service credit obtainable under this section may not exceed five
years, unless a longer purchase period is required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312.
   (g) The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and employer contribution
amounts payable under this section. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5 percent compounded
annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or break in service to the end of the month in
which payment is received.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary and contributions were made,  ­ at the applicable rates under section 353.27,
353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service covered by payments in lieu of salary deductions under ­
                                                                                 s­ t­o
                                                                                   c­i
                                                                                  e­   ­­
                                                                                        n sections
353.27, subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   ­
   (2
    ­­) (3) service in years during which the public employee was not a member but for which the
member later elected, while a member, to obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted
by any law then in effect;
   ­
   (3
    ­­) (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made, deposited, and credited to the fund;
    ­
    (4
     ­­) (5) a period of authorized personal, parental, or medical leave of absence without pay,
including a leave of absence covered under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not
exceed one year, and for which a member obtained service credit for each month in the leave
period by payment under section 353.0161 to the fund made in place of salary deductions. An
employee must return to public service and render a minimum of three months of allowable service
in order to be eligible to make payment under section 353.0161 for a subsequent authorized leave
of absence without pay. Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for
the purchased period;
    ­
    (­
     5­) (6) a periodic, repetitive leave that is offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision.
The leave program may not exceed 208 hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the
association by the employer. A participating member obtains service credit by making employee
contributions in an amount or amounts based on the member's average salary that would have been
paid if the leave had not been taken. The employer shall pay the employer and additional employer
contributions on behalf of the participating member. The employee and the employer are responsible
to pay interest on their respective shares at the rate of 8.5 percent a year, compounded annually, from
the end of the normal cycle until full payment is made. An employer shall also make the employer
and additional employer contributions, plus 8.5 percent interest, compounded annually, on behalf
of an employee who makes employee contributions but terminates public service. The employee
contributions must be made within one year after the end of the annual normal working cycle or
within ­ 20
          ­ 30 days after termination of public service, whichever is sooner. The executive director
shall prescribe the manner and forms to be used by a governmental subdivision in administering a
periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment, the member must be granted allowable service credit for
the purchased period;
    ­
    (­
     6­) (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff under subdivision 12, limited to three months
allowable service per authorized temporary or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee
who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary

or seasonal layoff; ­
                    o­r
     ­
     (­
      7­) (8) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental
subdivision by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code,
title 38, section 4303(13), if the member returns to public service with the same governmental
subdivision upon discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required
under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the member did not separate
from uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than
honorable conditions. The service is credited if the member pays into the fund equivalent employee
contributions based upon the contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed
service was performed multiplied by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied
to the annual salary rate. The annual salary rate is the average annual salary during the purchase
period that the member would have received if the member had continued to be employed in
covered employment rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that
rate is not reasonably certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three
times the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from
the military service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the
contributions required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of
the discharge date. Payment may not be accepted following ­    20
                                                                ­ 30 days after termination of public
service under subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause
are not paid in full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full
and fractional number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained
by dividing the total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise
required under this clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent
additional employer contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the
member if the member makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must
be made from funds available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied
to the same annual salary rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The
governmental subdivision involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of
service credit obtainable under this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase
period is required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay
interest on all equivalent member and employer contribution amounts payable under this clause.
Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal
year of the leave or the break in service to the end of the month in which the payment is received.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period.    ­; or
   (9) a period specified under subdivision 40.
    (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable
service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
   (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief

section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage provided by the public
employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following the consolidation or under
section 353.665, subdivision 4, "applicable service" is a period of service credited by the local police
or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the consolidation based on law and on
bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date of the initiation of the consolidation
procedure.
   (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either for
vesting purposes or for benefit calculation purposes.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.01, subdivision 16b, is amended to read:

least three years of allowable service with the Public Employees Retirement Association or the
public employees police and fire plan and who performed service in the United States armed forces
before becoming a public employee, or who failed to obtain service credit for a military leave of
absence under subdivision 16, paragraph ­  (h­­
                                              ) (a), clause 7, is entitled to purchase allowable service
credit for the initial period of enlistment, induction, or call to active duty without any voluntary
extension by making payment under section 356.551. This authority is voided if the public employee
has ­
    n­o­
       t purchased service credit from any other Minnesota defined benefit public employee pension
plan, other than a volunteer fire plan, for the same period of service, or if the separation from the
United States armed forces was under less than honorable conditions.
    (b) A public employee who desires to purchase service credit under paragraph (a) must apply
with the executive director to make the purchase. The application must include all necessary
documentation of the public employee's qualifications to make the purchase, signed written
permission to allow the executive director to request and receive necessary verification of
applicable facts and eligibility requirements, and any other relevant information that the executive
director may require.
    (c) Allowable service credit for the purchase period must be granted by the Public Employees
Retirement Association or the public employees police and fire plan, whichever applies, to the
purchasing public employee upon receipt of the purchase payment amount. Payment must be made

    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.27, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Adjustment for erroneous receipts or disbursements. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), erroneous employee deductions and erroneous employer contributions and additional
employer contributions for a person, who otherwise does not qualify for membership under this
chapter, are considered:
    (1) valid if the initial erroneous deduction began before January 1, 1990. Upon determination of
the error by the association, the person may continue membership in the association while employed
in the same position for which erroneous deductions were taken, or file a written election to terminate
membership and apply for a refund upon termination of public service or defer an annuity under
section 353.34; or
    (2) invalid, if the initial erroneous employee deduction began on or after January 1, 1990. Upon
determination of the error, the association shall refund all erroneous employee deductions and all
erroneous employer contributions as specified in paragraph ­  (d
                                                               ­­) (e). No person may claim a right to
continued or past membership in the association based on erroneous deductions which began on or
after January 1, 1990.
    (b) Erroneous deductions taken from the salary of a person who did not qualify for membership
in the association by virtue of concurrent employment before July 1, 1978, which required
contributions to another retirement fund or relief association established for the benefit of officers
and employees of a governmental subdivision, are invalid. Upon discovery of the error, the
association shall remove all invalid service and, upon termination of public service, the association
shall refund all erroneous employee deductions to the person, with interest as determined under

    (g) If the accrual date of any retirement annuity, survivor benefit, or disability benefit is within
the limitation period specified in paragraph (c), and an overpayment has resulted by using invalid
service or salary, or due to any erroneous calculation procedure, the association must recalculate the
annuity or benefit payable and recover any overpayment as provided under subdivision 7b.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the association may apply the Revenue
Procedures defined in the federal Internal Revenue Service Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System and not issue a refund of erroneous employee deductions and employer contributions or not
recover a small overpayment of benefits if the cost to correct the error would exceed the amount of
the member refund or overpayment.
   (i) Any fees or penalties assessed by the federal Internal Revenue Service for any failure by an
employer to follow the statutory requirements for reporting eligible members and salary must be
paid by the employer.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) This section is effective the day following enactment.
   (b) The interest required on deductions in error as provided in paragraph (e) must be applied to
any refunds paid on or after June 1, 2009.

annuity or benefit that is the result of invalid salary included in the average salary used to calculate
the payment amount must be recovered, the association must determine the amount of the employee
deductions taken in error on the invalid salary, with interest determined in the manner provided for
a former member under subdivision 7, paragraph (e), clause (2), item (i), and must subtract that
amount from the total annuity or benefit overpayment, and the remaining balance of the overpaid
annuity or benefit, if any, must be recovered.
    (b) If the invalid employee deductions plus interest exceed the amount of the overpaid benefits,
the balance must be refunded to the person to whom the benefit or annuity is being paid.
  (c) Any invalid employer contributions reported on the invalid salary must be credited to the
employer as provided in subdivision 7, paragraph (e).
    (d) If a member or former member, who is receiving a retirement annuity or disability benefit for
which an overpayment is being recovered, dies before recovery of the overpayment is completed
and a joint and survivor optional annuity is payable, the remaining balance of the overpaid annuity
or benefit must continue to be recovered from the payment to the optional annuity beneficiary.
   (e) If the association finds that a refund has been overpaid to a former member, beneficiary or
other person, the amount of the overpayment must be recovered.

benefits paid to a coordinated member must terminate when the person reaches normal retirement
age. If the coordinated member is still totally and permanently disabled upon attaining normal
retirement age, the coordinated member is deemed to be on retirement status. If an optional annuity
is elected under subdivision 3a, the coordinated member shall receive an annuity under the terms of
the optional annuity previously elected, or, if an optional annuity is not elected under subdivision
3a, the coordinated member may elect to receive a normal retirement annuity under section
353.29 or an annuity equal to the disability benefit paid before the coordinated member reaches
normal retirement age, whichever amount is greater, or elect to receive an optional annuity under
section 353.30, subdivision 3. The annuity of a disabled coordinated member who attains normal
retirement age must be computed under the law in effect upon attainment of normal retirement
age. Election of an optional annuity must be made before the coordinated member attains normal
retirement age. If an optional annuity is elected, the election is effective on the date on which the
person attains normal retirement age and the optional annuity begins to accrue on the first day of
the month next following the month in which the person attains that age.

any other evidence presented by the member or by others interested therein, the executive director
finds that the member is totally and permanently disabled, the executive director shall grant the

or the new law coordinated program of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association who is
on an authorized medical leave of absence and subsequently returns to teaching service is entitled
to receive allowable service credit, not to exceed one year, for the period of leave, upon making the
prescribed payment to the fund. This payment must include the required employee and employer
contributions at the rates specified in section 354A.12, subdivisions 1 and ­   2 2a, as applied to the
member's average full-time monthly salary rate on the date the leave of absence commenced plus
annual interest at the rate of 8.5 percent per year from the end of the fiscal year during which the
leave terminates to the end of the month during which payment is made. The member must pay
the total amount required unless the employing unit, at its option, pays the employer contributions.
The total amount required must be paid by the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in
which the leave of absence terminated or before the member retires, whichever is earlier. Payment
must be accompanied by a copy of the resolution or action of the employing authority granting the
leave and the employing authority, upon granting the leave, must certify the leave to the association
in a manner specified by the executive director. A member may not receive more than one year of

the payment of a retirement annuity or other benefit payable under this chapter to the applicable
person or the person's estate, whichever applies, until all outstanding amounts have been recovered.
    (b) In the event the executive director determines that an overpaid annuity or benefit that is the
result of invalid salary included in the average salary used to calculate the payment amount must
be recovered, the executive director must determine the amount of the employee deductions taken
in error on the invalid salary, with interest as determined under 354A.37, subdivision 3, and must
subtract that amount from the total annuity or benefit overpayment, and the remaining balance of
the overpaid annuity or benefit, if any, must be recovered.

payment to the applicable financial institution for deposit in the person's individual account or
the person's joint account. If an overpayment of benefits is paid after the death of the annuitant
or benefit recipient, the chief administrative officer of the pension plan is authorized to issue
an administrative subpoena consistent with the requirements of section 13A.02, requiring the
applicable financial institution to disclose the names of all joint and co-owners of the account and
a description of all deposits to, and withdrawals from, the account which take place on or after the
death of the annuitant or benefit recipient. An overpayment to a joint account after the death of
the annuitant or benefit recipient must be repaid to the fund of the applicable covered retirement
plan by the joint tenant if the overpayment is not repaid to that fund by the financial institution
associated with the National Automated Clearinghouse Association or its successor. The governing
board of the covered retirement plan may prescribe the conditions under which these payments
may be made.

  Sec. 49. CITY OF DULUTH AND DULUTH AIRPORT AUTHORITY; CORRECTING
ERRONEOUS EMPLOYEE DEDUCTIONS, EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND
ADJUSTING OVERPAID BENEFITS.
    Subdivision 1. Application. Notwithstanding any provisions of sections 10 and 11, or Minnesota
Statutes 2008, chapters 353 and 356, to the contrary, this section establishes the procedures by
which the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association shall adjust erroneous
employee deductions and employer contributions paid on behalf of active employees and former
members by the city of Duluth and by the Duluth Airport Authority on amounts determined by the
executive director to be invalid salary under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.01, subdivision 10,
reported between January 1, 1997, and October 23, 2008, and for adjusting benefits that were paid
to former members and their beneficiaries based upon invalid salary amounts.
    Subd. 2. Refunds of employee deductions. (a) The executive director shall refund to active
employees or former members who are not receiving retirement annuities or benefits all erroneous
employee deductions identified by the city of Duluth or by the Duluth Airport Authority as
deductions taken from amounts determined to be invalid salary. The refunds must include interest
at the rate specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 353.34, subdivision 2, from the date each invalid
employee deduction was received through the date each refund is paid.
   (b) The refund payment for active employees must be sent to the applicable governmental
subdivision which must pay the refunded employee deductions plus interest to the active members
who are employees of the city of Duluth or who are employees of the Duluth Airport Authority, as
applicable.
   (c) Refunds to former members must be mailed by the executive director of the Public Employees
Retirement Association to the former member's last known address.
    Subd. 3. Benefit adjustments. (a) For a former member who is receiving a retirement annuity
or disability benefit, or for a person receiving an optional annuity or survivor benefit, the executive
director must:
   (1) adjust the annuity or benefit payment to the correct monthly benefit amount payable by
reducing the average salary under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.01, subdivision 17a, by the
invalid salary amounts;

   (2) determine the amount of the overpaid benefits paid from the effective date of the annuity or
benefit payment to the first of the month in which the monthly benefit amount is corrected;
    (3) calculate the amount of employee deductions taken in error on invalid salary, including
interest at the rate specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 353.34, subdivision 2, from the date
each invalid employee deduction was received through the date the annuity or benefit is adjusted as
provided under clause (1); and
    (4) determine the net amount of overpaid benefits by reducing the amount of the overpaid annuity
or benefit as determined in clause (2) by the amount of the erroneous employee deductions with
interest determined in clause (3).
    (b) If a former member's erroneous employee deductions plus interest determined under this
section exceeds the amount of the person's overpaid benefits, the balance must be refunded to the
person to whom the annuity or benefit is being paid.
   (c) The executive director shall recover the net amount of all overpaid annuities or benefits as
provided under subdivision 4.
    Subd. 4. Employer credits and obligations. (a) The executive director shall provide a credit
without interest to the city of Duluth and to the Duluth Airport Authority for the amount of that
governmental subdivision's erroneous employer contributions. The credit must first be used to offset
the net amount of the overpaid retirement annuities and the disability and survivor benefits that
remains after applying the amount of erroneous employee deductions with interest as provided
under subdivision 3, clause (4). The remaining erroneous employer contributions, if any, must be
credited against future employer contributions required to be paid by the applicable governmental
subdivision. If the overpaid benefits exceed the employer contribution credit, the balance of the
overpaid benefits is the obligation of the city of Duluth or the Duluth Airport Authority, whichever
is applicable.
    (b) The Public Employees Retirement Association board of trustees shall determine the period
of time and manner for the collection of overpaid retirement annuities and benefits, if any, from the
city of Duluth and the Duluth Airport Authority.

   Subd. 4b. Determination. (a) For purposes of this section, a contribution sufficiency exists if, for
purposes of the applicable plan, the total of the employee contributions, the employer contributions,
and any additional employer contributions, if applicable, exceeds the total of the normal cost, the
administrative expenses, and the amortization contribution of the retirement plan as reported in the
most recent actuarial valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the actuary retained under section
356.214 and prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a contribution deficiency exists if, for the applicable plan,
the total employee contributions, the employer contributions, and any additional employer
contributions are less than the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses, and the
amortization contribution of the retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation
of the retirement plan prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214 and prepared under
section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative Commission on Pensions
and Retirement.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4c. Contribution rate revision. Notwithstanding the contribution rate provisions stated
in plan law, the employee and employer contribution rates must be adjusted:
    (1) if after July 1, 2014, the regular actuarial valuations of the applicable plan under section
356.215 indicate that there is a contribution sufficiency under subdivision 2 equal to or greater than
0.5 percent of covered payroll for two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution
rates for the applicable plan must be decreased as determined under subdivision 4 to a level such
that the sufficiency equals no more than 0.25 percent of covered payroll based on the most recent
actuarial valuation; or
    (2) if after July 1, 2014, the regular actuarial valuations of the applicable plan under section
356.215 indicate that there is a deficiency equal to or greater than 0.5 percent of covered payroll for
two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution rates for the applicable plan must
be increased as determined under subdivision 4 to a level such that no deficiency exists based on
the most recent actuarial valuation.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 4d. Reporting, commission review. (a) The contribution rate increase or decrease must
be determined by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association, must be reported
to the chair and the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
on or before the next February 1, and, if the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
does not recommend against the rate change or does not recommend a modification in the rate
change, is effective on the next July 1 following the determination by the executive director that a
contribution deficiency or sufficiency has existed for two consecutive fiscal years based on the most
recent actuarial valuations under section 356.215. If the actuarially required contribution exceeds or
is less than the total support provided by the combined employee and employer contribution rates
for the applicable plan by more than 0.5 percent of covered payroll, the applicable plan employee
and employer contribution rates must be adjusted incrementally over one or more years to a level
such that there remains a contribution sufficiency of no more than 0.25 percent of covered payroll.
   (b) No incremental adjustment may exceed 0.25 percent of payroll for either the employee or

employer contribution rates per year in which any adjustment is implemented. For an applicable
plan, a contribution rate adjustment under this section must not be made until at least two years
have passed since fully implementing a previous adjustment under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.44, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Computation of formula program retirement annuity. (a) The formula retirement
annuity must be computed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formulas stated in
paragraph (b) or (d) on the basis of each member's average salary under section 354.05, subdivision
13a, for the period of the member's formula service credit.
     (b) This paragraph, in conjunction with paragraph (c), applies to a person who first became
a member of the association or a member of a pension fund listed in section 356.30, subdivision
3, before July 1, 1989, unless paragraph (d), in conjunction with paragraph (e), produces a higher
annuity amount, in which case paragraph (d) applies. The average salary as defined in section 354.05,

   For service rendered on or after July 1, 2006, the average salary as defined in section 354.05,
subdivision 13a, multiplied by the following percentages per year of service credit, determines the
amount the annuity to which the member qualifying therefor is entitled:
                                     Coordinated Member                Basic Member

    (c)(i) This paragraph applies only to a person who first became a member of the association or
a member of a pension fund listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, before July 1, 1989, and whose
annuity is higher when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with this paragraph than when
calculated under paragraph (d), in conjunction with paragraph (e).
  (ii) Where any member retires prior to normal retirement age under a formula annuity, the
member ­

in paragraph (b) reduced by one-quarter of one percent for each month that the member is under
normal retirement age at the time of retirement except that for any member who has 30 or more
years of allowable service credit, the reduction ­

                                                     l­ must be applied only for each month that the
member is under age 62.
   (iii) Any member whose attained age plus credited allowable service totals 90 years is entitled,
upon application, to a retirement annuity in an amount equal to the normal annuity provided in
paragraph (b), without any reduction by reason of early retirement.
    (d) This paragraph applies to a member who has become at least 55 years old and first became
a member of the association after June 30, 1989, and to any other member who has become at least
55 years old and whose annuity amount when calculated under this paragraph and in conjunction
with paragraph (e), is higher than it is when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with
paragraph (c). For a basic member, the average salary, as defined in section 354.05, subdivision 13a,
multiplied by the percent specified by section 356.315, subdivision 4, for each year of service for a
basic member ­  sh

                                i­­e determines the amount of the retirement annuity to which the basic
member is entitled. The annuity of a basic member who was a member of the former Minneapolis
Teachers Retirement Fund Association as of June 30, 2006, must be determined according to the
annuity formula under the articles of incorporation of the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement
Fund Association in effect as of that date. For a coordinated member, the average salary, as defined in
section 354.05, subdivision 13a, multiplied by the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision
2, for each year of service rendered before July 1, 2006, ­     an

356.315, subdivision 2b, for each year of service rendered on or after July 1, 2006, and before
July 1, 2011, and by the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision 2c, for each year of
service rendered after June 30, 2011, determines the amount of the retirement annuity to which
the coordinated member is entitled. For a member who has 30 or more years of allowable service
credit, the person's normal retirement age is age 62 and the age 55 minimum early reduced benefit
retirement age does not apply to the person.
    (e) This paragraph applies to a person who has become at least 55 years old and first becomes
a member of the association after June 30, 1989, and to any other member who has become at
least 55 years old and whose annuity is higher when calculated under paragraph (d) in conjunction
with this paragraph than when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with paragraph (c).

                                        l­ must be paid the normal annuity provided in paragraph
(d) reduced so that the reduced annuity is the actuarial equivalent of the annuity that would be
payable to the employee if the employee deferred receipt of the annuity and the annuity amount
were augmented at an annual rate of three percent compounded annually from the day the annuity
begins to accrue until the normal retirement age if the employee became an employee before July
1, 2006, and at 2.5 percent compounded annually if the employee becomes an employee after June
30, 2006. For a member who has 30 or more years of allowable service credit, the person's normal
retirement age is age 62 and the age 55 minimum early reduced benefit retirement age does not
apply to the person.
    (f) No retirement annuity is payable to a former employee with a salary that exceeds 95 percent of
the governor's salary unless and until the salary figures used in computing the highest five successive
years average salary under paragraph (a) have been audited by the Teachers Retirement Association
and determined by the executive director to comply with the requirements and limitations of section

most recent actuarial valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the actuary retained under section
356.214 and prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative

    (1) if after July 1, 2014, the regular actuarial valuations of the applicable plan under section
356.215 indicate that there is a contribution sufficiency under subdivision 2 equal to or greater than
0.5 percent of covered payroll for two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution
rates for the applicable plan must be decreased as determined under subdivision 4 to a level such
that the sufficiency equals no more than 0.25 percent of covered payroll based on the most recent
actuarial valuation; or
    (2) if after July 1, 2014, the regular actuarial valuations of the applicable plan under section
356.215 indicate that there is a deficiency equal to or greater than 0.5 percent of covered payroll for
two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution rates for the applicable plan must
be increased as determined under subdivision 4 to a level such that no deficiency exists based on
the most recent actuarial valuation.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.12, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4c. Reporting, commission review. (a) The contribution rate increase or decrease must

   (b) No incremental adjustment may exceed 0.25 percent of payroll for either the employee or
employer contribution rates per year in which any adjustment is implemented. For an applicable

with subdivision 7 is higher than it is when calculated under paragraph (c), in conjunction with
the provisions of subdivision 6. The retirement annuity formula percentage for purposes of this
paragraph is the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision 2, for each year of coordinated
service before July 1, 2011, and by the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision 2c, for each
year of service rendered after June 30, 2011. For a member who has 30 or more years of allowable
service credit, the person's normal retirement age is age 62 and the age 55 minimum early reduced
benefit retirement age does not apply to the person.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2011.
     Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.31, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4a. Computation of normal coordinated retirement annuity; Duluth fund. (a) This
subdivision applies to the new law coordinated program of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund
Association.
   (b) The normal coordinated retirement annuity is an amount equal to a retiring coordinated
member's average salary under section 354A.011, subdivision 7a, multiplied by the retirement
annuity formula percentage.
      (c) This paragraph, in conjunction with subdivision 6, applies to a person who first became a
member or a member in a pension fund listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, before July 1, 1989,
unless paragraph (d), in conjunction with subdivision 7, produces a higher annuity amount, in which
case paragraph (d) applies. T            ­h­­e­­

ranking members of the Senate Committee on Higher Education and the Higher Education Budget
and Policy Division of the Senate Committee on Finance and with the chair and ranking members
of the Higher Education and Workforce Development Finance and Policy Division of the Finance
Committee of the House of Representatives at least 30 days before their final adoption by the board
of trustees, shall post the same document on the system website at the same time, and shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed eligibility requirements. The type and any additional amount of the
incentive to be offered may vary by employee classification, as specified by the board.
   (d) The president of a college or university, consistent with paragraphs (b) and (c), may
designate:
    (1) specific departments or programs at the college or university whose employees are eligible
to be offered the incentive program; or
   (2) positions at the college or university eligible to be offered the incentive program.
   (e) The chancellor, consistent with paragraphs (b) and (c), may designate:
   (1) system office divisions whose employees are eligible to be offered the incentive program; or
   (2) positions at the system office eligible to be offered the incentive program.
    (f) Acceptance of the offered incentive must be voluntary on the part of the employee and must be
in writing. The incentive may only be offered at the sole discretion of the president of the applicable
college or university.
    (g) A decision by the president of a college or university or by the chancellor not to offer an
incentive may not be challenged.
    (h) The cost of the incentive is payable by the college or university on whose behalf the president
offered the incentive or from the system office budget if the chancellor offered the incentive. If a
college or university is merged, the remaining cost of any early separation incentive must be borne
by the successor institution. If a college or university is closed, the remaining cost of any early
separation incentive must be borne by the board of trustees.
   (i) Annually, the chancellor and the president of each college or university must report on the
number and types of early separation incentives which were offered and utilized under this section.
The report must be filed annually with the board of trustees and with the Legislative Reference
Library on or before September 1.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), a faculty member who is a member of the

college or university after June 30, 2009, may elect to transfer retirement coverage under the
teachers retirement plan within one year of the faculty member achieving tenure or its equivalent
at a Minnesota state college or university. The faculty member electing Teachers Retirement
Association coverage under this paragraph must purchase service credit in the Teachers Retirement
Association for the entire period of time covered under the individual retirement account plan and
the purchase payment amount must be determined under section 356.551. The Teachers Retirement
Association may charge a faculty member transferring coverage a reasonable fee to cover the
costs associated with computing the actuarial cost of purchasing service credit and making the
transfer. A faculty member transferring from the individual retirement account plan to the Teachers
Retirement Association may use any balances to the credit of the faculty member in the individual
retirement account plan, any balances to the credit of the faculty member in the higher education
supplemental retirement plan established under chapter 354C, or any source specified in section
356.441, subdivision 1, to purchase the service credit in the Teachers Retirement Association.
If the total amount of payments under this paragraph are less than the total purchase payment
amount under section 356.551, the payment amounts must be refunded to the applicable source.
The retirement coverage transfer and service credit purchase authority under this paragraph expires
with respect to any Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System faculty initially hired after
June 30, 2014.

    (c) A percentage adjustment must be computed and paid under this subdivision to eligible
persons under paragraph (b). This adjustment is determined by reference to the Consumer Price
Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination
of annual cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance. For calculations of the cost-of-living adjustment under paragraph (d), the term "average
third quarter Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided
by 3.
   (d) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
cost-of-living adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the same
average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting quotient,
and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
one percent.
    (e) The amount calculated under paragraph (d) is the full cost-of-living adjustment to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred
during the calendar year before the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, the full increase amount
must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar
year prior to the January 1 on which the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, calculated to the third
decimal place.
    (f) The adjustment may not be less than zero, nor greater than five percent.
    Sec. 2. BYLAW REVISION AUTHORIZATION.
    Consistent with Minnesota Statutes, section 354A.12, subdivision 4, the board of the St. Paul
Teachers Retirement Fund Association shall revise the bylaws or articles of incorporation of the
teachers retirement fund association to conform with section 1.
    Sec. 3. REPEALER.

                               RELIEF ASSOCIATION CHANGES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 69.77, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Relief association financial requirements; minimum municipal obligation. (a) The
officers of the relief association shall determine the financial requirements of the relief association
and minimum obligation of the municipality for the following calendar year in accordance with
the requirements of this subdivision. The financial requirements of the relief association and the
minimum obligation of the municipality must be determined on or before the submission date
established by the municipality under subdivision 5.
    (b) The financial requirements of the relief association for the following calendar year must
be based on the most recent actuarial valuation or survey of the special fund of the association
if more than one fund is maintained by the association, or of the association, if only one fund
is maintained, prepared in accordance with sections 356.215, subdivisions 4 to 15, and 356.216,
as required under subdivision 10. If an actuarial estimate is prepared by the actuary of the relief
association as part of obtaining a modification of the benefit plan of the relief association and the
modification is implemented, the actuarial estimate must be used in calculating the subsequent
financial requirements of the relief association.
    (c) If the relief association has an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most
recent actuarial valuation or survey, the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (1), (2), and
(3), constitute the financial requirements of the relief association for the following year. If the relief
association does not have an unfunded actuarial accrued liability as reported in the most recent
actuarial valuation or survey, the amount calculated under clauses (1) and (2) constitute the financial
requirements of the relief association for the following year. The financial requirement elements are:
    (1) the normal level cost requirement for the following year, expressed as a dollar amount, which
must be determined by applying the normal level cost of the relief association as reported in the
actuarial valuation or survey and expressed as a percentage of covered payroll to the estimated
covered payroll of the active membership of the relief association, including any projected change
in the active membership, for the following year;
   (2) for the Bloomington Fire Department Relief Association, the Fairmont Police Relief
Association, and the Virginia Fire Department Relief Association, to the dollar amount of normal
cost determined under clause (1) must be added an amount equal to the dollar amount of the
administrative expenses of the special fund of the association if more than one fund is maintained
by the association, or of the association if only one fund is maintained, for the most recent year,
multiplied by the factor of 1.035. The administrative expenses are those authorized under section
69.80. No amount of administrative expenses under this clause are to be included in the financial

fire state aid under subdivision 5, without inclusion of any additional funding amount to support
a minimum fire state aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, allocated one-half in
proportion to the population as shown in the last official statewide federal census for each fire
town and one-half in proportion to the market value of each fire town, including (1) the market
value of tax exempt property and (2) the market value of natural resources lands receiving in lieu
payments under sections 477A.11 to 477A.14, but excluding the market value of minerals. In
the case of incorporated or municipal fire departments furnishing fire protection to other cities,
towns, or townships as evidenced by valid fire service contracts filed with the commissioner, the
distribution must be adjusted proportionately to take into consideration the crossover fire protection
service. Necessary adjustments ­  sh

                                     l­ must be made to subsequent apportionments. In the case
of municipalities or independent fire departments qualifying for the aid, the commissioner shall
calculate the state aid for the municipality or relief association on the basis of the population and
the market value of the area furnished fire protection service by the fire department as evidenced
by duly executed and valid fire service agreements filed with the commissioner. If one or more fire
departments are furnishing contracted fire service to a city, town, or township, only the population
and market value of the area served by each fire department may be considered in calculating the
state aid and the fire departments furnishing service shall enter into an agreement apportioning
among themselves the percent of the population and the market value of each service area. The
agreement must be in writing and must be filed with the commissioner.
    (d) The minimum fire state aid allocation amount is the amount in addition to the initial fire state
allocation amount that is derived from any additional funding amount to support a minimum fire state
aid amount under section 423A.02, subdivision 3, and allocated to municipalities with volunteer
firefighters relief associations or covered by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter
retirement plan based on the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the annual financial reporting for the calendar year 1993 to the Office of
the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30 active volunteer firefighters, so that all municipalities or fire
departments with volunteer firefighters relief associations receive in total at least a minimum fire
state aid amount per 1993 active volunteer firefighter to a maximum of 30 firefighters. If a relief
association is established after calendar year 1993 and before calendar year 2000, the number of
active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief association as reported in the annual
financial reporting for calendar year 1998 to the Office of the State Auditor, but not to exceed 30
active volunteer firefighters, shall be used in this determination. If a relief association is established
after calendar year 1999, the number of active volunteer firefighters who are members of the relief
association as reported in the first annual financial reporting submitted to the Office of the State
Auditor, but not to exceed 20 active volunteer firefighters, must be used in this determination. If a
relief association is terminated as a result of providing retirement coverage for volunteer firefighters
by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan under chapter 353G, the
number of active volunteer firefighters of the municipality covered by the statewide plan as certified
by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association to the commissioner and
the state auditor, but not to exceed 30 active firefighters, must be used in this determination.
    (e) Unless the firefighters of the applicable fire department are members of the voluntary
statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to
the treasurer of the municipality where the fire department is located and the treasurer of the
municipality shall, within 30 days of receipt of the fire state aid, transmit the aid to the relief
association if the relief association has filed a financial report with the treasurer of the municipality
and has met all other statutory provisions pertaining to the aid apportionment. If the firefighters

firefighter retirement plan, the fire state aid must be paid to the executive director of the Public
Employees Retirement Association and deposited in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement fund.

section.

apportionments.

plan under chapter 353G, the executive director shall credit the fire state aid against future
municipal contribution requirements under section 353G.08 and shall notify the municipality or
independent nonprofit firefighting corporation of the fire state aid so credited at least annually.
If the municipality or the independent nonprofit firefighting corporation is not covered by the
voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan, the municipal treasurer shall,
within 30 days after receipt, transmit the fire state aid to the treasurer of the duly incorporated
firefighters' relief association if there is one organized and the association has filed a financial report

  Sec. 13. [353G.04]          INFORMATION           FROM       MUNICIPALITIES           AND     FIRE
DEPARTMENTS.
    The chief executive officers of municipalities and fire departments with volunteer firefighters
covered by the voluntary lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan shall provide all relevant
information and records requested by the board, the executive director, and the State Board of

   Sec. 14. [353G.05] PLAN COVERAGE ELECTION.
  Subdivision 1. Coverage. Any municipality or independent nonprofit firefighting corporation
may elect to have its volunteer firefighters covered by the retirement plan.
    Subd. 2. Election of coverage. (a) The process for electing coverage of volunteer firefighters
by the retirement plan is initiated by a request to the executive director for a cost analysis of the
prospective retirement coverage.
    (b) If the volunteer firefighters are currently covered by a volunteer firefighters' relief
association governed by chapter 424A, the cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage
must be requested jointly by the secretary of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, following
approval of the request by the board of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, and the chief
administrative officer of the entity associated with the relief association, following approval
of the request by the governing body of the entity associated with the relief association. If the
relief association is associated with more than one entity, the chief administrative officer of each
associated entity must execute the request. If the volunteer firefighters are not currently covered by
a volunteer firefighters' relief association, the cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage
must be requested by the chief administrative officer of the entity operating the fire department. The
request must be made in writing and must be made on a form prescribed by the executive director.
    (c) The cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage by the statewide retirement plan
must be based on the service pension amount under section 353G.11 closest to the service pension
amount provided by the volunteer firefighters' relief association, if there is one, or to the lowest
service pension amount under section 353G.11 if there is no volunteer firefighters' relief association,
rounded up, and any other service pension amount designated by the requester or requesters. The
cost analysis must be prepared using a mathematical procedure certified as accurate by an approved
actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association.

has filed the information required under section 69.051 in a timely fashion, upon request by the
executive director, the state auditor shall provide the most recent data available on the financial
33RD DAY]                           TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                       1889

condition of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, the most recent firefighter demographic
data available, and a copy of the current relief association bylaws. If a cost analysis is requested,
but no volunteer firefighters' relief association exists, the chief administrative officer of the
entity operating the fire department shall provide the demographic information on the volunteer
firefighters serving as members of the fire department requested by the executive director.
    (e) If a cost analysis is requested, the executive director of the State Board of Investment
shall review the investment portfolio of the relief association, if applicable, for compliance
with the applicable provisions of chapter 11A and for appropriateness for retention under the
established investment objectives and investment policies of the State Board of Investment. If
the prospective retirement coverage change is approved under paragraph (f), the State Board of
Investment may require that the relief association liquidate any investment security or other asset
which the executive director of the State Board of Investment has determined to be an ineligible
or inappropriate investment for retention by the State Board of Investment. The security or asset
liquidation must occur before the effective date of the transfer of retirement plan coverage. If
requested to do so by the chief administrative officer of the relief association, the executive
director of the State Board of Investment shall provide advice about the best means to conduct the
liquidation.
    (f) Upon receipt of the cost analysis, the governing body of the municipality or independent
nonprofit firefighting corporation associated with the fire department shall approve or disapprove
the retirement coverage change within 90 days. If the retirement coverage change is not acted upon
within 90 days, it is deemed to be disapproved. If the retirement coverage change is approved by
the applicable governing body, coverage by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter
retirement plan is effective on the next following January 1.
  Sec. 15. [353G.06] DISESTABLISHMENT OF PRIOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS'
RELIEF ASSOCIATION SPECIAL FUND UPON RETIREMENT COVERAGE CHANGE.
    Subdivision 1. Special fund disestablishment. (a) On the date immediately prior to the
effective date of the coverage change, the special fund of the applicable volunteer firefighters' relief
association, if one exists, ceases to exist as a pension fund of the association and legal title to the
assets of the special fund transfers to the State Board of Investment, with the beneficial title to the
assets of the special fund remaining in the applicable volunteer firefighters.
    (b) If the market value of the special fund of the volunteer firefighters' relief association for
which retirement coverage changed under this chapter declines in the interval between the date
of the most recent financial report or statement, and the special fund disestablishment date, the
applicable municipality shall transfer an additional amount to the State Board of Investment equal
to that decline. If more than one municipality is responsible for the direct management of the fire
department, the municipalities shall allocate the additional transfer amount among the various
applicable municipalities one-half in proportion to the population of each municipality and one-half
in proportion to the market value of each municipality.
    Subd. 2. Other relief association changes. In addition to the transfer and disestablishment of
the special fund under subdivision 1, notwithstanding any provisions of chapter 424A or 424B to
the contrary, upon the effective date of the change in volunteer firefighter retirement coverage, if
the relief association membership elects to retain the relief association after the benefit coverage
election, the following changes must be implemented with respect to the applicable volunteer
1890                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [33RD DAY

firefighters' relief association:
    (1) the relief association board of trustees membership is reduced to five, comprised of the fire
chief of the fire department and four trustees elected by and from the relief association membership;
    (2) the relief association may only maintain a general fund, which continues to be governed by
section 424A.06;
   (3) the relief association is not authorized to receive the proceeds of any state aid or to receive
any municipal funds; and
    (4) the relief association may not pay any service pension or benefit that was not authorized as
a general fund disbursement under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the relief association
in effect prior to the plan coverage election process.
    Subd. 3. Successor in interest. Upon the disestablishment of the special fund of the volunteer
firefighters' relief association under this section, the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan is the successor in interest of the special fund of the volunteer firefighters'
relief association for all claims against the special fund other than a claim against the special fund,
the volunteer firefighters' relief association, the municipality, the fire department, or any person
connected with the volunteer firefighters' relief association in a fiduciary capacity under chapter
356A or common law that was based on any act or acts which were not performed in good faith
and which constituted a breach of a fiduciary obligation. As the successor in interest of the special
fund of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan may assert any applicable defense in any judicial proceeding which the
board of trustees of the volunteer firefighters' relief association or the municipality would have
been entitled to assert.
    Sec. 16. [353G.07] CERTIFICATION OF GOOD TIME SERVICE CREDIT.
    (a) Annually, by March 31, the fire chief of the fire department with firefighters who are active
members of the retirement plan shall certify to the executive director the good time service credit
for the previous calendar year of each firefighter rendering active service with the fire department.
    (b) The fire chief shall provide to each firefighter rendering active service with the fire department
notification of the amount of good time service credit rendered by the firefighter for the calendar
year. The good time service credit notification must be provided to the firefighter 60 days before its
certification to the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association, along with
an indication of the process for the firefighter to challenge the fire chief's determination of good
time service credit. If the good time service credit amount is challenged in a timely fashion, the fire
chief shall hold a hearing on the challenge, accept and consider any additional pertinent information,
and make a final determination of good time service credit. The final determination of good time
service credit by the fire chief is not reviewable by the executive director of the Public Employees
Retirement Association or by the board of trustees of the Public Employees Retirement Association.
   (c) The good time service credit certification is an official public document. If a false good
time service credit certification is filed or if false information regarding good time service credits is
provided, section 353.19 applies.
    (d) The good time service credit certification must be expressed as a percentage of a full year
of service during which an active firefighter rendered at least the minimum level and quantity of
33RD DAY]                           TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                        1891

fire suppression, emergency response, fire prevention, or fire education duties required by the fire
department under the rules and regulations applicable to the fire department. No more than one year
of good time service credit may be certified for a calendar year.
    (e) If a firefighter covered by the retirement plan leaves active firefighting service to render
active military service that is required to be covered by the federal Uniformed Services Employment
and Reemployment Rights Act, as amended, the person must be certified as providing a full year
of good time service credit in each year of the military service, up to the applicable limit of the
federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. If the firefighter does not
return from the military service in compliance with the federal Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act, the good time service credits applicable to that military service credit
period are forfeited and cancel at the end of the calendar year in which the federal law time limit
occurs.
   Sec. 17. [353G.08] RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING; DISBURSEMENTS.
    (a) Annually, the executive director shall determine the funding requirements of each account
in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan on or before August 1.
The funding requirements as directed under this section, must be determined using a mathematical
procedure developed and certified as accurate by an approved actuary retained by the Public
Employees Retirement Association and based on present value factors using a six percent interest
rate, without any decrement assumptions. The funding requirements must be certified to the
entity or entities associated with the fire department whose active firefighters are covered by the
retirement plan.
    (b) The overall funding balance of each account for the current calendar year must be determined
in the following manner:
    (1) The total accrued liability for all active and deferred members of the account as of December
31 of the current year must be calculated based on the good time service credit of active and deferred
members as of that date.
    (2) The total present assets of the account projected to December 31 of the current year, including
receipts by and disbursements from the account anticipated to occur on or before December 31,
must be calculated. To the extent possible, the market value of assets must be utilized in making
this calculation.
    (3) The amount of the total present assets calculated under clause (2) must be subtracted from
the amount of the total accrued liability calculated under clause (1). If the amount of total present
assets exceeds the amount of the total accrued liability, then the account is considered to have a
surplus over full funding. If the amount of the total present assets is less than the amount of the total
accrued liability, then the account is considered to have a deficit from full funding. If the amount
of total present assets is equal to the amount of the total accrued liability, then the special fund is
considered to be fully funded.
    (c) The financial requirements of each account for the following calendar year must be
determined in the following manner:
    (1) The total accrued liability for all active and deferred members of the account as of December
31 of the calendar year next following the current calendar year must be calculated based on the good
1892                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [33RD DAY

time service used in the calculation under paragraph (b), clause (1), increased by one year.
    (2) The increase in the total accrued liability of the account for the following calendar year over
the total accrued liability of the account for the current year must be calculated.
   (3) The amount of anticipated future administrative expenses of the account must be calculated
by multiplying the dollar amount of the administrative expenses for the most recent prior calendar
year by the factor of 1.035.
    (4) If the account is fully funded, the financial requirement of the account for the following
calendar year is the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (2) and (3).
    (5) If the account has a deficit from full funding, the financial requirement of the account for
the following calendar year is the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (2) and (3) plus an
amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of the deficit from full funding of the account.
    (6) If the account has a surplus over full funding, the financial requirement of the account for the
following calendar year is the financial requirement of the account calculated as though the account
was fully funded under clause (4) and, if the account has also had a surplus over full funding during
the prior two years, additionally reduced by an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of the
surplus over full funding of the account.
    (d) The required contribution of the entity or entities associated with the fire department whose
active firefighters are covered by the retirement plan is the annual financial requirements of the
account of the retirement plan under paragraph (c) reduced by the amount of any fire state aid
payable under sections 69.011 to 69.051 reasonably anticipated to be received by the retirement plan
attributable to the entity or entities during the following calendar year, and an amount of interest on
the assets projected to be received during the following calendar year calculated at the rate of six
percent per annum. The required contribution must be allocated between the entities if more than
one entity is involved. A reasonable amount of anticipated fire state aid is an amount that does not
exceed the fire state aid actually received in the prior year multiplied by the factor 1.035.
    (e) The required contribution calculated in paragraph (d) must be paid to the retirement plan on
or before December 31 of the year for which it was calculated. If the contribution is not received by
the retirement plan by December 31, it is payable with interest at an annual compound rate of six
percent from the date due until the date payment is received by the retirement plan. If the entity does
not pay the full amount of the required contribution, the executive director shall collect the unpaid
amount under section 353.28, subdivision 6.
   (f) The assets of the retirement fund may only be disbursed for:
   (1) the administrative expenses of the retirement plan;
   (2) the investment expenses of the retirement fund;
   (3) the service pensions payable under section 353G.10, 353G.11, 353G.14, or 353G.15; and
   (4) the survivor benefits payable under section 353G.12.

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.219, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Content of reports. (a) The report required by subdivision 1 must include a written
statement of the investment policy. Following that initial report, subsequent reports must include
investment policy changes and the effective date of each policy change rather than a complete
statement of investment policy, unless the state auditor requests submission of a complete current
statement. The report must also include the information required by the following paragraphs, as
applicable.
    (b) If, after four years of reporting under this paragraph, the total portfolio time weighted rate
of return, net of all investment related costs and fees, provided by the public pension plan differs
by no more than 0.1 percent from the comparable return for the plan calculated by the Office of the
State Auditor, and if a public pension plan has a total market value of $25,000,000 or more as of the
beginning of the calendar year, and if the public pension plan's annual audit is performed by the state
auditor or by the legislative auditor, the report required by subdivision 1 must include the market
value of the total portfolio and the market value of each asset class included in the pension fund as of
the beginning of the calendar year and as of the end of the calendar year. At the discretion of the state

auditor, the public pension plan may be required to submit the market value of the total portfolio
and the market value of each investment account, investment portfolio, or asset class included in the
pension fund for each month, and the amount and date of each injection and withdrawal to the total
portfolio and to each investment account, investment portfolio, or asset class. If the market value
of a public pension plan's fund drops below $25,000,000 in a subsequent year, it must continue
reporting under this paragraph for any subsequent year in which the public pension plan is not fully
invested as specified in subdivision 1, paragraph (b), except that if the public pension plan's annual
audit is not performed by the state auditor or legislative auditor, paragraph (c) applies.
    (c) If paragraph (b) would apply if the annual audit were provided by the state auditor or
legislative auditor, the report required by subdivision 1 must include the market value of the total
portfolio and the market value of each asset class included in the pension fund as of the beginning
of the calendar year and for each month, and the amount and date of each injection and withdrawal
to the total portfolio and to each investment account, investment portfolio, or asset class.
    (d) For public pension plans to which paragraph (b) or (c) applies, the report required by
subdivision 1 must also include a calculation of the total time-weighted rate of return available
from index-matching investments assuming the asset class performance targets and target asset mix
indicated in the written statement of investment policy. The provided information must include a
description of indices used in the analyses and an explanation of why those indices are appropriate.
This paragraph does not apply to any fully invested plan, as defined by subdivision 1, paragraph
(b). Reporting by the State Board of Investment under this paragraph is limited to information on
the Minnesota public pension plans required to be invested by the State Board of Investment under
section 11A.23.
    (e) If a public pension plan has a total market value of less than $25,000,000 as of the beginning
of the calendar year and was never required to file under paragraph (b) or (c), the report required by
subdivision 1 must include the amount and date of each total portfolio injection and withdrawal. In
addition, the report must include the market value of the total portfolio as of the beginning of the
calendar year and for each quarter.
    (f) Any public pension plan reporting under paragraph (b) or (c) must include computed
time-weighted rates of return with the report, in addition to all other required information, as
applicable. The chief administrative officer of the public pension plan submitting the returns must
certify, on a form prescribed by the state auditor, that the returns have been computed by the pension
plan's investment performance consultant or custodial bank. The chief administrative officer of the
public pension plan submitting the returns also must certify that the returns are net of all costs and
fees, including investment management fees, and that the procedures used to compute the returns
are consistent with Bank Administration Institute studies of investment performance measurement
and presentation standards set by the C ­­

required under this paragraph are not provided, the reporting requirements of paragraph (c) apply.
    (g) For public pension plans reporting under paragraph (e), the public pension plan must retain
supporting information specifying the date and amount of each injection and withdrawal to each
investment account and investment portfolio. The public pension plan must also retain the market
value of each investment account and investment portfolio at the beginning of the calendar year and
for each quarter. Information that is required to be collected and retained for any given year or years
under this paragraph must be submitted to the Office of the State Auditor if the Office of the State
Auditor requests in writing that the information be submitted by a public pension plan or plans, or

33RD DAY]                            TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                        1911

    (b) Personnel serving in fire prevention positions are eligible to be members of the applicable
volunteer firefighter relief association and to qualify for service pension or other benefit coverage of
the relief association on the same basis as fire department personnel who perform fire suppression
duties.
    (c) Personnel serving in fire prevention positions also are eligible to receive any other benefits
under the applicable law or practice for services on the same basis as personnel who are employed
to perform fire suppression duties.
     Subd. 6. Return to active firefighting after break in service. (a) If a former active firefighter
who has ceased to perform or supervise fire suppression and fire prevention duties for at least 60 days
resumes performing active firefighting with the fire department associated with the relief association,
if the bylaws of the relief association so permit, the person may again become an active member of
the relief association.
    (b) A firefighter who returns to active relief association membership under paragraph (a) may
qualify for the receipt of a service pension from the relief association for the resumption service
period if the firefighter meets a minimum period of resumption service specified in the relief
association bylaws.
    (c) A firefighter who returns to active lump-sum relief association membership and who qualifies
for a service pension under paragraph (b) must have, upon a subsequent cessation of duties, any
service pension for the resumption service period calculated as a separate benefit. If a lump-sum
service pension had been paid to the firefighter upon the firefighter's previous cessation of duties, a
second lump-sum service pension for the resumption service period must be calculated to apply the
service pension amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the resumption service
for all years of the resumption service. No firefighter may be paid a service pension twice for the
same period of service. If a lump-sum service pension had not been paid to the firefighter upon the
firefighter's previous cessation of duties and the firefighter meets the minimum service requirement
of section 424A.02, subdivision 2, a service pension must be calculated to apply the service pension
amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the resumption service for all years
of service credit.
    (d) A firefighter who had not been paid a lump-sum service pension returns to active relief
association membership under paragraph (a), who does not qualify for a service pension under
paragraph (b), but who does meet the minimum service requirement of section 424A.02, subdivision
2, based on the firefighter's previous years of active service, must have, upon a subsequent cessation
of duties, a service pension calculated for the previous years of service based on the service pension
amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the resumption service, or, if the bylaws
so provide, based on the service pension amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's previous
cessation of duties.
    (e) If a firefighter receiving a monthly benefit service pension returns to active monthly benefit
relief association membership under paragraph (a), any monthly benefit service pension payable to
the firefighter is suspended as of the first day of the month next following the date on which the
firefighter returns to active membership. If the firefighter was receiving a monthly benefit service
pension, and qualifies for a service pension under paragraph (b), the firefighter is entitled to an
additional monthly benefit service pension upon a subsequent cessation of duties calculated based
on the resumption service credit and the service pension accrual amount in effect on the date of

the termination of the resumption service. The suspended initial service pension resumes as of the
first of the month next following the termination of the resumption service. If the firefighter was not
receiving a monthly benefit service pension and meets the minimum service requirement of section
424A.02, subdivision 2, a service pension must be calculated to apply the service pension amount
in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the resumption service for all years of service
credit.
    (f) A firefighter who was not receiving a monthly benefit service pension returns to active relief
association membership under paragraph (a), who does not qualify for a service pension under
paragraph (b), but who does meet the minimum service requirement of section 424A.02, subdivision
2, based on the firefighter's previous years of active service, must have, upon a subsequent cessation
of duties, a service pension calculated for the previous years of service based on the service pension
amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's termination of the resumption service, or, if the bylaws
so provide, based on the service pension amount in effect on the date of the firefighter's previous
cessation of duties.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
  Sec. 22. [424A.015] GENERALLY APPLICABLE VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS'
RELIEF ASSOCIATION PENSION PLAN REGULATION.
    Subdivision 1. Separation from active service; exception. (a) No service pension is payable to
a person while the person remains an active member of the respective fire department, and a person
who is receiving a service pension is not entitled to receive any other benefits from the special fund
of the relief association.
   (b) No relief association as defined in section 424A.001, subdivision 4, may pay a service
pension or disability benefit to a former member of the relief association if that person has not
separated from active service with the fire department to which the relief association is directly
associated, unless:
   (1) the person is employed subsequent to retirement by the municipality or the independent
nonprofit firefighting corporation, whichever applies, to perform duties within the municipal fire
department or corporation on a full-time basis;
    (2) the governing body of the municipality or of the corporation has filed its determination with
the board of trustees of the relief association that the person's experience with and service to the fire
department in that person's full-time capacity would be difficult to replace; and
   (3) the bylaws of the relief association were amended to provide for the payment of a service
pension or disability benefit for such full-time employees.
    Subd. 2. No assignment or garnishment. A service pension or ancillary benefits paid or
payable from the special fund of a relief association to any person receiving or entitled to receive
a service pension or ancillary benefits is not subject to garnishment, judgment, execution, or other
legal process, except as provided in section 518.58, 518.581, or 518A.53. No person entitled to a
service pension or ancillary benefits from the special fund of a relief association may assign any
service pension or ancillary benefit payments, and the association does not have the authority to
recognize any assignment or pay over any sum which has been assigned.
   Subd. 3. Purchase of annuity contract. A relief association that provides a service pension in
33RD DAY]                          TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                       1913

a single payment, if the governing articles of incorporation or bylaws so provide, may purchase an
annuity contract on behalf of a retiring member in an amount equal to the service pension otherwise
payable at the request of the person and in place of a direct payment to the person. The annuity
contract must be purchased from an insurance carrier licensed to do business in this state.
    Subd. 4. Transfer to individual retirement account. A relief association that is a qualified
pension plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and that provides a
single payment service pension, at the written request of the applicable retiring member or, following
the death of the active member, at the written request of the deceased member's surviving spouse,
may directly transfer on an institution-to-institution basis the eligible member's lump-sum pension or
the death or survivor benefit attributable to the member, whichever applies, to the requesting person's
individual retirement account under section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
  Sec. 23. [424A.016] DEFINED CONTRIBUTION VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS'
RELIEF ASSOCIATION SPECIFIC REGULATION.
    Subdivision 1. Defined contribution relief association authorization. If the articles of
incorporation or the bylaws governing the volunteer firefighters' relief association so provide
exclusively, the relief association may pay a defined contribution lump-sum service pension instead
of a defined benefit service pension governed by section 424A.02.
    Subd. 2. Defined contribution service pension eligibility. (a) A relief association, when its
articles of incorporation or bylaws so provide, may pay out of the assets of its special fund a defined
contribution service pension to each of its members who:
   (1) separates from active service with the fire department;
   (2) reaches age 50;
   (3) completes at least five years of active service as an active member of the municipal fire
department to which the relief association is associated;
   (4) completes at least five years of active membership with the relief association before
separation from active service; and
   (5) complies with any additional conditions as to age, service, and membership that are
prescribed by the bylaws of the relief association.
     (b) In the case of a member who has completed at least five years of active service as an active
member of the fire department to which the relief association is associated on the date that the
relief association is established and incorporated, the requirement that the member complete at least
five years of active membership with the relief association before separation from active service
may be waived by the board of trustees of the relief association if the member completes at least
five years of inactive membership with the relief association before the date of the payment of the
service pension. During the period of inactive membership, the member is not entitled to receive
any disability benefit coverage, is not entitled to receive additional individual account allocation
of fire state aid or municipal contribution towards a service pension, and is considered to have the
status of a person entitled to a deferred service pension.
1914                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [33RD DAY

    (c) The service pension earned by a volunteer under this chapter and the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of the relief association may be paid whether or not the municipality or nonprofit
firefighting corporation to which the relief association is associated qualifies for the receipt of fire
state aid under chapter 69.
    Subd. 3. Reduced vesting schedule. If the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a defined
contribution relief association so provide, a relief association may pay a reduced service pension
not to exceed the nonforfeitable percentage of the account balance to a retiring member who has
completed fewer than 20 years of service. The reduced service pension may be paid when the retiring
member meets the minimum age and service requirements of subdivision 2. The nonforfeitable
percentage of pension amounts are as follows:
                 Completed Years of Service                              Nonforfeitable Percentage of
                                                                              Pension Amount
                                5                                                  40 percent
                                6                                                  52 percent
                                7                                                  64 percent
                                8                                                  76 percent
                                9                                                  88 percent
                               10 and thereafter                                  100 percent

  Subd. 4. Individual accounts. (a) An individual account must be established for each firefighter
who is a member of the relief association.
   (b) To each individual active member account must be credited an equal share of:
   (1) any amounts of fire state aid received by the relief association;
    (2) any amounts of municipal contributions to the relief association raised from levies on real
estate or from other available municipal revenue sources exclusive of fire state aid; and
   (3) any amounts equal to the share of the assets of the special fund to the credit of:
    (i) any former member who terminated active service with the fire department to which the
relief association is associated before meeting the minimum service requirement provided for in
subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and has not returned to active service with the fire department for a
period no shorter than five years; or
    (ii) any retired member who retired before obtaining a full nonforfeitable interest in the amounts
credited to the individual member account under subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and any applicable
provision of the bylaws of the relief association. In addition, any investment return on the assets of
the special fund must be credited in proportion to the share of the assets of the special fund to the
credit of each individual active member account. Administrative expenses of the relief association
payable from the special fund may be deducted from individual accounts in a manner specified in
the bylaws of the relief association.
    (c) Amounts to be credited to individual accounts must be allocated uniformly for all years of
active service and allocations must be made for all years of service, except for caps on service
33RD DAY]                            TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                        1915

credit if so provided in the bylaws of the relief association. The allocation method may utilize
monthly proration for fractional years of service, as the bylaws or articles of incorporation of the
relief association so provide. The bylaws or articles of incorporation may define a "month," but the
definition must require a calendar month to have at least 16 days of active service. If the bylaws or
articles of incorporation do not define a "month," a "month" is a completed calendar month of active
service measured from the member's date of entry to the same date in the subsequent month.
    (d) At the time of retirement under subdivision 2 and any applicable provision of the bylaws of
the relief association, a retiring member is entitled to that portion of the assets of the special fund to
the credit of the member in the individual member account which is nonforfeitable under subdivision
3 and any applicable provision of the bylaws of the relief association based on the number of years
of service to the credit of the retiring member.
    (e) Annually, the secretary of the relief association shall certify the individual account allocations
to the state auditor at the same time that the annual financial statement or financial report and audit
of the relief association, whichever applies, is due under section 69.051.
    Subd. 5. Service pension installment payments. A defined contribution relief association, if
the governing bylaws so provide, may pay, at the option of the retiring member and in lieu of a
single payment of a service pension, the service pension in installments. The election of installment
payments is irrevocable and must be made by the retiring member in writing and filed with the
secretary of the relief association no later than 30 days before the commencement of payment of
the service pension. The amount of the installment payments must be the fractional portion of the
remaining account balance equal to one divided by the number of remaining annual installment
payments.
    Subd. 6. Deferred service pensions. (a) A member of a relief association is entitled to a deferred
service pension if the member:
   (1) has completed the lesser of the minimum period of active service with the fire department
specified in the bylaws or 20 years of active service with the fire department;
   (2) has completed at least five years of active membership in the relief association; and
    (3) separates from active service and membership before reaching age 50 or the minimum age
for retirement and commencement of a service pension specified in the bylaws governing the relief
association if that age is greater than age 50.
    (b) The deferred service pension is payable when the former member reaches age 50, or the
minimum age specified in the bylaws governing the relief association if that age is greater than age
50, and when the former member makes a valid written application.
    (c) A defined contribution relief association may, if its governing bylaws so provide, credit
interest or additional investment performance on the deferred lump-sum service pension during
the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, the interest must be paid:
    (1) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested by the relief association in a separate account established and maintained
by the relief association or if the deferred benefit amount is invested in a separate investment vehicle
held by the relief association; or
1916                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [33RD DAY

    (2) the investment return on the assets of the special fund of the defined contribution volunteer
firefighter relief association in proportion to the share of the assets of the special fund to the credit
of each individual deferred member account through the date on which the investment return is
recognized by and credited to the special fund.
    (d) The deferred service pension is governed by and must be calculated under the general
statute, special law, relief association articles of incorporation, and relief association bylaw
provisions applicable on the date on which the member separated from active service with the fire
department and active membership in the relief association.
    Subd. 7. Limitation on ancillary benefits. (a) A defined contribution relief association may only
pay an ancillary benefit which would constitute an authorized disbursement as specified in section
424A.05. The ancillary benefit for active members must equal the vested or nonvested amount of
the individual account of the member.
   (b) For deferred members, the ancillary benefit must equal the vested amount of the individual
account of the member. For the recipient of installment payments of a service pension, the ancillary
benefit must equal the remaining balance in the individual account of the recipient.
    Subd. 8. Filing of bylaw amendments. Each relief association to which this section applies
must file a revised copy of its governing bylaws with the state auditor upon the adoption of any
amendment to its governing bylaws by the relief association. Failure of the relief association to file
a copy of the bylaws or any bylaw amendments with the state auditor disqualifies the municipality
from the distribution of any future fire state aid until this filing requirement has been completed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 424A.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. (a) A defined benefit relief association, when its articles of
incorporation or bylaws so provide, may pay out of the assets of its special fund a defined benefit
service pension to each of its members who: (1) separates from active service with the fire
department; (2) reaches age 50; (3) completes at least five years of active service as an active
member of the municipal fire department to which the relief association is associated; (4) completes
at least five years of active membership with the relief association before separation from active
service; and (5) complies with any additional conditions as to age, service, and membership that
are prescribed by the bylaws of the relief association. A service pension computed under this
section may be prorated monthly for fractional years of service,      ­ ­f
                                                                        i­ as the bylaws or articles of
incorporation of the relief association so provide. The bylaws or articles of incorporation may
define a "month," but the definition must require a calendar month to have at least 16 days of active
service. If the bylaws or articles of incorporation do not define a "month," a "month" is a completed
calendar month of active service measured from the member's date of entry to the same date in the
subsequent month. The service pension earned by a volunteer firefighter under this chapter and the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the volunteer firefighters' relief association may be paid
whether or not the municipality or nonprofit firefighting corporation to which the relief association
is associated qualifies for the receipt of fire state aid under chapter 69.
   (b) In the case of a member who has completed at least five years of active service as an active
member of the fire department to which the relief association is associated on the date that the relief
association is established and incorporated, the requirement that the member complete at least five

years of active membership with the relief association before separation from active service may be
waived by the board of trustees of the relief association if the member completes at least five years
of inactive membership with the relief association before the date of the payment of the service
pension. During the period of inactive membership, the member is not entitled to receive disability
benefit coverage, is not entitled to receive additional service credit towards computation of a service
pension, and is considered to have the status of a person entitled to a deferred service pension under
subdivision 7.
    (c) No municipality or nonprofit firefighting corporation may delegate the power to take final
action in setting a service pension or ancillary benefit amount or level to the board of trustees of
the relief association or to approve in advance a service pension or ancillary benefit amount or level
equal to the maximum amount or level that this chapter would allow rather than a specific dollar
amount or level.
    (d) No relief association as defined in section 424A.001, subdivision 4, may pay a defined benefit
service pension or disability benefit to a former member of the relief association if that person has
not separated from active service with the fire department to which the relief association is directly
associated, unless:
   (1) the person is employed subsequent to retirement by the municipality or the independent
nonprofit firefighting corporation, whichever applies, to perform duties within the municipal fire
department or corporation on a full-time basis;
    (2) the governing body of the municipality or of the corporation has filed its determination with
the board of trustees of the relief association that the person's experience with and service to the fire
department in that person's full-time capacity would be difficult to replace; and
   (3) the bylaws of the relief association were amended to provide for the payment of a service
pension or disability benefit for such full-time employees.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 424A.02, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Nonforfeitable portion of service pension. (a) If the articles of incorporation or bylaws
of a defined benefit relief association so provide, ­
                                                    a the relief association may pay a reduced service
pension to a retiring member who has completed fewer than 20 years of service. The reduced service
pension may be paid when the retiring member meets the minimum age and service requirements
of subdivision 1.
   (b) The amount of the reduced service pension may not exceed the amount calculated by
multiplying the service pension appropriate for the completed years of service as specified in the
bylaws ­i
       t­m­­
           e­
            s multiplied by the applicable nonforfeitable percentage of pension.
    (c) For a defined benefit volunteer firefighter relief association that pays a lump-sum service
pension, a monthly benefit service pension, or a lump-sum service pension or a monthly benefit
service pension as alternative benefit forms, the nonforfeitable percentage of pension amounts are
as follows:

    Subd. 3. Flexible service pension maximums. (a) Annually on or before August 1 as part of
the certification of the financial requirements and minimum municipal obligation determined under
section 69.772, subdivision 4, or 69.773, subdivision 5, as applicable, the secretary or some other

receivable by the relief association, any amounts of municipal contributions to the relief association
raised from levies on real estate or from other available revenue sources exclusive of fire state aid,
and one-tenth of the amount of assets in excess of the accrued liabilities of the relief association
calculated under section 69.772, subdivision 2; 69.773, subdivisions 2 and 4; or 69.774, subdivision
2, if any.
    (b) The maximum service pension which the defined benefit relief association has authority
to provide for in its bylaws for payment to a member retiring after the calculation date when the
minimum age and service requirements specified in subdivision 1 are met must be determined using
the table in paragraph (c) or (d), whichever applies.
    (c) For a defined benefit relief association where the governing bylaws provide for a monthly
service pension to a retiring member, the maximum monthly service pension amount per month for
each year of service credited that may be provided for in the bylaws is the greater of the service
pension amount provided for in the bylaws on the date of the calculation of the average amount
of the available financing per active covered firefighter or the maximum service pension figure
corresponding to the average amount of available financing per active covered firefighter:

    (e) For a defined benefit relief association in which the governing bylaws provide for a monthly
benefit service pension as an alternative form of service pension payment to a lump-sum service
pension, the maximum service pension amount for each pension payment type must be determined
using the applicable table contained in this subdivision.

applicable maximum contained in paragraph (c) or (d) and the minimum average amount of available
financing per active covered firefighter is subsequently reduced because of a reduction in fire state
aid or because of an increase in the number of active firefighters, the relief association may continue
to provide the prior service pension amount specified in its bylaws, but may not increase the service
pension amount until the minimum average amount of available financing per firefighter under the
table in paragraph (c) or (d), whichever applies, permits.
   (g) No defined benefit relief association is authorized to provide a service pension in an amount
greater than the largest applicable flexible service pension maximum amount even if the amount of
available financing per firefighter is greater than the financing amount associated with the largest
applicable flexible service pension maximum.
    (h) The method of calculating service pensions must be applied uniformly for all years of active
service. Credit must be given for all years of active service except for caps on service credit if so
provided in the bylaws of the relief association.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 424A.02, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Penalty for paying pension greater than applicable maximum. (a) If a defined
benefit relief association pays a service pension greater than the maximum service pension
associated with the applicable average amount of available financing per active covered firefighter
under the table in subdivision 3, paragraph (c) or (d), whichever applies, the maximum service
pension under subdivision 3, paragraph (f), or the applicable maximum service pension amount
specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (g), whichever is less, the state auditor shall:
   (1) disqualify the municipality or the nonprofit firefighting corporation associated with the relief
association from receiving fire state aid by making the appropriate notification to the municipality
and the commissioner of revenue, with the disqualification applicable for the next apportionment
and payment of fire state aid; and

      Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 424A.02, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Deferred service pensions. (a) A member of a defined benefit relief association is
entitled to a deferred service pension if the member:
   (1) has completed the lesser of either the minimum period of active service with the fire
department specified in the bylaws or 20 years of active service with the fire department;
      (2) has completed at least five years of active membership in the relief association; and
    (3) separates from active service and membership before reaching age 50 or the minimum age
for retirement and commencement of a service pension specified in the bylaws governing the relief
association if that age is greater than age 50.
    (b) The deferred service pension is payable when the former member reaches age 50, or the
minimum age specified in the bylaws governing the relief association if that age is greater than age
50, and when the former member makes a valid written application.
    (c) A defined benefit relief association that provides a lump-sum service pension governed by
subdivision 3 may, when its governing bylaws so provide, pay interest on the deferred lump-sum
service pension during the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, interest must be paid in
one of the following manners:
    (1) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested by the relief association in a separate account established and maintained
by the relief association or if the deferred benefit amount is invested in a separate investment vehicle
held by the relief association; or
   (2) at an interest rate of up to five percent, compounded annually, as set by the board of directors
and approved as provided in subdivision 10.
    (d) Interest under paragraph (c), clause (2), is payable following the date on which the
municipality has approved the deferred service pension interest rate established by the board of
trustees.

for a lump-sum service pension to a retiring member, no ancillary benefit may be paid to any
former member or paid to any person on behalf of any former member after the former member (i)
terminates active service with the fire department and active membership in the relief association;

earned service pension must be calculated by multiplying the service pension amount specified in
the bylaws of the relief association at the time of death or disability, whichever applies, by the years
of service credited to the member or former member. The years of service must be determined as
of (i) the date the member or former member became entitled to the ancillary benefit; or (ii) the
date the member or former member died entitling a survivor or the estate of the member or former
member to an ancillary benefit. The ancillary benefit must be calculated without regard to whether
the member had attained the minimum amount of service and membership credit specified in the
governing bylaws. For active members, the amount of a permanent disability benefit or a survivor
benefit must be equal to the member's total earned service pension except that the bylaws of ­     a­

must be elected from the membership of the relief association and three trustees must be drawn
from the officials of the municipalities served by the fire department to which the relief association

or appointed municipal officials, selected as follows:
    (1) if only one municipality contracts with the independent nonprofit firefighting corporation, the

by the governing body of the municipality; or
  (2) if two or more municipalities contract with the independent nonprofit corporation, the
municipal trustees must be one official from each of the two largest municipalities in population
who are designated annually by the governing bodies of the applicable municipalities.
    (c) The municipal trustees for a relief association that is directly associated with a fire department
operated as or by a joint powers entity must be the fire chief of the fire department and two trustees
designated annually by the joint powers board. The municipal trustees for a relief association that
is directly associated with a fire department service area township must be the fire chief of the fire
department and two trustees designated by the township board.
    (d) If a relief association lacks the municipal board members provided for in paragraph (a), (b),
or (c) because the fire department is not located in or associated with an organized municipality,
joint powers entity, or township, the municipal board members must be the fire chief of the fire
department and two board members appointed from the fire department service area by the board
of commissioners of the applicable county.
   (e) The term of ­ht­­

                        s­
successor is qualified, whichever is later.
    (f) A municipal trustee under paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) has all the rights and duties accorded
to any other trustee, except the right to be an officer of the relief association board of trustees.
     (g) A board must have at least three officers, who are a president, a secretary and a treasurer.
These officers must be elected from among the elected trustees by either the full board of trustees or
by the relief association membership, as specified in the bylaws. In no event may any trustee hold
more than one officer position at any one time. The terms of the elected trustees and of the officers
of the board must be specified in the bylaws of the relief association, but may not exceed three years.
If the term of the elected trustees exceeds one year, the election of the various trustees elected from
the membership must be staggered on as equal a basis as is practicable.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 422A.06, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Retirement benefit fund. (a) The retirement benefit fund consists of amounts held for
payment of retirement allowances for members retired under this chapter, including any transfer
amount payable under subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
1944                                          JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                   [33RD DAY

    (b) Unless subdivision 3, paragraph (c), applies, assets equal to the required reserves for
retirement allowances under this chapter determined in accordance with the appropriate mortality
table adopted by the board of trustees based on the experience of the fund as recommended by the
actuary retained under section 356.214 must be transferred from the deposit accumulation fund
to the retirement benefit fund as of the last business day of the month in which the retirement
allowance begins. The income from investments of these assets must be allocated to this fund and
any interest charge under subdivision 3, paragraph (c), must be credited to the fund. There must be
paid from this fund the retirement annuities authorized by law. A required reserve calculation for
the retirement benefit fund must be made by the actuary retained under section 356.214 and must
be certified to the retirement board by the actuary retained under section 356.214.
    (c) There is established a deferred yield adjustment account which must be increased by the sale
or disposition of any debt securities at less than book value and must be decreased by the sale or
disposition of debt securities at more than book value. At the end of each fiscal year, a portion of
the balance of this account must be offset against the investment income for that year. The annual
portion of the balance to be offset must be proportional to the reciprocal of the average remaining life
of the bonds sold, unless the amounts are offset by gains on the future sales of these securities. The
amount of this account must be included in the recognized value of assets other than corporate stocks
and all other equity investments. In any fiscal year in which the gains on the sales of debt securities
exceed the discounts realized on the sales of such securities, the excess must be used to reduce the
balance of the account. If the realized capital gains are sufficient to reduce the balance of the account
to zero, any excess gains must be available for the calculation of postretirement adjustments.
    (d)(1) Annually, following June 30, the board shall use the procedures in clauses (2), (3), and
(4), to determine whether a postretirement adjustment is payable and to determine the amount of
any postretirement adjustment.
     (2) If the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor increases
from June 30 of the preceding year to June 30 of the current year, the board shall certify the
percentage increase. The amount certified must not exceed ­h                         t­­

    (3) In addition to any percentage increase certified under paragraph (b), the board shall use the
following procedures to determine if a postretirement adjustment is payable under this paragraph:
     (i) the board shall determine the market value of the fund on June 30 of that year;
    (ii) the amount of reserves required as of the current June 30 for the annuity or benefit payable to
an annuitant and benefit recipient must be determined by the actuary retained under section 356.214.
An annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or benefit for at least 12 full
months as of the current June 30 is eligible to receive a full postretirement adjustment. An annuitant
or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or benefit for at least one full month, but
less than 12 full months as of the current June 30, is eligible to receive a partial postretirement
adjustment. The amount of the reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are eligible
to receive a full postretirement benefit adjustment is known as "eligible reserves." The amount of the
reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are not eligible to receive a postretirement
adjustment is known as "noneligible reserves." For an annuitant or benefit recipient who is eligible

to receive a partial postretirement adjustment, additional "eligible reserves" is an amount that bears
the same ratio to the total reserves required for the annuitant or benefit recipient as the number of full
months of annuity or benefit receipt as of the current June 30 bears to 12 full months. The remainder
of the annuitant's or benefit recipient's reserves are "noneligible reserves";
    (iii) the board shall determine the percentage increase certified under clause (2) multiplied by
the eligible required reserves, as adjusted for mortality gains and losses, determined under item (ii);
   (iv) the board shall add the amount of reserves required for the annuities or benefits payable to
annuitants and benefit recipients of the participating public pension plans or funds as of the current
June 30 to the amount determined under item (iii);
   (v) the board shall subtract the amount determined under item (iv) from the market value of the
fund determined under item (i);
    (vi) the board shall adjust the amount determined under item (v) by the cumulative current
balance determined under item (viii) and any negative balance carried forward under item (ix);
   (vii) a positive amount resulting from the calculations in items (i) to (vi) is the excess market
value. A negative amount is the negative balance;
    (viii) the board shall allocate one-fifth of the excess market value or one-fifth of the negative
balance to each of five consecutive years, beginning with the fiscal year ending the current June 30;
and
    (ix) to calculate the postretirement adjustment under this paragraph based on investment
performance for a fiscal year, the board shall add together all excess market value allocated to
that year and subtract from the sum all negative balances allocated to that year. If this calculation
results in a negative number, the entire negative balance must be carried forward and allocated to
the next year. If the resulting amount is positive, a postretirement adjustment is payable under this
paragraph. The board shall express a positive amount as a percentage of the total eligible required
reserves certified to the board under item (ii).
    (4) The board shall determine the amount of any postretirement adjustment which is payable
using the following procedure:
    (i) the total "eligible" required reserves as of the first of January next following the end of the
fiscal year for the annuitants and benefit recipients eligible to receive a full or partial postretirement
adjustment as determined by item (ii) must be certified to the board by the actuary retained under
section 356.214. The total "eligible" required reserves must be determined by the actuary retained
under section 356.214 on the assumption that all annuitants and benefit recipients eligible to receive
a full or partial postretirement adjustment will be alive on the January 1 in question; and
    (ii) the board shall add the percentage certified under clause (2) to any positive percentage
calculated under clause (3). The board shall not subtract from the percentage certified under
paragraph (b) any negative amount calculated under clause (3). The sum of these percentages
must be carried to five decimal places and must be certified as the full postretirement adjustment
percentage.
    (e) The board shall determine the amount of the postretirement adjustment payable to each
eligible annuitant and benefit recipient. The dollar amount of the postretirement adjustment must

be calculated by applying the certified postretirement adjustment percentage to the amount of the
monthly annuity or benefit payable to each eligible annuitant or benefit recipient eligible for a full
adjustment.
    The dollar amount of the partial postretirement adjustment payable to each annuitant or benefit
recipient eligible for a partial adjustment must be calculated by first determining a partial percentage
amount that bears the same ratio to the certified full adjustment percentage amount as the number of
full months of annuity or benefit receipt as of the current June 30 bears to 12 full months. The partial
percentage amount determined must then be applied to the amount of the monthly annuity or benefit
payable to each annuitant or benefit recipient eligible to receive a partial postretirement adjustment.
The postretirement adjustments are payable on January 1 following the calculations required under
this section and must thereafter be included in the monthly annuity or benefit paid to the recipient.
Any adjustments under this section must be paid automatically unless the intended recipient files
a written notice with the applicable participating public pension fund or plan requesting that the
adjustment not be paid.
    (f) As of June 30 annually, the actuary retained under section 356.214 shall calculate the amount
of required reserves representing any mortality gains and any mortality losses incurred during the
fiscal year and report the results of those calculations to the plan. The actuary shall report separately
the amount of the reserves for annuitants and benefit recipients who are eligible for a postretirement
benefit adjustment and the amount of reserves for annuitants and benefit recipients who are not
eligible for a postretirement benefit adjustment. If the net amount of required reserves represents a
mortality gain, the board shall sell sufficient securities or transfer sufficient available cash to equal
the amount. If the amount of required reserves represents a mortality loss, the plan shall transfer an
amount equal to the amount of the net mortality loss. The amount of the transfers must be determined
before any postretirement benefit adjustments have been made. All transfers resulting from mortality
adjustments must be completed annually by December 31 for the preceding June 30. Interest is
payable on any transfers after December 31 based upon the preretirement interest assumption for
the participating plan or fund as specified in section 356.215, subdivision 8, stated as a monthly rate.
Book values of the assets of the fund must be determined only after all adjustments for mortality
gains and losses for the fiscal year have been made.
   (g) All money necessary to meet the requirements of the certification of withdrawals and all
money necessary to pay postretirement adjustments under this section are hereby and from time to
time appropriated from the postretirement investment fund to the board.
    (h) Annually, following the calculation of any postretirement adjustment payable from the
retirement benefit fund, the board of trustees shall submit a report to the executive director of
the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement and to the commissioner of finance
indicating the amount of any postretirement adjustment and the underlying calculations on which
that postretirement adjustment amount is based, including the amount of dividends, the amount of
interest, and the amount of net realized capital gains or losses utilized in the calculations.
    (i) With respect to a former contributing member who began receiving a retirement annuity or
disability benefit under section 422A.151, paragraph (a), clause (2), after June 30, 1997, or with
respect to a survivor of a former contributing member who began receiving a survivor benefit
under section 422A.151, paragraph (a), clause (2), after June 30, 1997, the reserves attributable
to the one percent lower amount of the cost-of-living adjustment payable to those annuity or
benefit recipients annually must be transferred back to the deposit accumulation fund to the credit

   17.4981 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR REGULATION OF AQUATIC FARMS.
    (a) Aquatic farms are licensed to culture private aquatic life. Cultured aquatic life is not wildlife.
Aquatic farms must be licensed and given classifications to prevent or minimize impacts on natural
resources. The purpose of sections 17.4981 to 17.4997 is to:
   (1) prevent public aquatic life from entering an aquatic farm;
    (2) prevent release of nonindigenous or exotic species into public waters without approval of
the commissioner;
   (3) protect against release of disease pathogens to public waters;
   (4) protect existing natural aquatic habitats and the wildlife dependent on them; and
   (5) protect private aquatic life from unauthorized taking or harvest.
   (b) Private aquatic life that is legally acquired and possessed is an article of interstate commerce
and may be restricted only as necessary to protect state fish and water resources.
    (c) The commissioner of natural resources shall establish license and other fees as provided
in section 16A.1285, subdivision 2, that would make aquaculture licensing and enforcement
self-sustaining. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner may, by written order
published in the State Register, establish the fees required by this section. The fees are not subject
to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The commissioner
shall develop best management practices for aquaculture to ensure the long-term sustainability
of aquaculture and wetlands used for aquaculture, including, but not limited to, fish farming in
man-made ponds.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 17.4988, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Inspection and additional fees. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner
may, by written order published in the State Register, establish fees for the services listed in clauses
(1) to (3) and the additional fee required under subdivision 2, paragraph (a). The fees must be set in
an amount that does not recover significantly more or less than the cost of providing the service. The
fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
The services covered under this provision include:
   (1) initial inspection of each water to be licensed;
   (2) fish health inspection and certification, including initial tissue sample collection, basic fish
health assessment, viral pathogen testing, and bacteriological testing; and
   (3) initial inspection for containment and quarantine facility inspections.

   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 97C.081, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Permit application process. (a) Beginning August 1 each year, the commissioner shall
accept permit applications for fishing contests to be held in the following year.
    (b) If the number of permit applications received by the commissioner from August 1 through the
last Friday in September exceeds the limits specified in subdivisions 7 and 8, the commissioner shall
notify the affected applicants that their requested locations and time period are subject to a drawing.
After notification, the commissioner shall allow the affected applicants a minimum of seven days
to change the location or time period requested on their applications, provided that the change is
not to a location or time period for which applications are already at or above the limits specified in
subdivisions 7 and 8.
    (c) After the applicants have been given at least seven days to change their applications, the
commissioner shall conduct a drawing for all locations and time periods for which applications
exceed limits. First preference in the drawings shall be given to applicants for established or
traditional fishing contests, and second preference to applicants for contests that are not established
as traditional fishing contests based on the number of times they have been unsuccessful in previous
drawings. Except for applicants of established or traditional fishing contests, an applicant who
is successful in a drawing loses all accumulated preference. "Established or traditional fishing
contest" means a fishing contest that was issued permits in 1999 and 2000 or was issued permits
four out of five years from 1996 to 2000 for the same lake and time period. Beginning with 2001,
established or traditional fishing contests must continue to be conducted at least four out of five
years for the same lake and time period to remain established or traditional.

are submitted by 4:30 p.m. on the last Friday in September. The commissioner may approve a
permit application that is received after 4:30 p.m. on the last Friday in September if approving the
application would not result in exceeding the limits in subdivisions 7 and 8.
   (e) The commissioner shall develop an online Web-based fishing contest permit application
process.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 97C.081, subdivision 9, is amended to read:

require proof from permittees that prefishing restrictions on the permit are communicated to fishing
contest participants and enforced.
   (b) The commissioner may require permit restrictions on the hours that a permitted fishing
contest is conducted, including, but not limited to, starting and ending times.
   (c) The commissioner may require permit restrictions on the number of parking spaces that
may be used on a state-owned public water access site. The commissioner may require proof from
permittees that parking restrictions on the permit are communicated to fishing contest participants

and enforced.
    (d) To prevent undue mortality of released fish, the commissioner may require restrictions for
off-site weigh-ins and live releases on a fishing contest permit or may deny permits requesting an
off-site weigh-in or live release. The commissioner may allow for live release weigh-ins at public
accesses.
    (e) A person may not transfer a fishing contest permit to another person.
   (f) Failure to comply with fishing contest permit restrictions may be considered grounds for
denial of future permit applications.

prosecution data, criminal court data, custody and supervision data.
    (b) Classification. Criminal history data maintained by agencies, political subdivisions and
statewide systems are classified as private, pursuant to section 13.02, subdivision 12, except that
data created, collected, or maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that identify an
individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted,
associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement
information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the
offense. If an individual's name or other identifying information is erroneously associated with a
criminal history and a determination is made through a fingerprint verification that the individual is
not the subject of the criminal history, the name or other identifying information must be redacted
from the public criminal history data. The name and other identifying information must be retained
in the criminal history and are classified as private data.

   The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall provide to the public at the central office of the
bureau the ability to inspect in person, at no charge, through a computer monitor the criminal
conviction data classified as public under this subdivision.
    (c) Limitation. Nothing in paragraph (a) or (b) shall limit public access to data made public by
section 13.82.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.871, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 12. Crime alert access request. Data regarding contact information provided by a citizen
requesting a crime alert are classified under section 611A.0393.
  Sec. 3. [16C.092] HIRING REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN PROCUREMENT
CONTRACTS.
    The commissioner may adopt rules under section 16C.03, that require persons or entities that
contract with the state for construction or services contracts to employ a minimum number or
percentage of low-income persons or former offenders in the performance of the contract and
for the duration of the contract unless the employee is terminated for cause. At a minimum, the
rules must state the type of contracts covered, the minimum dollar amount of the contract to
which the hiring requirement applies, a definition of "low-income" if the policy applies to hiring
of low-income persons, how the required number or percentage of persons employed may be
calculated, and the extent to which the rules may be met by existing employees of the contractor or
new hires by the contractor. The rules may provide for penalties to be imposed on the contractor
for failure to comply with the hiring requirements of the policy including, but not limited to, civil
penalties and restrictions on future contractual agreements with the contractor. This section does
not apply to contracts between the state and an exclusive representative of state employees. For the
purposes of this section, "former offender" means an individual who is not currently incarcerated
but who has previously been convicted of a felony, regardless of whether the individual is currently
under correctional supervision.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 84.027, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Background checks for volunteer instructors. (a) The commissioner may conduct
background checks for volunteer instructor applicants for department safety training and education
programs, including the programs established under sections 84.791 (youth off-highway motorcycle

84.925 (youth all-terrain vehicle safety education and training), 97B.015 (youth firearms safety
training), and 97B.025 (hunter and trapper education and training).
    (b) The commissioner shall perform the background check by retrieving criminal history data as

student volunteers, who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other
extracurricular academic coaching services to a school, regardless of whether any compensation

Criminal Apprehension and the school district of conducting the criminal history background
check. A school hiring authority deciding to receive payment may, at its discretion, accept payment

superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension directly to conduct the background check.

criminal history background check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by
the State Board of Teaching or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an
offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.

    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 136F.581, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 5. Hiring requirements in certain procurement contracts. The board may develop
policies and procedures consistent with this section that require persons or entities that contract
with the board or the colleges and universities for construction or services contracts to employ a
minimum number or percentage of low-income persons or former offenders in the performance of
the contract and for the duration of the contract unless the employee is terminated for cause. At
a minimum, the policies and procedures must state the type of contracts covered, the minimum
dollar amount of the contract to which the hiring requirement applies, a definition of "low-income"
if the policies and procedures apply to hiring of low-income persons, how the required number or
percentage of persons employed may be calculated, and the extent to which the requirements may
be met by existing employees of the contractor or new hires by the contractor. The policies and
procedures may provide for penalties to be imposed on the contractor for failure to comply with the
hiring requirements of the policies and procedures including, but not limited to, civil penalties and
restrictions on future contractual agreements between the university and the contractor. This section
does not apply to contracts between the board and the colleges and universities and an exclusive
representative of their employees. For the purposes of this section, "former offender" means an
individual who is not currently incarcerated but who has previously been convicted of a felony,
regardless of whether the individual is currently under correctional supervision.
  Sec. 8. [137.32] HIRING REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN PROCUREMENT
CONTRACTS.
    The Regents of the University of Minnesota may adopt a policy that persons or entities that
contract with the university for construction or services contracts be required to employ a minimum
number or percentage of low-income persons or former offenders in the performance of the contract
and for the duration of the contract unless the employee is terminated for cause. The regents shall
establish procurement rules to govern the program authorized by this section. At a minimum,
the rules must state the type of contracts covered, the minimum dollar amount of the contract to
which the hiring requirement applies, a definition of "low-income" if the ordinance applies to
hiring of low-income persons, how the required number or percentage of persons employed may
be calculated, and the extent to which the requirements may be met by existing employees of the
contractor or new hires by the contractor. The rules may provide for penalties to be imposed on
the contractor for failure to comply with the hiring requirements of the rules including, but not
limited to, civil penalties and restrictions on future contractual agreements between the university
and the contractor. This section does not apply to contracts between the university and an exclusive
representative of university employees. For the purposes of this section, "former offender" means
an individual who is not currently incarcerated but who has previously been convicted of a felony,
regardless of whether the individual is currently under correctional supervision.

      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 152.02, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Schedule V; restrictions on methamphetamine precursor drugs. (a) As used in this
subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given:
    (1) "methamphetamine precursor drug" means any compound, mixture, or preparation intended
for human consumption containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as its sole active ingredient or as
one of its active ingredients; and
    (2) "over-the-counter sale" means a retail sale of a drug or product but does not include the sale
of a drug or product pursuant to the terms of a valid prescription.
      (b) The following items are listed in Schedule V:
   (1) any compound, mixture, or preparation containing any of the following limited quantities
of narcotic drugs, which shall include one or more nonnarcotic active medicinal ingredients in
sufficient proportion to confer upon the compound, mixture or preparation valuable medicinal
qualities other than those possessed by the narcotic drug alone:
      (i) not more than 100 milligrams of dihydrocodeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
      (ii) not more than 100 milligrams of ethylmorphine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
    (iii) not more than 2.5 milligrams of diphenoxylate and not less than 25 micrograms of atropine
sulfate per dosage unit; or
      (iv) not more than 15 milligrams of anhydrous morphine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
and
    (2) any compound, mixture, or preparation containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as its sole
active ingredient or as one of its active ingredients.
   (c) No person may sell in a single over-the-counter sale more than two packages of a
methamphetamine precursor drug or a combination of methamphetamine precursor drugs or any
combination of packages exceeding a total weight of six grams.
      (d) Over-the-counter sales of methamphetamine precursor drugs are limited to:
   (1) packages containing not more than a total of three grams of one or more methamphetamine
precursor drugs, calculated in terms of ephedrine base or pseudoephedrine base; or
   (2) for nonliquid products, sales in blister packs, where each blister contains not more than two
dosage units, or, if the use of blister packs is not technically feasible, sales in unit dose packets or
pouches.
    (e) A business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine precursor drugs in an
over-the-counter sale shall ensure that all packages of the drugs are displayed behind a checkout
counter where the public is not permitted and are offered for sale only by a licensed pharmacist,
a registered pharmacy technician, or a pharmacy clerk. The establishment shall ensure that the
person making the sale requires the buyer:
      (1) to provide photographic identification showing the buyer's date of birth; and
1992                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [33RD DAY

   (2) to sign a written or electronic document detailing the date of the sale, the name of the buyer,
and the amount of the drug sold.
   A document described under clause (2) must be retained by the establishment for at least three
years and must at all reasonable times be open to the inspection of any law enforcement agency.
   Nothing in this paragraph requires the buyer to obtain a prescription for the drug's purchase.
   (f) No person may acquire through over-the-counter sales more than six grams of
methamphetamine precursor drugs within a 30-day period.
    (g) No person may sell in an over-the-counter sale a methamphetamine precursor drug to a
person under the age of 18 years. It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this paragraph if
the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant reasonably and in good
faith relied on proof of age as described in section 340A.503, subdivision 6.
   (h) A person who knowingly violates paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is guilty of a misdemeanor
and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or to payment of a fine of not
more than $1,000, or both.
    (i) An owner, operator, supervisor, or manager of a business establishment that offers for sale
methamphetamine precursor drugs whose employee or agent is convicted of or charged with
violating paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is not subject to the criminal penalties for violating any
of those paragraphs if the person:
    (1) did not have prior knowledge of, participate in, or direct the employee or agent to commit
the violation; and
   (2) documents that an employee training program was in place to provide the employee or
agent with information on the state and federal laws and regulations regarding methamphetamine
precursor drugs.
    (j) Any person employed by a business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine
precursor drugs who sells such a drug to any person in a suspicious transaction shall report the
transaction to the owner, supervisor, or manager of the establishment. The owner, supervisor, or
manager may report the transaction to local law enforcement. A person who reports information
under this subdivision in good faith is immune from civil liability relating to the report.
   (k) Paragraphs (b) to (j) do not apply to:
   (1) pediatric products labeled pursuant to federal regulation primarily intended for
administration to children under 12 years of age according to label instructions;
  (2) methamphetamine precursor drugs that are certified by the Board of Pharmacy as being
manufactured in a manner that prevents the drug from being used to manufacture methamphetamine;
   (3) methamphetamine precursor drugs in gel capsule or liquid form; or
    (4) compounds, mixtures, or preparations in powder form where pseudoephedrine constitutes
less than one percent of its total weight and is not its sole active ingredient.
   (l) The Board of Pharmacy, in consultation with the Department of Public Safety, shall certify

sections 151.42 to 151.51 and registered with and regulated by the United States Drug Enforcement
Administration are exempt from the methamphetamine precursor drug storage requirements of this
section.

establishment of over-the-counter products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. All
ordinances enacted prior to the effective date of this act are void.

degree of risk than that created by the employee or former employee interacting with the public
outside of the duties of the position or that might be created by being employed in general;
    (2) before the occurrence of the act giving rise to the civil action, a court order sealed any record
of the criminal case or the employee or former employee received a pardon; or
   (3) the record is of an arrest or charge that did not result in a criminal conviction.
    Subd. 2. Relation to other law. This section does not supersede a statutory requirement to
conduct a criminal history background investigation or consider criminal history records in hiring

   Sec. 18. [243.205] NOTICE OF RESTORATION OF RIGHT TO VOTE.
    Subdivision 1. Correctional facilities; designation of official. The chief executive officer of
each state and local correctional facility shall designate an official within the facility to provide the
notice and application required under this section to inmates whose right to vote has been restored.
The official shall maintain an adequate supply of voter registration applications and informational
materials for this purpose.
   Subd. 2. Notice requirement. A notice of restoration of voting rights and a voter registration
application must be provided as follows:
    (1) the chief executive officer of each state and local correctional facility shall provide the
notice and application to an inmate being released from the facility following incarceration for a
felony-level offense; and
   (2) a probation or parole officer or supervised release agent shall provide the notice and
application to all individuals under correctional supervision for a felony-level offense.
    Subd. 3. Form of notice. The notice required by subdivision 2 must appear substantially as
follows:
                  "NOTICE OF RESTORATION OF YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE.
    Your receipt of this notice today means that your right to vote in Minnesota has been restored.
Before you can vote on election day, you still need to register to vote. To register, you can complete
a voter registration application and return it to the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State. You
also can register to vote in your polling place on election day. You will not be permitted to cast a
ballot until you register to vote. The first time you appear at your polling place to cast a ballot, you
may be required to provide proof of your current residence."
   Subd. 4. Failure to provide notice. A failure to provide proper notice as required by this section
does not prevent the restoration of the person's right to vote.

the response must include a copy of the public portion of the investigation memorandum under
section 626.556, subdivision 10f, or the public portion of the investigation memorandum under
section 626.557, subdivision 12b. When the background study shows that the subject has been
determined by a county adult protection or child protection agency to have been responsible for
maltreatment, the court shall be informed of the county, the date of the finding, and the nature of the
maltreatment that was substantiated. The commissioner shall provide the court with information
from the National Criminal Records Repository within three working days of the commissioner's
receipt of the data. When the commissioner finds no criminal history or substantiated maltreatment
on a background study subject, the commissioner shall make these results available to the court
electronically through the secure online background study system.
   (d) Notwithstanding section 626.556, subdivision 10f, or 626.557, subdivision 12b, if the
commissioner or county lead agency has information that a person on whom a background study
was previously done under this section has been determined to be a perpetrator of maltreatment of
a minor or vulnerable adult, the commissioner or the county may provide this information to the
court that requested the background study.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Relief by court. (a) Upon notice and hearing, the court may provide relief as follows:
   (1) restrain the abusing party from committing acts of domestic abuse;
    (2) exclude the abusing party from the dwelling which the parties share or from the residence of
the petitioner;
   (3) exclude the abusing party from a reasonable area surrounding the dwelling or residence,
which area shall be described specifically in the order;
    (4) award temporary custody or establish temporary parenting time with regard to minor children
of the parties on a basis which gives primary consideration to the safety of the victim and the
children. In addition to the primary safety considerations, the court may consider particular best
interest factors that are found to be relevant to the temporary custody and parenting time award.
Findings under section 257.025, 518.17, or 518.175 are not required with respect to the particular
best interest factors not considered by the court. If the court finds that the safety of the victim or the
children will be jeopardized by unsupervised or unrestricted parenting time, the court shall condition
or restrict parenting time as to time, place, duration, or supervision, or deny parenting time entirely,
as needed to guard the safety of the victim and the children. The court's decision on custody and
parenting time shall in no way delay the issuance of an order for protection granting other relief
provided for in this section. The court must not enter a parenting plan under section 518.1705 as
part of an action for an order for protection;
    (5) on the same basis as is provided in chapter 518 or 518A, establish temporary support for
minor children or a spouse, and order the withholding of support from the income of the person
obligated to pay the support according to chapter 518A;
   (6) provide upon request of the petitioner counseling or other social services for the parties, if
married, or if there are minor children;
    (7) order the abusing party to participate in treatment or counseling services, including requiring
the abusing party to successfully complete a domestic abuse counseling program or educational

program under section 518B.02;
    (8) award temporary use and possession of property and restrain one or both parties from
transferring, encumbering, concealing, or disposing of property except in the usual course
of business or for the necessities of life, and to account to the court for all such transfers,
encumbrances, dispositions, and expenditures made after the order is served or communicated to
the party restrained in open court;
   (9) exclude the abusing party from the place of employment of the petitioner, or otherwise limit
access to the petitioner by the abusing party at the petitioner's place of employment;
    (10) order the abusing party to have no contact with the petitioner whether in person, by
telephone, mail, or electronic mail or messaging, through a third party, or by any other means;
   (11) order the abusing party to pay restitution to the petitioner;
   (12) order the continuance of all currently available insurance coverage without change in
coverage or beneficiary designation; ­

    (13) order, in its discretion, other relief as it deems necessary for the protection of a family
or household member, including orders or directives to the sheriff or other law enforcement or
corrections officer as provided by this section; or
    (14) direct the care, possession, or control of a pet or companion animal owned, possessed, or
kept by the petitioner or respondent or a child of the petitioner or respondent, or order the respondent
to have no contact with the pet or companion animal.
   (b) Any relief granted by the order for protection shall be for a period not to exceed two years,
except when the court determines a longer period is appropriate. When a referee presides at the
hearing on the petition, the order granting relief becomes effective upon the referee's signature.
    (c) An order granting the relief authorized in paragraph (a), clause (1), may not be vacated
or modified in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, except that the court
may hear a motion for modification of an order for protection concurrently with a proceeding for
dissolution of marriage upon notice of motion and motion. The notice required by court rule shall
not be waived. If the proceedings are consolidated and the motion to modify is granted, a separate
order for modification of an order for protection shall be issued.
    (d) An order granting the relief authorized in paragraph (a), clause (2) or (3), is not voided by
the admittance of the abusing party into the dwelling from which the abusing party is excluded.
    (e) If a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is pending between the parties,
the court shall provide a copy of the order for protection to the court with jurisdiction over the
dissolution or separation proceeding for inclusion in its file.
   (f) An order for restitution issued under this subdivision is enforceable as civil judgment.
   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Ex parte order. (a) Where an application under this section alleges an immediate and
present danger of domestic abuse, the court may grant an ex parte order for protection and granting
relief as the court deems proper, including an order:

   (1) restraining the abusing party from committing acts of domestic abuse;
   (2) excluding any party from the dwelling they share or from the residence of the other except
by further order of the court;
   (3) excluding the abusing party from the place of employment of the petitioner or otherwise
limiting access to the petitioner by the abusing party at the petitioner's place of employment;
    (4) ordering the abusing party to have no contact with the petitioner whether in person, by
telephone, mail, e-mail, through electronic devices, or through a third party; ­
                                                                               an

   (5) continuing all currently available insurance coverage without change in coverage or
beneficiary designation; or
   (6) directing the care, possession, or control of a pet or companion animal owned, possessed, or
kept by a party or a child of a party, or ordering the abusing party to have no contact with the pet or
companion animal.
   (b) A finding by the court that there is a basis for issuing an ex parte order for protection
constitutes a finding that sufficient reasons exist not to require notice under applicable court rules
governing applications for ex parte relief.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (d), an ex parte order for protection shall be effective for a fixed period
set by the court, as provided in subdivision 6, paragraph (b), or until modified or vacated by the
court pursuant to a hearing. When signed by a referee, the ex parte order becomes effective upon
the referee's signature. Upon request, a hearing, as provided by this section, shall be set. Except as
provided in paragraph (d), the respondent shall be personally served forthwith a copy of the ex parte
order along with a copy of the petition and, if requested by the petitioner, notice of the date set for
the hearing. If the petitioner does not request a hearing, an order served on a respondent under this
subdivision must include a notice advising the respondent of the right to request a hearing, must be
accompanied by a form that can be used by the respondent to request a hearing and must include
a conspicuous notice that a hearing will not be held unless requested by the respondent within five
days of service of the order.
    (d) Service of the ex parte order may be made by published notice, as provided under subdivision
5, provided that the petitioner files the affidavit required under that subdivision. If personal service is
not made or the affidavit is not filed within 14 days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
If the petitioner does not request a hearing, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if
known, must be accompanied by the form for requesting a hearing and notice described in paragraph
(c). Unless personal service is completed, if service by published notice is not completed within 28
days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
    (e) If the petitioner seeks relief under subdivision 6 other than the relief described in paragraph
(a), the petitioner must request a hearing to obtain the additional relief.
   (f) Nothing in this subdivision affects the right of a party to seek modification of an order under
subdivision 11.

this definition; or
   (8) any other circumstances that the domestic fatality review team decides fall within the

fatality review team. No two members may represent the same agency. Members representing
advocates or shelters must be selected by the advocacy community. At least one position must
be designated for a minority representative and one position must rotate in order to include an
advocate from the community in which the fatality under review took place.
   (c) The domestic fatality review team may also invite other relevant persons to serve on an ad
hoc basis and participate as full members of the review team for a particular review. These persons
may include, but are not limited to:
   (1) individuals with particular expertise that would be helpful to the review panel; or
    (2) representatives of organizations or agencies that had contact with or provided services to
the homicide victim, or to the alleged perpetrator, a victim who experienced or was threatened with
domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator, or a family member of one of those individuals.
   Subd. 4. Duties; access to data. (a) The domestic fatality review team shall collect, review, and
analyze death certificates and death data, including investigative reports, medical and counseling
records, victim service records, employment records, child abuse reports, or other information

the alleged perpetrator, or another victim who experienced or was threatened with domestic abuse
by the perpetrator; and child maltreatment records under section 626.556, relating to the victim or
a family or household member of the victim. Access to medical records under this paragraph also
includes records governed by sections 144.291 to 144.298.
   (c) As part of any review, the domestic fatality review team may compel the production of other
records by applying to the district court for a subpoena, which will be effective throughout the state
according to the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    Subd. 5. Confidentiality; data privacy. A person attending a domestic fatality review team
meeting may not disclose what transpired at the meeting, except to carry out the purposes of the
review team or as otherwise provided in this subdivision. The review team may disclose the names of
the victims in the cases it reviewed. The proceedings and records of the review team are confidential
data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 3, or protected nonpublic data as defined in section
13.02, subdivision 13, regardless of their classification in the hands of the person who provided
the data, and are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil or criminal action
against a professional, the state or a county agency, arising out of the matters the team is reviewing.
Information, documents, and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from
discovery or use in a civil or criminal action solely because they were presented during proceedings
of the review team. This section does not limit a person who presented information before the review
team or who is a member of the panel from testifying about matters within the person's knowledge.
However, in a civil or criminal proceeding, a person may not be questioned about the person's good
faith presentation of information to the review team or opinions formed by the person as a result of
the review team meetings.
    Subd. 6. Immunity. Members of the domestic fatality advisory board, members of the domestic
fatality review team, and members of each review panel, as well as their agents or employees, are
immune from claims and are not subject to any suits, liability, damages, or any other recourse, civil
or criminal, arising from any act, proceeding, decision, or determination undertaken or performed or
recommendation made by the domestic fatality review team, provided they acted in good faith and
without malice in carrying out their responsibilities. Good faith is presumed until proven otherwise
and the complainant has the burden of proving malice or a lack of good faith. No organization,
institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports, or records to the domestic
fatality review team as part of an investigation is civilly or criminally liable or subject to any other
recourse for providing the information.
    Subd. 7. Evaluation and report. (a) Each domestic fatality review team shall develop a system
for evaluating the effectiveness of its program and shall focus on identifiable goals and outcomes. An
evaluation must include data components as well as input from individuals involved in the review
process.

    Subd. 3. Notice, instructions, and exemption notice. If the levy is on funds of a judgment
debtor who is a natural person and if the funds to be levied are held on deposit at any financial
institution, the judgment creditor or its attorney shall provide the sheriff with a notice, instructions,
and two copies of an exemption notice, which must be substantially in the form set forth below. The
sheriff shall serve the notice, instructions, and both copies of the exemption notice on the financial
institution, along with the writ of execution. Failure of the sheriff to serve the notice, instructions,
and the exemption notices renders the levy void, and the financial institution shall take no action.
However, if this subdivision is being used to execute on funds that have previously been garnished in
compliance with section 571.71, the judgment creditor is not required to serve additional exemption
notices. In that event, the execution levy shall only be effective as to the funds that were subject to
the prior garnishment. Upon receipt of the writ of execution, notice, instructions, and exemption
notices, the financial institution shall retain as much of the amount due under section 550.04 as the
financial institution has on deposit owing to the judgment debtor, but not more than 110 percent of
the amount remaining due on the judgment.

   Subd. 3a. Form of notice. The notice required by subdivision 3 must be provided as a separate
form and must be substantially in the following form:
 STATE OF MINNESOTA                                                                                                  DISTRICT COURT

                                                        IMPORTANT NOTICE
                                            YOUR FUNDS HAVE BEEN LEVIED
     The Creditor has frozen money in your account at your financial institution.
     Your account balance is $.......
     The amount being held is $.......
     The amount being held will be frozen for 14 days from the date of this notice.
   Some of your money in your account may be protected (the legal word is exempt). You may
be able to get it sooner than 14 days if you act quickly and follow the instructions on the next
page.
   The attached exemption form lists some different sources of money in your account that may be
protected. If your money is from one or more of these sources, place a check on the line on the form
next to the sources of your money. If it is from one of these sources, the Creditor cannot take it.

    BUT, you must follow the instructions and return the exemption form and copies of your
bank statements from the last 60 days to have the bank unfreeze your money. If you do not follow
the instructions, your financial institution will give the money to the Sheriff. If that happens and it
is protected, you can still get it back from the Creditor later, but that is not as easy to do as filling
in the form now.
                        See next pages for instructions and the exemption form.
   Subd. 3b. Form of instructions. The instructions required by this section must be in a separate
form and must be substantially in the following form:
                                            INSTRUCTIONS
   Note: The creditor is who you owe the money to. You are the debtor.
   1. Fill out both of the attached exemption forms in this packet.
   If you check one of the lines, you should also give proof that shows that some or all of the
money in your account is from one or more of the protected sources. Creditors may ask for a
hearing if they question your exemptions. To avoid a hearing:
   Case numbers should be added to the form. Copies of documents should be sent with the
form.
    NOTICE: YOU MUST SEND TO THE CREDITOR'S ATTORNEY (OR TO THE
CREDITOR, IF NO ATTORNEY) COPIES OF YOUR BANK STATEMENTS FOR THE
PAST 60 DAYS BEFORE THE LEVY. Keep a copy of your bank statements in case there are
questions about your claim. If you do not send to the creditor's attorney (or to the creditor,
if no attorney) bank statements with your exemption claim, the financial institution may
release your money to the sheriff.
   2. Sign the exemption forms. Make one copy to keep for yourself.
   3. Mail or deliver the other copies of the form by (insert date).
   BOTH COPIES MUST BE MAILED OR DELIVERED THE SAME DAY.
   One copy of the form and the copies of your bank statements go to:
  .............................................................................
(Insert name of creditor or creditor's attorney)
  .............................................................................
(Insert address of creditor or creditor's attorney)

   One copy goes to:

(Insert address of bank)

                                             HOW THE PROCESS WORKS
   If You Do Not Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
    14 days after the date of this letter some or all of your money may be turned over to the creditor
or to the sheriff.
   If You Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
   Any money that is NOT protected can be turned over to the sheriff.
   If the Creditor Does Not Object:
   The financial institution will unfreeze your money six business days after the institution gets
your completed form.
   If the Creditor Objects:
   The money you have said is protected on the form will be held by the bank. The creditor has six
business days to object (disagree) and ask the court to hold a hearing. You will receive a Notice of
Objection and a Notice of Hearing.
   The financial institution will hold the money until a court decides whether your money is
protected or not. Some reasons a creditor may object are because you did not send copies of your
bank statements or other proof of the benefits you received. Be sure to include these when you
send your exemption form.
    You may want to talk to a lawyer for advice about this process. If you are low income you can
call Legal Aid.
   PENALTIES:
    If you claim that your money is protected and a court decides you made that claim in bad faith,
the court can order you to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up
to $100. For example, it may be bad faith if you claim you receive government benefits that you do
not receive.
   If the creditor made a bad faith objection to your claim that your money is protected, the court
can order them to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up to $100.

attorney for the judgment creditor, then the notice and bank statements must be sent directly to the
judgment creditor. Failure of the judgment debtor to deliver the executed exemption notice or copies

right to an exemption. Upon timely receipt of a claim of exemption, funds not claimed to be exempt

    Subd. 9. Release of funds. At any time during the procedure specified in this section, the
judgment debtor or the judgment creditor may, by a writing dated after the service of the execution,
direct the sheriff or the financial institution to release the funds in question to the other party. Upon
receipt of a release, the sheriff or the financial institution shall release the funds as directed.
    Subd. 10. Subsequent proceedings; bad faith claims. If in subsequent proceedings brought by
the judgment debtor or the judgment creditor, the claim of exemption is not upheld, and the court

$100. If the claim of exemption is upheld, and the court finds that the judgment creditor disregarded
the claim of exemption in bad faith, the judgment debtor shall be awarded costs, reasonable attorney
fees, actual damages, and an amount not to exceed $100. The underlying judgment must be modified
to reflect assessment of damages, costs, and attorney fees. However, if the party in whose favor a
penalty assessment is made is not actually indebted to the party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee
award shall be made directly to the attorney and, if not paid, an appropriate judgment in favor of the
attorney shall be entered. Upon motion of any party in interest, on notice, the court shall determine
the validity of any claim of exemption, and may make any order necessary to protect the rights of
those interested. No financial institution is liable for damages for complying with this section. Both
copies of an exemption claim or an objection to an exemption claim must be mailed or delivered on
the same date. The financial institution may rely on the date of mailing or delivery of a notice to it
in computing any time periods in this section.

levy void, and the financial institution shall take no action. However, if this subdivision is being

the execution levy shall only be effective as to the funds that were subject to the prior garnishment.

much of the amount due under section 550.04 as the financial institution has on deposit owing to
the judgment debtor, but not more than 100 percent of the amount remaining due on the judgment,
or $10,000, whichever is less.

                                                        IMPORTANT NOTICE
                                            YOUR FUNDS HAVE BEEN LEVIED
     The Creditor has frozen money in your account at your financial institution.
     Your account balance is $.......
     The amount being held is $.......
     The amount being held will be frozen for 14 days from the date of this notice.
   Some of your money in your account may be protected (the legal word is exempt). You may
be able to get it sooner than 14 days if you act quickly and follow the instructions on the next
page.
   The attached exemption form lists some different sources of money in your account that may be
protected. If your money is from one or more of these sources, place a check on the line on the form
next to the sources of your money. If it is from one of these sources, the Creditor cannot take it.
    BUT, you must follow the instructions and return the exemption form and copies of your
bank statements from the last 60 days to have the bank unfreeze your money. If you do not follow
the instructions, your financial institution will give the money to the Creditor. If that happens and it

is protected, you can still get it back from the Creditor later, but that is not as easy to do as filling
in the form now.
                        See next pages for instructions and the exemption form.
    Subd. 1c. Form of instructions. The instructions required must be in a separate form and must
be substantially in the following form:
                                            INSTRUCTIONS
   Note: The creditor is who you owe the money to. You are the debtor.
   1. Fill out both of the attached exemption forms in this packet.
   If you check one of the lines, you should also give proof that shows that some or all of the
money in your account is from one or more of the protected sources. Creditors may ask for a
hearing if they question your exemptions. To avoid a hearing:
   Case numbers should be added to the form. Copies of documents should be sent with the
form.
    NOTICE: YOU MUST SEND TO THE CREDITOR'S ATTORNEY (OR TO THE
CREDITOR, IF NO ATTORNEY) COPIES OF YOUR BANK STATEMENTS FOR THE
PAST 60 DAYS BEFORE THE LEVY. Keep a copy of your bank statements in case there are
questions about your claim. If you do not send to the creditor's attorney (or to the creditor,
if no attorney) bank statements with your exemption claim, the financial institution may
release your money to the creditor.
   2. Sign the exemption forms. Make one copy to keep for yourself.
   3. Mail or deliver the other copies of the form by (insert date).
   BOTH COPIES MUST BE MAILED OR DELIVERED THE SAME DAY.
   One copy of the form and the copies of your bank statements go to:
  .............................................................................
(Insert name of creditor or creditor's attorney)
  .............................................................................
(Insert address of creditor or creditor's attorney)

   One copy goes to:

                                   HOW THE PROCESS WORKS
33RD DAY]                                     TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2009                                        2055

     If You Do Not Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
   14 days after the date of this letter some or all of your money may be turned over to the creditor
pursuant to Minnesota statute.
     If You Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
     Any money that is NOT protected can be turned over to the creditor.
     If the Creditor Does Not Object:
   The financial institution will unfreeze your money six business days after the institution gets
your completed form.
     If the Creditor Objects:
   The money you have said is protected on the form will be held by the bank. The creditor has six
business days to object (disagree) and ask the court to hold a hearing. You will receive a Notice of
Objection and a Notice of Hearing.
   The financial institution will hold the money until a court decides whether your money is
protected or not. Some reasons a creditor may object are because you did not send copies of your
bank statements or other proof of the benefits you received. Be sure to include these when you
send your exemption form.
    You may want to talk to a lawyer for advice about this process. If you are low income you can
call Legal Aid.
     PENALTIES:
    If you claim that your money is protected and a court decides you made that claim in bad faith,
the court can order you to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up
to $100. For example, it may be bad faith if you claim you receive government benefits that you do
not receive.
   If the creditor made a bad faith objection to your claim that your money is protected, the court
can order them to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up to $100.

In the event that there is no attorney for the judgment creditor, the notice must be sent directly to

institution will retain the funds until it receives an order from the court or upon mutual agreement
between you and the creditor.

and reasonable attorney fees resulting from the additional proceedings, and an amount not to exceed
$100. If the claim of exemption is upheld, and the court finds that the judgment creditor disregarded
the claim of exemption in bad faith, the judgment debtor shall be awarded costs, reasonable attorney
fees, actual damages, and an amount not to exceed $100. The underlying judgment must be modified
to reflect assessment of damages, costs, and attorney fees. However, if the party in whose favor a

penalty assessment is made is not actually indebted to the party's attorney for fees, the attorney's fee
award shall be made directly to the attorney and if not paid, an appropriate judgment in favor of the
attorney shall be entered. Upon motion of any party in interest, on notice, the court shall determine
the validity of any claim of exemption, and may make any order necessary to protect the rights of
those interested. No financial institution is liable for damages for complying with this section. Both
copies of an exemption claim or an objection to an exemption claim must be mailed or delivered on
the same date. The financial institution may rely on the date of mailing or delivery of a notice to it
in computing any time periods in this section.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 571.71, is amended to read:
   571.71 GARNISHMENT; WHEN AUTHORIZED.
   As an ancillary proceeding to a civil action for the recovery of money, a creditor may issue a
garnishment summons as provided in this chapter against any third party in the following instances:
    (1) at the time the civil action is commenced or at any time after the commencement of the
civil action, but before the entry of a judgment, if the court orders the issuance of the garnishment
summons pursuant to section 571.93;
    (2) at any time ­40
                      ­ 45 days or more after service of the summons and complaint upon the debtor
in the civil action when a judgment by default could have, but has not, been entered pursuant to rule
55.01(a) of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts. Garnishment under this
clause is effective only after the Notice of Intent to Garnish form in section 571.72, subdivision 11,
and the Exemption form in section 571.72, subdivision 10, are served on the debtor at any time 20
or more days after the service of the Summons and Complaint and, in addition, the creditor does not
receive an Answer from the debtor within 25 days after service of the Notice of Intent to Garnish.
The Notice of Intent to Garnish form and the Exemption form must be substantially in the form set
forth in section 571.72, subdivisions 10 and 11. If a creditor sends a Notice of Intent to Garnish
form to a debtor under this clause, the creditor cannot obtain a default judgment against the debtor
under rule 55.01(a) of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Court until 25 days
after the service of the Notice of Intent to Garnish form. No filing of a pleading or other documents
by the creditor is required to issue a garnishment summons under this clause; however, the creditor
must comply with the service requirement of section 571.72, subdivision 4; or
   (3) at any time after entry of a money judgment in the civil action.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 571.72, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 10. Exemption notice for prejudgment garnishment.
                                        EXEMPTION NOTICE
    IMPORTANT NOTICE: A garnishment summons may be served on your employer, bank,
or other third parties without any further court proceeding or notice to you. See the attached
Notice of Intent to Garnish for more information.
   The following money and wages may be protected (the legal word is exempt) from
garnishment:

   Sending the creditor's attorney (or creditor, if no attorney) a copy of BANK

creditor enough information about your exemption claim to avoid a garnishment.
   2. Earnings

   All of your earnings (wages) may be protected if:
   You get government benefits (see list of government benefits)

    You have received government benefits in the last six months
    You were in jail or prison in the last six months
    Your wages are only protected for 60 days after they are deposited in your account so it would
be helpful if you immediately send the undersigned creditor a copy of BANK STATEMENTS
that show what was in your account for the past 60 days.
    Some of your earnings (wages) may be protected if:
    If all of your earnings are not exempt, some of your earnings may still be protected for 20 days
after they were deposited in your account. The amount protected is the larger amount of:
    75 percent of your wages (after taxes are taken out); or

    YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CLAIM THESE EXEMPTIONS WHEN YOU RECEIVE
A NOTICE. You will get the notice at least ten days BEFORE a wage garnishment. BUT
if the creditor garnishes your bank account, you will not get the notice until AFTER the
account has been frozen. IF YOU BELIEVE THE MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
OR YOUR WAGES ARE EXEMPT, YOU SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE
PERSON BELOW. YOU SHOULD TELL THEM WHY YOU THINK YOUR ACCOUNT
OR WAGES ARE EXEMPT TO SEE IF YOU CAN AVOID GARNISHMENT.

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 571.72, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Notice of intent to garnish. The notice of intent to garnish must be in substantially
the following form:
                                         IMPORTANT! READ THIS CAREFULLY!

                                           NOTICE OF INTENT TO GARNISH
  .................................                     against      ..................................................................
                                   Plaintiff/Creditor                Defendant/Debtor

   Your money, property, or earnings are in danger of being garnished because you did not
send a written "Answer" to the Summons and Complaint served on you over 20 days ago.
   There may not be a case filed in court, BUT because you did not send a written "Answer" the
creditor may serve a garnishment summons on your employer, bank, or other third parties. This
means that your money or wages can be garnished (held or taken). Under Minnesota law, this can
happen any time 20 days after the date you receive this notice.
   There will be NO COURT HEARING or any further notice to you prior to a garnishment if
you do nothing. There may not be a file open at the Clerk of the Court's office. There are things
you can do to avoid a garnishment, but you must act quickly.
    Please read these instructions carefully. You have 20 days to do one of the following:
     1. Send an Answer. If you do not think you owe the money or if you have a legal reason that
you did not pay, send a written "Answer" to the Summons and Complaint. Your "Answer" should
tell the creditor why you think you do not owe some or all of the money. Contact a lawyer if you do
not know what to do, need help with an answer, or have any questions about the debt.
   2. Claim an Exemption. Even if you do not have a defense to the complaint, some of your
money may be protected (the legal word is exempt) from garnishment. This means it is protected
and cannot be taken. The creditor will send you a form to claim these exemptions at a later time,
but you can possibly avoid the garnishment by contacting the person below immediately to claim
your exemption. Attached to this notice is a list of exemptions you may be able to claim.
   3. If you do not have a defense and your money is not exempt you can call the person below
before the 20 days are up and try to set up a payment plan that works for both you and your creditor.
You can contact the person below at any time to try to work out a payment plan, but if you wait too
long or cannot agree on a payment plan, they may garnish your wages, bank accounts, or assets.
   If you do not do any of these things, your money can be garnished. The creditor can garnish
your wages, bank accounts, or other assets. They do not have to go to court to let you know when
they start taking your money.

    571.911 EXEMPTION NOTICE; DUTY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.
    If the garnishment summons is used to garnish funds of a debtor who is a natural person and
if the funds to be garnished are held on deposit at a financial institution, the creditor shall serve
with the garnishee summons a notice, instructions, and two copies of an exemption notice. The
notice, instructions, and exemption notices must be substantially in the ­   f­
                                                                              o­rm

section 571.912. Failure of the creditor to send the exemption notice renders the garnishment void,
and the financial institution shall take no action. Upon receipt of the garnishment summons and
exemption notices, the financial institution shall retain as much of the amount under section 571.73
as the financial institution has on deposit owing to the debtor, but not more than 110 percent of the
creditor's claim.

                                                      IMPORTANT NOTICE
                                      YOUR FUNDS HAVE BEEN GARNISHED
    The Creditor has frozen money in your account at your financial institution.
    Your account balance is $.......
    The amount being held is $.......
    The amount being held will be frozen for 14 days from the date of this notice.
   Some of your money in your account may be protected (the legal word is exempt). You may
be able to get it sooner than 14 days if you act quickly and follow the instructions on the next
page.
2068                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [33RD DAY

   The attached exemption form lists some different sources of money in your account that may be
protected. If your money is from one or more of these sources, place a check on the line on the form
next to the sources of your money. If it is from one of these sources, the Creditor cannot take it.
    BUT, you must follow the instructions and return the exemption form and copies of your
bank statements from the last 60 days to have the bank unfreeze your money. If you do not follow
the instructions or your Creditor gets an order from the court or writ of execution, your financial
institution will give the money to your Creditor. If that happens and it is protected, you can still get
it back from the Creditor later, but that is not as easy to do as filling in the form now.
                        See next pages for instructions and the exemption form.
    Subd. 2. Form of instructions. The instructions required must be in a separate form and must
be substantially in the following form:
                                           INSTRUCTIONS
   Note: The creditor is who you owe the money to. You are the debtor.
   1. Fill out both of the attached exemption forms in this packet.
   If you check one of the lines, you should also give proof that shows that some or all of the
money in your account is from one or more of the protected sources. Creditors may ask for a
hearing if they question your exemptions.
   To avoid a hearing:
   Case numbers should be added to the form.
   Copies of documents should be sent with the form.
    NOTICE: YOU MUST SEND TO THE CREDITOR'S ATTORNEY (OR TO THE
CREDITOR, IF NO ATTORNEY) COPIES OF YOUR BANK STATEMENTS FOR THE
PAST 60 DAYS BEFORE THE GARNISHMENT. Keep a copy of your bank statements
in case there are questions about your claim. If you do not send to the creditor's attorney
(or to the creditor, if no attorney) bank statements with your exemption claim, the financial
institution may release your money to the creditor once the creditor gives the financial
institution a court order directing it to turn over the funds.
   2. Sign the exemption forms. Make one copy to keep for yourself.
   3. Mail or deliver the other copies of the form by (insert date).
   BOTH COPIES MUST BE MAILED OR DELIVERED THE SAME DAY.
   One copy of the form and the copies of your bank statements go to:
 .............................................................................
(Insert name of creditor or creditor's attorney)
 .............................................................................
(Insert address of creditor or creditor's attorney)

   One copy goes to:

(Insert name of bank)

(Insert address of bank)

                                  HOW THE PROCESS WORKS
   If You Do Not Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
   14 days after the date of this letter some or all of your money may be turned over to the creditor
once they get an order from the court telling the financial institution to do this.
   If You Send in the Exemption Form and Bank Statements:
    Any money that is NOT protected can be turned over to the creditor once they get an order from
the court.
   If the Creditor Does Not Object:
   The financial institution will unfreeze your money six business days after the institution gets
your completed form.
   If the Creditor Objects:
   The money you have said is protected on the form will be held by the bank. The creditor has six
business days to object (disagree) and ask the court to hold a hearing. You will receive a Notice of
Objection and a Notice of Hearing.
   The financial institution will hold the money until a court decides whether your money is
protected or not. Some reasons a creditor may object are because you did not send copies of your
bank statements or other proof of the benefits you received. Be sure to include these when you
send your exemption form.
    You may want to talk to a lawyer for advice about this process. If you are low income you can
call Legal Aid.
   PENALTIES:
    If you claim that your money is protected and a court decides you made that claim in bad faith,
the court can order you to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up
to $100. For example, it may be bad faith if you claim you receive government benefits that you do
not receive.
   If the creditor made a bad faith objection to your claim that your money is protected, the court
can order them to pay costs, actual damages, attorney fees, and an additional amount of up to $100.
   Subd. 3. Exemption notice. The exemption notice must be a separate form and must be in
substantially the following form:

   If you wish to claim an exemption, you should fill out the appropriate form below, sign it, and
send it to the creditor's attorney and the garnishee.
   You may wish to contact the attorney for the creditor in order to arrange for a settlement of the
debt or contact an attorney to advise you about exemptions or other rights.
                                                     PENALTIES
        (1) Be advised that even if you claim an exemption, a garnishment summons may still be
        served on your employer. If your earnings are garnished after you claim an exemption, you
        may petition the court for a determination of your exemption. If the court finds that the
        creditor disregarded your claim of exemption in bad faith, you will be entitled to costs,
        reasonable attorney fees, actual damages, and an amount not to exceed $100.
        (2) HOWEVER, BE WARNED if you claim an exemption, the creditor can also petition
        the court for a determination of your exemption, and if the court finds that you claimed an
        exemption in bad faith, you will be assessed costs and reasonable attorney's fees plus an
        amount not to exceed $100.
        (3) If after receipt of this notice, you in bad faith take action to frustrate the garnishment,
        thus requiring the creditor to petition the court to resolve the problem, you will be liable to
        the creditor for costs and reasonable attorney's fees plus an amount not to exceed $100.

have filed a consent to disclosure with the commissioner of health and neither consent to disclosure
has been revoked by the subsequent filing by a parent of an affidavit stating that the information
should not be disclosed. If only one parent has filed a consent to disclosure and the consent has not
been revoked, the commissioner of health shall disclose, to the adopted person, original birth record
information on the consenting parent only.
    (b) If the person was adopted before August 1, 1977, and the only contact with a birth parent
under this section was by certified mail, the commissioner of health must not disclose information
on that parent in the adopted person's original birth record unless that parent has filed an unrevoked
consent to disclosure with the commissioner."

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 617.87, is amended to read:
   617.87 RELEASE OF PROPERTY.
    If, after an order of abatement has been entered, the owner appears and pays the costs of the
action and files a bond in an amount determined by the court, but not to exceed $50,000, conditioned
that the owner will immediately abate the nuisance for a period of one year, the court may, if satisfied
of the owner's good faith, order the release of the building or portion of it which is subject to the
order of abatement. If the building or portion of it that is subject to the order of abatement is a
hotel, motel, or similar establishment that rents overnight lodging to the public and the nuisance
was prostitution or prostitution-related activity that involved sex trafficking, as defined in section
609.321, subdivision 7a, the release must require the owner to post a notice in the form specified in
section 340A.5055 in each unit and portion of the building that was subject to the order of abatement.
If the premises are released, for each day during the term of the bond that the owner knowingly
permits any part of the premises to be used for any activity which was the basis of the abatement
order or fails to post the notice, if required, the owner shall forfeit $1,000 under the bond. Forfeiture
under the bond does not relieve the owner from prosecution for contempt. Release of the property
pursuant to this section does not release it from an injunction issued under section 617.83 or any
other judgment, penalty, lien, or liability to which it may be subject by law.
