four-, and five-year-olds;
   (iv) the role of the medical community in screening;
   (v) incentives for parents to have children screened at an earlier age;
    (vi) incentives for early education and care providers to comprehensively assess children in order
to improve instructional practice;
   (vii) how to phase in increases in screening and assessment over time;
    (viii) how the screening and assessment data will be collected and used and who will have access
to the data;
    (ix) how to monitor progress toward the goal of having 50 percent of three-year-old children
screened and 50 percent of five-year-old children assessed for school readiness by 2015 and 100
percent of three-year-old children screened and five-year-old children assessed for school readiness
by 2020;
    (x) how to monitor progress toward the goal of having 50 percent of four-year-old children
assessed by their early childhood education and care providers to determine their level of
performance in order to promote their learning and development; and
   (xi) costs to meet these benchmarks.
The council shall consider the screening instruments and comprehensive assessment tools used in
Minnesota early childhood education and care programs and kindergarten. The council may survey
early childhood education and care programs in the state to determine the screening and assessment
tools being used or rely on previously collected survey data, if available.
   (b) For purposes of this subdivision:
     (1) "school readiness" is defined as the child's skills, knowledge, and behaviors at kindergarten
entrance in these areas of child development: social; self-regulation; cognitive, including language,
literacy, and mathematical thinking; and physical;
   (2) "screening" is defined as the activities used to identify a child who may need further
evaluation to determine delay in development or disability; and
   (3) "assessment" is defined as the activities used to determine a child's level of performance in
order to promote the child's learning and development.
    (c) Any costs incurred by the council in making recommendations under paragraph (a), clause
(5), must be paid from nonstate and nonfederal funds appropriated to the council under subdivision
3. If no nonstate or nonfederal funds are received, the council may not proceed in making
recommendations under paragraph (a), clause (5). The council shall report its recommendations
under this subdivision, including draft legislation necessary to implement the recommendations,
to the governor and the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees and
divisions with jurisdiction over early childhood education policy and finance no later than July 1,
2012, with interim reports on February 15, 2011, and February 15, 2012.

   Senator Sieben moved to amend H.F. No. 655, as amended pursuant to Rule 45, adopted by the
Senate April 12, 2010, as follows:

   (The text of the amended House File is identical to S.F. No. 531.)
   Page 2, after line 4, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Laws 2010, chapter 194, section 9, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Duties of ballot board; absentee ballots. (a) The members of the ballot board shall
take possession of all return envelopes delivered to them in accordance with section 203B.08. Upon
receipt from the county auditor, municipal clerk, or school district clerk, two or more members
of the ballot board shall examine each return envelope and shall mark it accepted or rejected in
the manner provided in this subdivision. Election judges performing the duties in this section must
be of different major political parties, unless they are exempt from that requirement under section
205.075, subdivision 4, or section 205A.10, subdivision 2.
    (b) The members of the ballot board shall mark the return envelope "Accepted" and initial or
sign the return envelope below the word "Accepted" if a majority of the members of the ballot board
examining the envelope are satisfied that:
    (1) the voter's name and address on the return envelope are the same as the information provided
on the absentee ballot application;
   (2) the voter signed the certification on the envelope;
    (3) the voter's Minnesota driver's license, state identification number, or the last four digits of
the voter's Social Security number are the same as the number provided on the voter's application
for ballots. If the number does not match the number as submitted on the application, or if a number
was not submitted on the application, the election judges must compare the signature provided by
the applicant to determine whether the ballots were returned by the same person to whom they were
transmitted;
   (4) the voter is registered and eligible to vote in the precinct or has included a properly completed
voter registration application in the return envelope; ญ  an
                                                           ญญd
    (5) the certificate has been completed as prescribed in the directions for casting an absentee
ballot; and
   (6) the voter has not already voted at that election, either in person or, if it is after the close of
business on the fourth day before the election, by absentee ballot.
   The return envelope from accepted ballots must be preserved and returned to the county auditor.
    (c)(1) If a majority of the members of the ballot board examining a return envelope find that an
absentee voter has failed to meet one of the requirements provided in paragraph (b), they shall mark
the return envelope "Rejected," initial or sign it below the word "Rejected," list the reason for the
rejection on the envelope, and return it to the county auditor. There is no other reason for rejecting an
absentee ballot beyond those permitted by this section. Failure to place the ballot within the security
envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject an absentee ballot.
   (2) If an envelope has been rejected at least five days before the election, the envelope must
remain sealed and the official in charge of the ballot board shall provide the voter with a replacement
absentee ballot and return envelope in place of the rejected ballot.

    (3) If an envelope is rejected within five days of the election, the envelope must remain sealed
and the official in charge of the ballot board must attempt to contact the voter by telephone or e-mail
to notify the voter that the voter's ballot has been rejected. The official must document the attempts
made to contact the voter.
    (d) The official in charge of the absentee ballot board must mail the voter a written notice of
absentee ballot rejection between six and ten weeks following the election. If the official determines
that the voter has otherwise cast a ballot in the election, no notice is required. If an absentee ballot
arrives after the deadline for submission provided by this chapter, the notice must be provided
between six to ten weeks after receipt of the ballot. A notice of absentee ballot rejection must contain
the following information:
   (1) the date on which the absentee ballot was rejected or, if the ballot was received after the
required deadline for submission, the date on which the ballot was received;
   (2) the reason for rejection; and
   (3) the name of the appropriate election official to whom the voter may direct further questions,
along with appropriate contact information.
    (e) An absentee ballot return envelope marked "Rejected" may not be opened or subject to further
review except in an election contest filed pursuant to chapter 209.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 25, 2010."

mentally ill and dangerous and who is confined at a secure treatment facility or has been transferred
out of a state-operated services facility according to section 253B.18, subdivision 6, shall not be
released on a pass unless the pass is part of a pass plan that has been approved by the medical
director of the secure treatment facility. The pass plan must have a specific therapeutic purpose
consistent with the treatment plan, must be established for a specific period of time, and must have
specific levels of liberty delineated. The county case manager must be invited to participate in the
development of the pass plan. At least ten days prior to a determination on the plan, the medical
director shall notify the designated agency, the committing court, the county attorney of the county
of commitment, an interested person, the local law enforcement agency where the facility is located,
the county attorney and the local law enforcement agency in the location where the pass is to occur,
the petitioner, and the petitioner's counsel of the plan, the nature of the passes proposed, and their
right to object to the plan. If any notified person objects prior to the proposed date of implementation,
the person shall have an opportunity to appear, personally or in writing, before the medical director,
within ten days of the objection, to present grounds for opposing the plan. The pass plan shall
not be implemented until the objecting person has been furnished that opportunity. Nothing in this
subdivision shall be construed to give a patient an affirmative right to a pass plan."
