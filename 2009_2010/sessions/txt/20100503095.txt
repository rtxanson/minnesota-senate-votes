annuity, disability benefit, or survivor benefit recipients of the State Patrol retirement plan are
entitled to a postretirement adjustment annually on January 1, as follows:
    (1) a postretirement increase of 1.5 percent must be applied each year, effective on January 1,
to the monthly annuity or benefit of each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an
annuity or a benefit for at least 18 full months before the January 1 increase; and
    (2) for each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or a benefit for at
least six full months, an annual postretirement increase of 1/12 of 1.5 percent for each month that
the person has been receiving an annuity or benefit must be applied, effective January 1, following
the calendar year in which the person has been retired for at least six months, but has been retired
for less than 18 months.
    (b) The increases provided by this subdivision commence on January 1, 2011. Increases under
this subdivision for the State Patrol retirement plan terminate on December 31 of the calendar year in
which the actuarial valuation prepared by the approved actuary under sections 356.214 and 356.215
and the standards for actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement indicates that the market value of assets of the retirement plan equals or exceeds 90
percent of the actuarial accrued liability of the retirement plan and increases under subdivision 1
recommence after that date.
   (c) An increase in annuity or benefit payments under this subdivision must be made automatically
unless written notice is filed by the annuitant or benefit recipient with the executive director of the
applicable covered retirement plan requesting that the increase not be made.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 81. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 356.415, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:

annually by the approved actuary under sections 356.214 and 356.215 and the standards for
actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement, indicate
that the market value of assets of the applicable covered plans equals or exceeds 90 percent of the
actuarial accrued liabilities, the actuarial valuation reports must utilize a post-retirement interest
rate assumption that is equal to the difference between the pre-retirement interest rate assumption
provided in section 356.215, subdivision 8, and the stated annual post-retirement adjustment rate
provided under this section, as applicable to each covered plan.

annuity, disability benefit, or survivor benefit recipients of the State Patrol retirement plan are
entitled to a postretirement adjustment annually on January 1, as follows:
    (1) a postretirement increase of 1.5 percent must be applied each year, effective on January 1,
to the monthly annuity or benefit of each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an
annuity or a benefit for at least 18 full months before the January 1 increase; and
    (2) for each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or a benefit for at
least six full months, an annual postretirement increase of 1/12 of 1.5 percent for each month that
the person has been receiving an annuity or benefit must be applied, effective January 1, following
the calendar year in which the person has been retired for at least six months, but has been retired
for less than 18 months.
    (b) The increases provided by this subdivision commence on January 1, 2011. Increases under
this subdivision for the State Patrol retirement plan terminate on December 31 of the calendar year in
which the actuarial valuation prepared by the approved actuary under sections 356.214 and 356.215
and the standards for actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement indicates that the market value of assets of the retirement plan equals or exceeds 90
percent of the actuarial accrued liability of the retirement plan and increases under subdivision 1
recommence after that date.
   (c) An increase in annuity or benefit payments under this subdivision must be made automatically

actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement, indicate
that the market value of assets of the applicable covered plans equals or exceeds 90 percent of the
actuarial accrued liabilities, the actuarial valuation reports must utilize a post-retirement interest

The commissioner may restructure the schedule of payments between the state and participating
counties under the local agency share and division of cost provisions under section 254B.03,
subdivisions 3 and 4, as necessary to facilitate the operation of the pilot projects.
    (d) To the extent that state fiscal year expenditures within a pilot project are less than the expected
share of forecasted expenditures in the absence of the pilot projects, the commissioner shall deposit
the unexpended funds in a separate account within the consolidated chemical dependency treatment
fund, and make these funds available for expenditure by the pilot projects the following year. To the
extent that treatment and nontreatment pilot services expenditures within the pilot project exceed
the amount expected in the absence of the pilot projects, the pilot project county or counties are

implementation of the pilot project, except that any chemical dependency treatment funded under
this section must continue to be provided by a licensed treatment provider.
   (f) The commissioner shall not approve or enter into any agreement related to pilot projects
authorized under this section that puts current or future federal funding at risk.

of a mortgage to which section 580.021 applies.
    (b) Sections 583.40 to 583.47 do not apply to property if the holder of the mortgage, before
selling the property to the owner, occupied the property as the holder's principal place of residency.
    Subd. 2. Mortgagors. Sections 583.40 to 583.47 apply to a mortgagor who has received
foreclosure prevention counseling under section 580.021 and who has been verified as eligible for
mediation by an authorized foreclosure prevention counseling agency, or who files a mediation

of this clause, whether a potential loan modification would result in a debt-to-income ratio that is
within the traditional secondary market loan qualification guidelines established by Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac must be considered.

all known mortgagees with debts secured by the property. A mortgagor who fails to send a timely
mediation request accompanied by the fee waives the right to mediation under sections 583.40 to
583.47 for that specific mortgage foreclosure. Upon receipt of a mediation request affidavit, the
office must send a copy of the affidavit to the holder of the mortgage. The holder of the mortgage
must not commence a foreclosure proceeding against the property or proceed with a proceeding
to which paragraph (b) applies until the stay of the foreclosure is lifted or as otherwise authorized
under sections 583.40 to 583.47.
    (b) If a mortgagor did not receive the preforeclosure prevention counseling and mediation notice
required under section 580.021 and a mortgage foreclosure proceeding has been commenced against
the mortgagor's property, the mortgagor may send the mediation request affidavit to the office at any
time before the time when the initial public notice contained in section 580.03 must be given. The
mediation request affidavit must indicate that the mortgagor has not received the required notice.
   (c) The office must combine all mediation requests for the same mortgagor that are received
before the initial mediation meeting into one mediation proceeding.
    (d) The mortgagor is only entitled to a single mediation proceeding for a specific mortgage
foreclosure. In the event a mortgage is modified through the mediation process contained in sections
583.40 to 583.47, that mortgage is not eligible for mediation if the modified mortgage becomes the
subject of a subsequent foreclosure proceeding.
   Subd. 2. Assignment of mediator; costs. (a) The chief administrative law judge of the office
shall assign an administrative law judge, staff attorney, or other person with mediation training to
conduct the mediation.
   (b) The office shall provide the parties with a schedule of fees to be charged by administrative
law judges, staff attorneys, or other persons who act as mediators. The parties are responsible for
paying the costs of the mediation. The costs of mediation must be covered by the mediation fees
submitted by the parties. After the initial fees are expended, additional mediation meetings may be
held as agreed to and paid for by the participating parties.
    Subd. 3. Mediation proceeding notice. (a) Within ten days after receiving a mediation request,
the mediator must send:
   (1) a mediation proceeding notice to the mortgagor; and

   (2) a mediation proceeding notice to the mortgagee's agent listed by the mortgagee in the form
submitted under section 580.021, subdivision 4, paragraph (b).
   (b) The mediation proceeding notice must disclose:
   (1) the name and address of the mortgagor;
   (2) that the mortgagor has requested mediation under sections 583.40 to 583.47;
   (3) the time and place for the initial mediation meeting;
    (4) that sections 583.40 to 583.47 do not prohibit the mortgagee from continuing the foreclosure
proceeding up through, but not including, the time when the initial published notice contained
in section 580.03 must be given but the mortgagee must not publish the initial notice, except as
otherwise allowed under sections 583.40 to 583.47;
    (5) that by the initial mediation meeting, the mortgagee must provide the mortgagor with a copy
of the mortgage and note, a statement of interest rates on the debt, delinquent payments, unpaid
principal and interest balances, the mortgagee's estimate of value of the property, and a general
description of the debt restructuring programs available from the mortgagee;
    (6) that by the initial mediation meeting, the mortgagor must provide the mortgagee and the
mediator with full documentation of the mortgagor's income and financial obligations and disclose
all known mortgages with debts secured by the property; and
    (7) that by the initial meeting, the mortgagee or mortgagees must each submit a mediation fee
of $160 to the office.
    (c) Before the initial meeting, a mortgagor and mortgagee must provide the information specified
in paragraph (b), clause (5) or (6), and the mortgagee must submit the filing fee specified in paragraph
(b), clause (7). An initial mediation meeting must be held within 30 days of the mediation proceeding
notice. Mediation meetings must be conducted at a location that is within 100 miles of the mortgaged
premises that is the subject of the mediation. At the initial mediation meeting, the mediator shall
determine whether or not there is a reasonable likelihood that the mortgagor could afford a modified
loan.
   Subd. 4. Effect of mediation proceeding notice. (a) Sections 583.40 to 583.47 do not prevent
a mortgagee from continuing the foreclosure proceeding up through, but not including, the time
when the initial published notice contained in section 580.03 must be given. A mortgagee must not
publish the initial notice, except as otherwise allowed under sections 583.40 to 583.47.
   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a mortgagee receiving a mediation proceeding notice may
commence or continue a mortgage foreclosure proceeding against the property if:
    (1) the mortgagee receives a mediator's affidavit of the mortgagor's lack of good faith under
section 583.43;
    (2) ten days have expired since the parties signed an unrevoked agreement under subdivision 8
allowing the mortgagee to commence mortgage foreclosure proceedings against the property; or
   (3) the mortgagee receives a termination statement under subdivision 9.

   (c) The provisions of this subdivision are subject to section 583.43, relating to extensions or
reductions in the period before a mortgagee may commence or continue a mortgage foreclosure
proceeding.
   Subd. 5. Mediator duties. (a) At all mediation meetings, the mediator shall:
   (1) attempt to mediate between the parties;
   (2) advise the parties of assistance programs that are available;
   (3) attempt to arrive at an agreement to fairly adjust, refinance, or pay the mortgage debt; and
   (4) advise, counsel, and assist the parties in attempting to arrive at an agreement for the future
conduct of financial relations between them.
    (b) The mediator may determine the format of the mediation meetings, including whether or not
to keep the parties separate.
    Subd. 6. Mediator immunity. The office and mediators are immune from civil liability for
actions within the scope of their positions under this chapter. The office and mediators do not have a
duty to advise the parties about the law or to encourage or assist parties regarding their legal rights.
This subdivision is in addition to and not a limitation of immunity that otherwise exists under law.
    Subd. 7. Mediation period. The mediator may call mediation meetings during the mediation
period, which may be up to 60 days after the mortgagor sends a mediation request to the office.
   Subd. 8. Mediation agreement. (a) If an agreement is reached among the parties, the mediator

applicable, submit the agreement to (1) the office, and (2) any court that has jurisdiction over
mortgage foreclosure or redemption proceedings regarding the property.
   (b) The parties to the approved mediation agreement:
   (1) are bound by the terms of the agreement; and
   (2) may enforce the mediation agreement as a legal contract.
    (c) A mortgagor may agree to allow a mortgagee to commence a mortgage foreclosure
proceeding against property that is subject to mediation before the proceeding is otherwise allowed
under subdivision 4, provided that the parties may rescind the agreement within five business days
after both parties sign the agreement.
    Subd. 9. Termination of mediation. (a) The mediator must sign and serve on the parties an
affidavit by the end of the mediation period.

    (d) Within three business days after the end of mediation, the mediator must forward the affidavit
under paragraph (b) for recording with the county recorder or registrar of titles of the county where
the property is located. The filed affidavit is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
    Subd. 10. Disposition of fees. Mediation fees collected by the office under this section must be
deposited in the administrative hearings account in the state treasury and are appropriated to the
office for purposes of this section.
   Sec. 8. [583.43] GOOD FAITH REQUIRED.
   Subdivision 1. Obligation of good faith. The parties must engage in mediation in good faith.
Not participating in good faith includes:
   (1) failure to attend and participate in mediation sessions without cause;
    (2) failure to provide full information, including the obligation to provide information under
section 583.42, subdivision 3;
   (3) failure of the mortgagee to designate an agent to participate in the mediation with authority
to make binding commitments;
    (4) lack of a written statement of debt restructuring alternatives and a statement of reasons why
alternatives are unacceptable to one of the parties; and
   (5) other similar behavior that evidences lack of good faith by a party. A failure to agree to
reduce, restructure, refinance, or forgive debt is not, in itself, evidence of lack of good faith by the
mortgagee. Nothing in sections 583.40 to 583.47 requires a mortgagee to modify the debt that is the
subject of the foreclosure proceeding.
    Subd. 2. Party's bad faith; mediator's affidavit. If the mediator determines that either party
is not participating in good faith as defined in subdivision 1, the mediator must file an affidavit
indicating the reasons for the finding with the office and with parties to the mediation.
    Subd. 3. Mortgagee's bad faith. If the mediator finds that the mortgagee has not participated
in the mediation in good faith, and the mortgagee continues with the foreclosure proceeding, the
mortgagor is allowed a six-month redemption period.
     Subd. 4. Mortgagor's lack of good faith. If the mediator finds that the mortgagor has not
participated in the mediation in good faith, and the mortgagee continues with the foreclosure
proceeding, then the mortgagor shall execute a deed in lieu of foreclosure within 90 days of the
filing of the mediator's affidavit containing the finding of bad faith.
   Sec. 9. [583.44] DATA PRACTICES.
   Data on mortgagors created, collected, and maintained by the office or bureau under sections
583.40 to 583.47 are private data on individuals as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12.
   Sec. 10. [583.45] MEDIATION REQUEST AFFIDAVIT FORM.
    The affidavit for requesting mediation under section 583.42 must be in substantially the
following form:

   S.F. No. 214, which the committee recommends to pass with the following amendment offered
by Senator Dille:
    Page 11, after line 3, insert:
   "Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 1b. Term of license; fee; premarital education. (a) The local registrar shall examine
upon oath the parties applying for a license relative to the legality of the contemplated marriage.
If one party is unable to appear in person, the party appearing may complete the absent applicant's
information. The local registrar shall provide a copy of the marriage application to the party who is
unable to appear, who must verify the accuracy of the party's information in a notarized statement.
The marriage license must not be released until the verification statement has been received by
the local registrar. If at the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal
impediment to it, including the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue
the license, containing the full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state
of residence, with the county seal attached, and make a record of the date of issuance. The license
shall be valid for a period of six months. Except as provided in paragraph (c), the local registrar
10116                                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                [95TH DAY

shall collect from the applicant a fee of $110 for administering the oath, issuing, recording, and
filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics the
reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period of
six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of the
county in which the application is made may authorize the license to be issued at any time before
expiration of the five-day period required under paragraph (a). A waiver of the five-day waiting
period must be in the following form:
    STATE OF MINNESOTA, COUNTY OF .................... (insert county name)
    APPLICATION FOR WAIVER OF MARRIAGE LICENSE WAITING PERIOD:
    ................................................................................. (legal names of the applicants)
    Represent and state as follows:
   That on ......................... (date of application) the applicants applied to the local registrar of the
above-named county for a license to marry.
    That it is necessary that the license be issued before the expiration of five days from the date of
the application by reason of the following: (insert reason for requesting waiver of waiting period)
    .............................................................................................................
    .............................................................................................................

    After reviewing the above application, I am satisfied that an emergency or extraordinary
circumstance exists that justifies the issuance of the marriage license before the expiration of
five days from the date of the application. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the local registrar is
authorized and directed to issue the license forthwith.
    .....................................................
    ................................ (judge of district court)
    ................................ (date).
    (c) The marriage license fee for parties who have completed at least 12 hours of premarital
education is $40. In order to qualify for the reduced license fee, the parties must submit at the time
of applying for the marriage license a statement that is signed, dated, and notarized or marked with
               s­a
a church seal, ­t­­e ­­
                   t­m en
                        ­­t from the person who provided the premarital education on their letterhead
confirming that it was received. The premarital education must be provided by a licensed or ordained
minister or the minister's designee, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18,
or a person authorized to practice marriage and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education
must include the use of a premarital inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict
management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)
received at least 12 hours of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory
and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request."

contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July

in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
      (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. T       ­h­­e­­p­­ro

A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods for contract
years starting in 2012, the commissioner must consider the methods used to determine county

allocations for home and community-based program participants. If necessary to reduce MnDHO
rates to comply with the provision regarding MnDHO costs for home and community-based
services, the commissioner shall achieve the reduction by maintaining the base rate for contract
years 2010 and 2011 for services provided under the community alternatives for disabled
individuals waiver at the same level as for contract year 2009. The commissioner may apply other
reductions to MnDHO rates to implement decreases in provider payment rates required by state
law. In developing program specifications for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner
shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph
(d), including consultation on whether and how to include home and community-based waiver
programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the
house of representatives and senate committees with jurisdiction over health and human services
policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.

    Subdivision 1. Emergency hold. (a) Any person may be admitted or held for emergency care and
treatment in a treatment facility, except to a facility operated by the Minnesota sex offender program,
with the consent of the head of the treatment facility upon a written statement by an examiner that:
    (1) the examiner has examined the person not more than 15 days prior to admission;
   (2) the examiner is of the opinion, for stated reasons, that the person is mentally ill,
developmentally disabled, or chemically dependent, and is in danger of causing injury to self or
others if not immediately detained; and
    (3) an order of the court cannot be obtained in time to prevent the anticipated injury.
   (b) If the proposed patient has been brought to the treatment facility by another person, the
examiner shall make a good faith effort to obtain a statement of information that is available from

The examiner shall also inquire into the existence of health care directives under chapter 145, and
advance psychiatric directives under section 253B.03, subdivision 6d.
    (c) The examiner's statement shall be: (1) sufficient authority for a peace or health officer to
transport a patient to a treatment facility, (2) stated in behavioral terms and not in conclusory
language, and (3) of sufficient specificity to provide an adequate record for review. If danger to
specific individuals is a basis for the emergency hold, the statement must identify those individuals,

person immediately upon admission and a copy shall be maintained by the treatment facility.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 253B.07, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Apprehend and hold orders. The court may order the treatment facility to hold
the person in a treatment facility or direct a health officer, peace officer, or other person to take
the proposed patient into custody and transport the proposed patient to a treatment facility for
observation, evaluation, diagnosis, care, treatment, and, if necessary, confinement, when:
   (1) there has been a particularized showing by the petitioner that serious physical harm to the
proposed patient or others is likely unless the proposed patient is immediately apprehended;
   (2) the proposed patient has not voluntarily appeared for the examination or the commitment
hearing pursuant to the summons; or
   (3) a person is held pursuant to section 253B.05 and a request for a petition for commitment has

including the imposition of necessary restraint upon the proposed patient. Where possible, a peace
officer taking the proposed patient into custody pursuant to this subdivision shall not be in uniform
and shall not use a motor vehicle visibly marked as a police vehicle. Except as provided in section
253B.045, subdivision 1a, in the case of an individual on a judicial hold due to a petition for civil
commitment under section 253B.185, assignment of custody during the hold is to the commissioner

facility. Upon transfer, the head of the treatment facility shall immediately notify the court in

    The commissioner may transfer any committed person, other than a person committed as
mentally ill and dangerous to the public, or as a sexually dangerous person or as a sexual
psychopathic personality, from one regional treatment center to any other treatment facility under
the commissioner's jurisdiction which is capable of providing proper care and treatment. When a
committed person is transferred from one treatment facility to another, written notice shall be given

care agent, or spouse or, if none is known, to an interested person, and the designated agency.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 253B.15, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Provisional discharge. The head of the treatment facility may provisionally
discharge any patient without discharging the commitment, unless the patient was found by the
committing court to be a person who is mentally ill and dangerous to the public, or a sexually
dangerous person or a sexual psychopathic personality.
    Each patient released on provisional discharge shall have a written aftercare plan developed
which specifies the services and treatment to be provided as part of the aftercare plan, the financial
resources available to pay for the services specified, the expected period of provisional discharge,
the precise goals for the granting of a final discharge, and conditions or restrictions on the patient
during the period of the provisional discharge. The aftercare plan shall be provided to the patient,
the patient's attorney, and the designated agency.
    The aftercare plan shall be reviewed on a quarterly basis by the patient, designated agency and
other appropriate persons. The aftercare plan shall contain the grounds upon which a provisional
discharge may be revoked. The provisional discharge shall terminate on the date specified in the
plan unless specific action is taken to revoke or extend it.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 253B.18, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Release on pass; notification. A patient who has been committed as a person who is
mentally ill and dangerous and who is confined at a secure treatment facility or has been transferred
out of a state-operated services facility according to section 253B.18, subdivision 6, shall not be
released on a pass unless the pass is part of a pass plan that has been approved by the medical
director of the secure treatment facility. The pass plan must have a specific therapeutic purpose
consistent with the treatment plan, must be established for a specific period of time, and must have
specific levels of liberty delineated. The county case manager must be invited to participate in the
development of the pass plan. At least ten days prior to a determination on the plan, the medical
director shall notify the designated agency, the committing court, the county attorney of the county
of commitment, an interested person, the local law enforcement agency where the facility is located,
the county attorney and the local law enforcement agency in the location where the pass is to occur,
the petitioner, and the petitioner's counsel of the plan, the nature of the passes proposed, and their
right to object to the plan. If any notified person objects prior to the proposed date of implementation,
the person shall have an opportunity to appear, personally or in writing, before the medical director,
within ten days of the objection, to present grounds for opposing the plan. The pass plan shall
not be implemented until the objecting person has been furnished that opportunity. Nothing in this
subdivision shall be construed to give a patient an affirmative right to a pass plan.

    (b) A county attorney who files a petition to commit a person under this section or section
253B.185 shall make a reasonable effort to provide prompt notice of filing the petition to any
victim of a crime for which the person was convicted. In addition, the county attorney shall make a
reasonable effort to promptly notify the victim of the resolution of the petition.

effort to notify any victim of a crime for which the person was convicted that the person may
be discharged or released and that the victim has a right to submit a written statement regarding
decisions of the medical director, special review board, or commissioner with respect to the person.
To the extent possible, the notice must be provided at least 14 days before any special review board
hearing or before a determination on a pass plan. Notwithstanding section 611A.06, subdivision 4,
the commissioner shall provide the judicial appeal panel with victim information in order to comply
with the provisions of this section. The judicial appeal panel shall ensure that the data on victims
remains private as provided for in section 611A.06, subdivision 4.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to victims who have requested notification by contacting, in
writing, the county attorney in the county where the conviction for the crime occurred. A county
attorney who receives a request for notification under this paragraph shall promptly forward the
request to the commissioner of human services.
    (e) The rights under this subdivision are in addition to rights available to a victim under chapter
611A. This provision does not give a victim all the rights of a "notified person" or a person "entitled
to statutory notice" under subdivision 4a, 4b, or 5 or section 253B.185, subdivision 10.
    Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 253B.185, is amended to read:
    253B.185 SEXUAL PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY; SEXUALLY DANGEROUS.
    Subdivision 1. Commitment generally. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the
provisions of this chapter pertaining to persons who are mentally ill and dangerous to the public
apply with like force and effect to persons who are alleged or found to be sexually dangerous persons
or persons with a sexual psychopathic personality. For purposes of this section, "sexual psychopathic
personality" includes any individual committed as a "psychopathic personality" under Minnesota
Statutes 1992, section 526.10.

    (b) Before commitment proceedings are instituted, the facts shall first be submitted to the county
attorney, who, if satisfied that good cause exists, will prepare the petition. The county attorney may
request a prepetition screening report. The petition is to be executed by a person having knowledge
of the facts and filed with the committing court of the county in which the patient has a settlement
or is present. If the patient is in the custody of the commissioner of corrections, the petition may be
filed in the county where the conviction for which the person is incarcerated was entered.
    (c) Upon the filing of a petition alleging that a proposed patient is a sexually dangerous person
or is a person with a sexual psychopathic personality, the court shall hear the petition as provided
in section 253B.18.
    (d) In commitments under this section, the court shall commit the patient to a secure treatment
facility unless the patient establishes by clear and convincing evidence that a less restrictive
treatment program is available that is consistent with the patient's treatment needs and the
requirements of public safety.
   (e) After a determination that a patient is a sexually dangerous person or sexual psychopathic
personality, the court shall order commitment for an indeterminate period of time and the patient
shall be transferred, provisionally discharged, or discharged, only as provided in this section.
   Subd. 1a. Temporary confinement. During any hearing held under this section, or pending
emergency revocation of a provisional discharge, the court may order the patient or proposed patient
temporarily confined in a jail or lockup but only if:
   (1) there is no other feasible place of confinement for the patient within a reasonable distance;
   (2) the confinement is for less than 24 hours or, if during a hearing, less than 24 hours prior to
commencement and after conclusion of the hearing; and
    (3) there are protections in place, including segregation of the patient, to ensure the safety of the
patient.
    Subd. 1b. County attorney access to data. Notwithstanding sections 144.291 to 144.298;
245.467, subdivision 6; 245.4876, subdivision 7; 260B.171; 260B.235, subdivision 8; 260C.171;
and 609.749, subdivision 6, or any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, prior to filing a
petition for commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person,
and upon notice to the proposed patient, the county attorney or the county attorney's designee may
move the court for an order granting access to any records or data, to the extent it relates to the
proposed patient, for the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if
a petition is filed, to support the allegations set forth in the petition.
    The court may grant the motion if: (1) the Department of Corrections refers the case for
commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or a sexually dangerous person; or (2) upon a
showing that the requested category of data or records may be relevant to the determination by the
county attorney or designee. The court shall decide a motion under this subdivision within 48 hours
after a hearing on the motion. Notice to the proposed patient need not be given upon a showing
that such notice may result in harm or harassment of interested persons or potential witnesses.
    Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, a county attorney considering the
civil commitment of a person under this section may obtain records and data from the Department
of Corrections or any probation or parole agency in this state upon request, without a court order, for
10138                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [95TH DAY

the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if a petition is filed, to
support the allegations set forth in the petition. At the time of the request for the records, the county
attorney shall provide notice of the request to the person who is the subject of the records.
   Data collected pursuant to this subdivision shall retain their original status and, if not public, are
inadmissible in any court proceeding unrelated to civil commitment, unless otherwise permitted.
    Subd. 2. Transfer to correctional facility. (a) If a person has been committed under this section
and later is committed to the custody of the commissioner of corrections for any reason, including
but not limited to, being sentenced for a crime or revocation of the person's supervised release or
conditional release under section 244.05; 609.3455, subdivision 6, 7, or 8; Minnesota Statutes 2004,
section 609.108, subdivision 6; or Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 609.109, subdivision 7, the
person shall be transferred to a facility designated by the commissioner of corrections without regard
to the procedures provided in ­  s­

    (b) If a person is committed under this section after a commitment to the commissioner of
corrections, the person shall first serve the sentence in a facility designated by the commissioner of
corrections. After the person has served the sentence, the person shall be transferred to a treatment
program designated by the commissioner of human services.
    Subd. 3. Not to constitute defense. The existence in any person of a condition of a sexual
psychopathic personality or the fact that a person is a sexually dangerous person shall not in any
case constitute a defense to a charge of crime, nor relieve such person from liability to be tried upon
a criminal charge.
    Subd. 4. Statewide judicial panel; commitment proceedings. (a) The Supreme Court may
establish a panel of district judges with statewide authority to preside over commitment proceedings
of sexual psychopathic personalities and sexually dangerous persons. Only one judge of the panel
is required to preside over a particular commitment proceeding. Panel members shall serve for
one-year terms. One of the judges shall be designated as the chief judge of the panel, and is vested
with the power to designate the presiding judge in a particular case, to set the proper venue for the
proceedings, and to otherwise supervise and direct the operation of the panel. The chief judge shall
designate one of the other judges to act as chief judge whenever the chief judge is unable to act.
    (b) If the Supreme Court creates the judicial panel authorized by this section, all petitions for
civil commitment brought under subdivision 1 shall be filed with the supreme court instead of with
the district court in the county where the proposed patient is present, notwithstanding any provision
of subdivision 1 to the contrary. Otherwise, all of the other applicable procedures contained in this
chapter apply to commitment proceedings conducted by a judge on the panel.
   Subd. 5. Financial responsibility. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state facility" has the
meaning given in section 246.50 and also includes a Department of Corrections facility when the
proposed patient is confined in such a facility pursuant to section 253B.045, subdivision 1a.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 246.54, 253B.045, and any other law to the contrary, when a
petition is filed for commitment under this section pursuant to the notice required in section 244.05,
subdivision 7, the state and county are each responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the person's
confinement at a state facility or county jail, prior to commitment.
   (c) The county shall submit an invoice to the state court administrator for reimbursement of the

state's share of the cost of confinement.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the state's responsibility for reimbursement is limited to the
amount appropriated for this purpose.

    (c) A petition for a reduction in custody or an appeal of a revocation of provisional discharge
may be filed by either the committed person or by the head of the treatment facility and must be
filed with and considered by a panel of the special review board authorized under section 253B.18,
subdivision 4c. A committed person may not petition the special review board any sooner than six
months following either:
    (1) the entry of judgment in the district court of the order for commitment issued under section
253B.18, subdivision 3, or upon the exhaustion of all related appeal rights in state court relating to
that order, whichever is later; or
    (2) any recommendation of the special review board or order of the judicial appeal panel, or upon

treatment facility may petition at any time. The special review board proceedings are not contested
cases as defined in chapter 14.
    (d) The special review board shall hold a hearing on each petition before issuing a
recommendation under paragraph (f). Fourteen days before the hearing, the committing court,
the county attorney of the county of commitment, the designated agency, an interested person,
the petitioner and the petitioner's counsel, and the committed person and the committed person's
counsel must be given written notice by the commissioner of the time and place of the hearing

    (e) A person or agency receiving notice that submits documentary evidence to the special
review board before the hearing must also provide copies to the committed person, the committed
person's counsel, the county attorney of the county of commitment, the case manager, and the

    (2) "victim" means a person who has incurred loss or harm as a result of a crime, the behavior
for which forms the basis for a commitment under this section or section 253B.18; and
    (3) "convicted" and "conviction" have the meanings given in section 609.02, subdivision 5, and
also include juvenile court adjudications, findings under Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure,
rule 20.02, that the elements of a crime have been proved, and findings in commitment cases under
this section or section 253B.18, that an act or acts constituting a crime occurred.
    (b) A county attorney who files a petition to commit a person under this section shall make a
reasonable effort to provide prompt notice of filing the petition to any victim of a crime for which
the person was convicted. In addition, the county attorney shall make a reasonable effort to promptly
notify the victim of the resolution of the petition.
    (c) Before provisionally discharging, discharging, granting pass-eligible status, approving a pass
plan, or otherwise permanently or temporarily releasing a person committed under this section
from a treatment facility, the head of the treatment facility shall make a reasonable effort to notify
any victim of a crime for which the person was convicted that the person may be discharged or
released and that the victim has a right to submit a written statement regarding decisions of the
head of the treatment facility or designee, or special review board, with respect to the person. To
the extent possible, the notice must be provided at least 14 days before any special review board
hearing or before a determination on a pass plan. Notwithstanding section 611A.06, subdivision 4,
the commissioner shall provide the judicial appeal panel with victim information in order to comply
with the provisions of this section. The judicial appeal panel shall ensure that the data on victims
remains private as provided for in section 611A.06, subdivision 4.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to victims who have requested notification by contacting, in
writing, the county attorney in the county where the conviction for the crime occurred or where the

attorney who receives a request for notification under this paragraph shall promptly forward the
request to the commissioner of human services.
    (e) Rights under this subdivision are in addition to rights available to a victim under chapter
611A. This provision does not give a victim all the rights of a "notified person" or a person "entitled

psychopathic personality shall not be transferred out of a secure treatment facility unless it appears to
the satisfaction of the judicial appeal panel, after a hearing and recommendation by a majority of the
special review board, that the transfer is appropriate. Transfer may be to other treatment programs
under the commissioner's control.
   (b) The following factors must be considered in determining whether a transfer is appropriate:
   (1) the person's clinical progress and present treatment needs;
   (2) the need for security to accomplish continuing treatment;
   (3) the need for continued institutionalization;
   (4) which facility can best meet the person's needs; and
10142                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [95TH DAY

   (5) whether transfer can be accomplished with a reasonable degree of safety for the public.
    Subd. 12. Provisional discharge. A patient who is committed as a sexual psychopathic
personality or sexually dangerous person shall not be provisionally discharged unless it appears to
the satisfaction of the judicial appeal panel, after a hearing and a recommendation by a majority of
the special review board, that the patient is capable of making an acceptable adjustment to open
society.
    The following factors are to be considered in determining whether a provisional discharge shall
be recommended:
    (1) whether the patient's course of treatment and present mental status indicate there is no longer
a need for treatment and supervision in the patient's current treatment setting; and
   (2) whether the conditions of the provisional discharge plan will provide a reasonable degree of
protection to the public and will enable the patient to adjust successfully to the community.
    Subd. 13. Provisional discharge plan. A provisional discharge plan shall be developed,
implemented, and monitored by the head of the treatment facility or designee in conjunction with
the patient and other appropriate persons. The head of the treatment facility or designee shall,
at least quarterly, review the plan with the patient and submit a written report to the designated
agency concerning the patient's status and compliance with each term of the plan.
    Subd. 14. Provisional discharge; review. A provisional discharge pursuant to this section shall
not automatically terminate. A full discharge shall occur only as provided in subdivision 18. The
commissioner shall notify the patient that the terms of a provisional discharge continue unless the
patient requests and is granted a change in the conditions of provisional discharge or unless the
patient petitions the special review board for a full discharge and the discharge is granted by the
judicial appeal panel.
    Subd. 15. Provisional discharge; revocation. (a) The head of the treatment facility may revoke
a provisional discharge if either of the following grounds exist:
   (1) the patient has departed from the conditions of the provisional discharge plan; or
   (2) the patient is exhibiting behavior which may be dangerous to self or others.
    (b) The head of the treatment facility may revoke the provisional discharge and, either orally
or in writing, order that the patient be immediately returned to the treatment facility. A report
documenting reasons for revocation shall be issued by the head of the treatment facility within
seven days after the patient is returned to the treatment facility. Advance notice to the patient of
the revocation is not required.
    (c) The patient must be provided a copy of the revocation report and informed, orally and in
writing, of the rights of a patient under this section. The revocation report shall be served upon
the patient, the patient's counsel, and the designated agency. The report shall outline the specific
reasons for the revocation, including but not limited to the specific facts upon which the revocation
recommendation is based.
   (d) An individual who is revoked from provisional discharge must successfully re-petition the
special review board and judicial appeal panel prior to being placed back on provisional discharge.
95TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 3, 2010                                        10143

    Subd. 16. Return of absent patient. If the patient is absent without authorization, the head of
the treatment facility or designee may request a peace officer to return the patient to the treatment
facility. The head of the treatment facility shall inform the committing court of the revocation or
absence, and the court shall direct a peace officer in the county where the patient is located to return
the patient to the treatment facility or to another treatment facility. The expense of returning the
patient to a treatment facility shall be paid by the commissioner unless paid by the patient or other
persons on the patient's behalf.
    Subd. 17. Appeal. Any patient aggrieved by a revocation decision or any interested person may
petition the special review board within seven days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays, after receipt of the revocation report for a review of the revocation. The matter shall be
scheduled within 30 days. The special review board shall review the circumstances leading to the
revocation and shall recommend to the judicial appeal panel whether or not the revocation shall be
upheld. The special review board may also recommend a new provisional discharge at the time of
the revocation hearing.
    Subd. 18. Discharge. A patient who is committed as a sexual psychopathic personality or
sexually dangerous person shall not be discharged unless it appears to the satisfaction of the judicial
appeal panel, after a hearing and recommendation by a majority of the special review board, that
the patient is capable of making an acceptable adjustment to open society, is no longer dangerous
to the public, and is no longer in need of inpatient treatment and supervision.
    In determining whether a discharge shall be recommended, the special review board and
judicial appeal panel shall consider whether specific conditions exist to provide a reasonable degree
of protection to the public and to assist the patient in adjusting to the community. If the desired
conditions do not exist, the discharge shall not be granted.
   Subd. 19. Aftercare services. The Minnesota sex offender program shall provide the
supervision, aftercare, and case management services for a person under commitment as sexual
psychopathic personalities and sexually dangerous persons discharged after July 1, 1999. The
designated agency shall assist with client eligibility for public welfare benefits and will provide
those services that are currently available exclusively through county government.
    Prior to the date of discharge or provisional discharge of any patient committed as a sexual
psychopathic personality or sexually dangerous person, the head of the treatment facility or designee
shall establish a continuing plan of aftercare services for the patient, including a plan for medical
and behavioral health services, financial sustainability, housing, social supports, or other assistance
the patient needs. The Minnesota sex offender program shall provide case management services and
shall assist the patient in finding employment, suitable shelter, and adequate medical and behavioral
health services and otherwise assist in the patient's readjustment to the community.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 253B.19, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Petition; hearing. (a) A person committed as mentally ill and dangerous to the public
under section 253B.18, or the county attorney of the county from which the person was committed
or the county of financial responsibility, may petition the judicial appeal panel for a rehearing
and reconsideration of a decision by the commissioner under section 253B.18, subdivision 5. The
judicial appeal panel must not consider petitions for relief other than those considered by the
commissioner from which the appeal is taken. The petition must be filed with the Supreme Court
within 30 days after the decision of the commissioner is signed. The hearing must be held within
10144                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [95TH DAY

45 days of the filing of the petition unless an extension is granted for good cause.
    (b) A person committed as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person
under section 253B.185, or committed as both mentally ill and dangerous to the public under section
253B.18 and as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person under section
253B.185; the county attorney of the county from which the person was committed or the county of
financial responsibility; or the commissioner may petition the judicial appeal panel for a rehearing
and reconsideration of a decision of the special review board under section 253B.185, subdivision
9. The petition must be filed with the Supreme Court within 30 days after the decision is mailed by
the commissioner as required in section 253B.185, subdivision 9, paragraph (f). The hearing must
be held within 180 days of the filing of the petition unless an extension is granted for good cause.
If no party petitions the judicial appeal panel for a rehearing or reconsideration within 30 days, the
judicial appeal panel shall either issue an order adopting the recommendations of the special review
board or set the matter on for a hearing pursuant to this paragraph.
    (c) For an appeal under paragraph (a) or (b), the Supreme Court shall refer the petition to the
chief judge of the judicial appeal panel. The chief judge shall notify the patient, the county attorney
of the county of commitment, the designated agency, the commissioner, the head of the treatment
facility, any interested person, and other persons the chief judge designates, of the time and place of
the hearing on the petition. The notice shall be given at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing.
    (d) Any person may oppose the petition. The patient, the patient's counsel, the county attorney
of the committing county or the county of financial responsibility, and the commissioner shall
participate as parties to the proceeding pending before the judicial appeal panel, except when the
patient is committed solely as mentally ill and dangerous, and shall, no later than 20 days before the
hearing on the petition, inform the judicial appeal panel and the opposing party in writing whether
they support or oppose the petition and provide a summary of facts in support of their position.
The judicial appeal panel may appoint examiners and may adjourn the hearing from time to time.
It shall hear and receive all relevant testimony and evidence and make a record of all proceedings.
The patient, the patient's counsel, and the county attorney of the committing county or the county
of financial responsibility have the right to be present and may present and cross-examine all
witnesses and offer a factual and legal basis in support of their positions. The petitioning party
seeking discharge or provisional discharge bears the burden of going forward with the evidence,
which means presenting a prima facie case with competent evidence to show that the person is
entitled to the requested relief. If the petitioning party has met this burden, the party opposing
discharge or provisional discharge bears the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence that

employers at the same rate as premiums paid to other members of the association. For purposes
