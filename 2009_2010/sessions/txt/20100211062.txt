under section 429.091 shall not exceed the amount of the cost estimate contained in the petition.
In the case of a petition for the installation of a fire protection system, a pedestrian skyway
system, on-site energy conservation improvements, or on-site water contaminant improvements,
the petitioner may request abandonment of the improvement at any time after it has been ordered
pursuant to subdivision 1 and before contracts have been awarded for the construction of the
improvement under section 429.041, subdivision 2. If such a request is received, the city council
shall abandon the proceedings but in such case the petitioner shall reimburse the city for any and
all expenses incurred by the city in connection with the improvement.

    Subd. 2. Certification of small businesses. (a) Businesses may apply to the commissioner for

commissioner to be used for personnel and administrative expenses related to administering the
program.
    (b) A business seeking certification must submit an application for each taxable year for which
the business desires certification. If a qualified small business receives a qualified investment for
which tax credits are allocated, the business must annually submit a certified small business report

all other requirements for that allocation, the tax credits are no longer subject to revocation.
    Subd. 5. Credit allowed. (a) A qualified taxpayer or angel investor network fund is allowed
a credit for investment in a qualified small business in the amount determined by the certification
allocated by the commissioner against the tax imposed by chapter 290. The commissioner must not
allocate more than $10,000,000 in credits to qualified taxpayers or angel investment network funds
per taxable year for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2012,
and must not allocate more than $12,000,000 in credits per year for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2011. Any portion of a taxable year's credits that is not allocated by the commissioner
does not cancel and may be carried forward to the subsequent taxable year until all credits have been
allocated. Applications for tax investment credits must be made available on the department's Web
site by September 1, 2010, and the department must begin accepting applications by September 1,
2010. Applications for subsequent years must be made available by November 1 of the preceding

    (b) Tax investment credits must be allocated to qualified taxpayers or angel investor network
funds in the order that the tax credit request applications are filed with the department. The
investment specified in the application must be made within 60 days of the allocation of the
credits. If the investment is not made within 60 days, the credits are deemed revoked. A qualified
taxpayer or angel investor network fund that fails to invest as specified in the application, within
60 days from allocation of the credits, must notify the department of the failure to invest within
five business days of the expiration of the 60-day investment period.
    (c) All tax credit request applications filed with the department on the same day must be treated
as having been filed contemporaneously. In the event that two or more qualified taxpayers or angel
investment network funds file tax credit request applications on the same day, and the aggregate
amount of credit allocation claims exceeds the aggregate limit of credit under this section or the
lesser amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day, then the credits must be allocated
among the qualified taxpayers or angel investment network funds who filed on that day on a pro rata
basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata allocation for any one qualified taxpayer
or angel investment network fund is the product obtained by multiplying a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a qualified taxpayer and the
denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on behalf of all applicants on
that day, by the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day for the fiscal year.
   (d) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of every credit allocated and
every credit revoked under this section.

  Sec. 2. [290.0692] SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT CREDIT; CREDIT ALLOWED;

    Subdivision 1. Credit allowed. A qualified taxpayer is allowed a credit against the tax imposed
under this chapter for investments made in the year in a qualified small business as defined under
section 116J.8737. The credit equals 25 percent of the qualified taxpayer's investment in the
business, but not to exceed the lesser of:
   (1) the liability for tax under this chapter, including the applicable alternative minimum tax, but
excluding the minimum fee under section 290.0922; and
   (2) the amount of the certificate provided to the qualified taxpayer under section 116J.8737.
    Subd. 2. Limitations. No taxpayer may receive more than $125,000 in credits under this section
in any one year.
    Subd. 3. Holding periods. The credit is allowed only for investments for which a credit has been
allocated by the commissioner of employment and economic development under section 116J.8737.
Any credit taken by a taxpayer must be repaid, and any unused credits must be canceled, if the
investment in the qualified small business is not held for at least three years. The three-year holding
period does not apply if:
    (1) the investment by the qualified taxpayer becomes worthless before the end of the three-year
period;
    (2) 80 percent or more of the assets of the qualified small business is sold before the end of the
three-year period;
   (3) the qualified small business is sold before the end of the three-year period; or

end of the three-year period.
    Subd. 4. Proportional credits. Each pass-through entity must provide each investor a statement
indicating the investor's share of the credit amount certified to the pass-through entity based on its
share of the pass-through entity's assets at the time of the qualified investment.
    Subd. 5. Carryover. If the amount of the credit under this subdivision for any taxable year
exceeds the liability for tax, the excess is a credit carryover to each of the ten succeeding taxable
years. The entire amount of the excess unused credit for the taxable year must be carried first to the
earliest of the taxable years to which the credit may be carried. The amount of the unused credit that
may be added under this subdivision may not exceed the taxpayer's liability for tax less the credit
for the taxable year.
    Subd. 6. Transfer of credits. Any taxpayer who has not had liability under this chapter for the
immediate past three taxable years and does not have anticipated liability for the current taxable
year may transfer the entirety of the credit to any natural person of net worth, as defined in the Code
of Federal Regulations, title 17, section 230.501(a). No person is entitled to a refund for the interest
created under this subdivision. Only the full credit for any one taxpayer may be transferred and the
interest may be transferred only one time. A credit acquired by transfer is subject to the limitations

prescribed in this section. Documentation of any credit acquired by transfer must be provided by
the taxpayer in the form required by the commissioner.
    Subd. 7. Audit powers. Notwithstanding the certification eligibility issued by the commissioner
of employment and economic development under section 116J.8737, the commissioner may utilize
any audit and examination powers under chapter 270C or 289A to the extent necessary to verify that
the taxpayer is eligible for the credit and to assess for the amount of any improperly claimed credit.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for investments made after July 1, 2010, for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, and only applies to investments for which a credit
has been allocated.

    Subd. 5. Process. To claim the credit, the taxpayer must apply to the State Historic Preservation
Office of the Minnesota Historical Society before a historic rehabilitation project begins. The State
Historic Preservation Office shall determine the amount of eligible rehabilitation costs and whether
the rehabilitation meets the standards of the United States Department of the Interior. The State
Historic Preservation Office shall issue certificates verifying eligibility for and the amount of credit.
The taxpayer shall attach the certificate to any income tax return on which the credit is claimed.

rehabilitation of the building.
    (c) In exchange for the certificate, the lending institution must provide to the taxpayer an amount
equal to the face amount of the certificate discounted by the amount by which the federal income tax
liability of the lending institution is increased due to its use of the certificate in the manner provided
in this section. That amount must be applied, as directed by the taxpayer, in whole or in part, to
reduce:
   (1) the principal amount of the loan;

    (d) The lending institution may take as a credit against the tax due under this chapter an amount

exceeds the amount by which the lending institution's federal income tax liability is increased

    (c) The department may certify partnerships, corporations, trusts, or limited liability companies,
organized on a for-profit basis, which submit an application to be designated as a Minnesota
business investment company if the applicant is located, headquartered, and licensed or registered
to conduct business in Minnesota, has as its primary business activity the investment of cash in
qualified businesses, and meets the other criteria in this section.
   (d) The department must review the organizational documents of each applicant for certification
and the business history of each applicant and determine whether the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of this section.
    (e) Within 45 days after the receipt of an application, the department must issue the certification
or refuse the certification and communicate in detail to the applicant the grounds for refusal,
including suggestions for the removal of such grounds.
   (f) The department must begin accepting applications to become a Minnesota business
investment company as defined under section 297I.23 by August 1, 2010.
   (g) All certification fees collected by the department under this section are appropriated to the
commissioner to be used for personnel and administrative expenses related to administering the
program.
    Subd. 3. Requirements. (a) A participating investor or affiliate of a participating investor must
not, directly or indirectly:
   (1) beneficially own, whether through rights, options, convertible interest, or otherwise, 15
percent or more of the voting securities or other voting ownership interest of a Minnesota business
investment company;
   (2) manage a Minnesota business investment company; or
   (3) control the direction of investments for a Minnesota business investment company.
   (b) A Minnesota business investment company may obtain one or more guaranties, indemnities,
bonds, insurance policies, or other payment undertakings for the benefit of its participating investors

be entitled to provide the guaranties, indemnities, bonds, insurance policies, or other payment
undertakings in favor of the participating investors of a Minnesota business investment company
and its affiliates in this state.
    (c) This subdivision does not preclude a participating investor, insurance company, or other party
from exercising its legal rights and remedies, including, without limitation, interim management
of a Minnesota business investment company, in the event that a Minnesota business investment
company is in default of its statutory obligations or its contractual obligations to the participating

investor, insurance company, or other party, or from monitoring a Minnesota business investment
company to ensure its compliance with this section or disallowing any investments that have not
been approved by the department.
    (d) The department may contract with an independent third party to review, investigate, and
certify that the applications comply with this section.
   Subd. 4. Aggregate limitations on investment tax credits; allocation. (a) The aggregate
amount of investment tax credits to be allocated to all participating investors of Minnesota business
investment companies under this section shall not exceed $100,000,000. No Minnesota business
investment company, on an aggregate basis with its affiliates, may file credit allocation claims that
exceed $100,000,000.
    (b) Credits must be allocated to participating investors in the order that the credit allocation
claims are filed with the department, provided that all credit allocation claims filed with the
department on the same day must be treated as having been filed contemporaneously. Any credit
allocation claims filed with the department prior to the initial credit allocation claim filing date are
deemed to have been filed on the initial credit allocation claim filing date. The department must set
the initial credit allocation claim filing date not less than 120 days and not greater than 150 days
after the department begins accepting applications for certification.
    (c) In the event that two or more Minnesota business investment companies file credit allocation
claims with the department on behalf of their respective participating investors on the same day,
and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims exceeds the aggregate limit of investment tax
credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day, then
the department must allocate the credits among the participating investors who filed on that day on a
pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata allocation for any one participating
investor is the product obtained by multiplying a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a participating investor and the denominator of which is
the total of all credit allocation claims filed on behalf of all participating investors on that day, by the
aggregate limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain unallocated
on that day.
    (d) Within ten business days after the department receives a credit allocation claim filed by a
Minnesota business investment company on behalf of one or more of its participating investors,
the department must notify the Minnesota business investment company of the amount of credits
allocated to each of the participating investors of that Minnesota business investment company. In
the event a Minnesota business investment company does not receive an investment of designated
capital from each participating investor required to earn the amount of credits allocated to the
participating investor within ten business days of the Minnesota business investment company's
receipt of notice of allocation, then it shall notify the department on or before the next business
day, and the credits allocated to the participating investor of the Minnesota business investment
company are forfeited. The department must then reallocate those forfeited credits among the
participating investors of the other Minnesota business investment companies on a pro rata basis
with respect to the credit allocation claims filed on behalf of the participating investors. The
commissioner is authorized, but not required, to levy a fine of not more than $50,000 on any
participating investor that does not invest the full amount of designated capital required to fund
the credits allocated to it by the department in accordance with the credit allocation claim filed on
its behalf.
6924                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

    (e) No participating investor, on an aggregate basis with its affiliates, may file an allocation claim
for more than 25 percent of the maximum amount of investment tax credits authorized under this
subdivision, regardless of whether the claim is made in connection with one or more Minnesota
business investment companies.
   Subd. 5. Requirements for continuance of certification. (a) To maintain its certification, a
Minnesota business investment company must make qualified investments as follows:
   (1) within two years after the allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company must
invest an amount equal to at least 35 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments; and
   (2) within three years after the allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company must
invest an amount equal to at least 50 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments.
    (b) Prior to making a proposed qualified investment in a specific business, a Minnesota business
investment company must request from the department a written determination that the proposed
investment qualifies as a qualified investment in a qualified business. The department must notify
a Minnesota business investment company within ten business days from the receipt of a request
of its determination and an explanation thereof. If the department fails to notify the Minnesota
business investment company of its determination within the ten-business-day period, the proposed
investment is deemed a qualified investment in a qualified business. If the department determines
that the proposed investment does not meet the definition of a qualified investment or qualified
business, or both, the department may nevertheless consider the proposed investment a qualified
investment and, if necessary, the business a qualified business, if the department determines that the
proposed investment furthers state economic development.
   (c) All designated capital not invested in qualified investments by a Minnesota business
investment company shall be held or invested in such manner as the Minnesota business investment
company, in its discretion, deems appropriate. Designated capital and proceeds of designated
capital returned to a Minnesota business investment company after being originally invested in
qualified investments may be invested again in qualified investments and the investment shall
count toward the requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to making investments of designated
capital in qualified investments.
    (d) If, within four years after its allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company has
not invested at least 60 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments, the Minnesota
business investment company must not be permitted to pay management fees.
    (e) If, within six years after its allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company has
not invested at least 100 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments, the Minnesota
business investment company must not be permitted to pay management fees.
   (f) A Minnesota business investment company may not invest more than 15 percent of its
designated capital in any one qualified business without the specific approval of the department.
   (g) For purposes of calculating the investment percentage thresholds of paragraph (a), the
cumulative amount of all qualified investments made by a Minnesota business investment company
from the allocation date must be considered.
   Subd. 6. Minnesota business investment company reporting requirements. (a) Each
Minnesota business investment company must report the following to the department in the form
62ND DAY]                      THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2010                                    6925

designated by the commissioner:

   (iii) the date on which the designated capital was received;
   (2) on an annual basis, on or before January 31 of each year:
    (i) the amount of the Minnesota business investment company's designated capital that remains
to be invested in qualified investments at the end of the immediately preceding taxable year;
   (ii) whether or not the Minnesota business investment company has invested more than 15
percent of its total designated capital in any one business;
   (iii) all qualified investments that the Minnesota business investment company has made in the
previous taxable year, including the number of employees of each qualified business in which it has
made investments at the time of such investment, and as of December 1 of the preceding taxable
year; and
    (iv) for any qualified business where the Minnesota business investment company no longer has
an investment, the Minnesota business investment company must provide employment figures for
that company as of the last day before the investment was terminated;
    (3) other information that the department may reasonably request that helps the department
ascertain the impact of the Minnesota business investment company program both directly and
indirectly on the economy of the state including, but not limited to, the number of jobs created
by qualified businesses that have received qualified investments;
   (4) within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year, annual audited financial statements of the
Minnesota business investment company, which must include the opinion of an independent certified
public accountant; and
   (5) an agreed upon procedures report or equivalent regarding the operations of the Minnesota
business investment company.
    (b) A Minnesota business investment company must pay to the department an annual,
nonrefundable certification fee of $5,000 on or before April 1, or $10,000 if later. No annual
certification fee is required if the payment date for the fee is within six months of the date a
Minnesota business investment company is first certified by the department.
    (c) Upon satisfying the requirements of subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (2), a Minnesota
business investment company must provide the notice to the department and the department shall,
within 60 days of receipt of the notice, either confirm that the Minnesota business investment
company has satisfied the requirements of subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (2), as of such
date or provide notice of noncompliance and an explanation of any existing deficiencies. If the
department does not provide notification within 60 days, the Minnesota business investment
company is deemed to have met the requirements of subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (2).

    Subd. 7. Distributions. (a) A Minnesota business investment company may make qualified
distributions at any time. In order for a Minnesota business investment company to make a
distribution other than a qualified distribution to its equity holders, the cumulative amount of all
qualified investments of the Minnesota business investment company must equal or exceed 100
percent of its designated capital.
    (b) The state shall receive ten percent of the net profits on qualified investments. For purposes
of this paragraph, "net profits on qualified investments" means the amount of money returned to the
Minnesota business investment company in exchange for or repayment of its qualified investments
in qualified businesses in excess of the amount invested by the Minnesota business investment
company in qualified investments. The net profits on qualified investments are the aggregate of
all of the Minnesota business investment company's qualified investments where gains on qualified
investments are netted against losses on qualified investments.
    Subd. 8. Decertification. (a) The department shall conduct an annual review of each Minnesota
business investment company to determine if a Minnesota business investment company is abiding
by the requirements of certification and to ensure that no investment has been made in violation of
this section. The cost of the annual review must be paid by each Minnesota business investment
company according to a reasonable fee schedule adopted by the department.
    (b) Any material violation of this section, including any material misrepresentation made to the
department in connection with the application process, is grounds for decertification of a Minnesota
business investment company and the disallowance of credits under section 297I.23, provided that
in all instances the department shall provide notice to the Minnesota business investment company
of the grounds of the proposed decertification and the opportunity to cure the violation before any
decertification becomes effective.
    (c) The department shall send written notice of decertification to the commissioner of revenue
and to the address of each participating investor whose tax credit may be subject to recapture or
forfeiture, using the address shown on the last filing submitted to the department.
    (d) Once a Minnesota business investment company has invested an amount cumulatively
equal to 100 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments, provided that the Minnesota
business investment company has met all other requirements under this section as of such date,
the Minnesota business investment company is no longer subject to regulation by the department
or the reporting requirements under subdivision 6. Upon receiving certification by a Minnesota
business investment company that it has invested an amount equal to 100 percent of its designated
capital, the department shall notify a Minnesota business investment company within 60 days
that it has or has not met the requirements, with a reason for the determination if it has not. If the
department does not provide notification of deregulation within 60 days, the Minnesota business
investment company is deemed to have met the requirements and is deemed to no longer be subject
to regulation by the department.
   Subd. 9. Registration requirements. All investments by participating investors for which tax
credits are awarded under this section must be registered or specifically exempt from registration.
    Subd. 10. Rulemaking exception. The commissioner's actions in establishing procedures and
requirements and in making determinations and certifications to administer this section are not a
rule for purposes of chapter 14, are not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act contained in
chapter 14, and are not subject to section 14.386.

    Subd. 11. Reports to governor and legislature. The department shall make an annual report

   (4) the cumulative amount of follow-on capital that the investments of each Minnesota business
investment company have created in terms of capital invested in qualified businesses at the same
time or subsequent to investments made by a Minnesota business investment company in such
businesses by sources other than Minnesota business investment companies;
   (5) the total amount of investment tax credits applied under this section for each year;
   (6) the performance of each Minnesota business investment company with regard to the
requirements for continued certification;
   (7) the classification of the companies in which each Minnesota business investment company
has invested according to industrial sector and size of company;
   (8) the gross number of jobs created by investments made by each Minnesota business
investment company and the number of jobs retained;
   (9) the location of the companies in which each Minnesota business investment company has
invested;

reasons for decertification; and
   (11) other related information as necessary to evaluate the effect of this section on economic
development.

   Sec. 2. [297I.23] MINNESOTA BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY CREDIT.
    Subdivision 1. Credit allowed. (a) A participating investor as defined under section 116J.665,
subdivision 1, is allowed a credit against the tax imposed in this chapter equal to 80 percent of
the participating investor's investment of designated capital in a Minnesota business investment
company. Beginning January 1, 2014, in tax years 2014 to 2017, a participating investor may claim
an amount equal to 20 percent of the participating investor's investment of designated capital.
    (b) The credit for any taxable year must not exceed the liability for tax. If the amount of the
credit determined under this section for any taxable year exceeds the liability for tax, the excess
is an investment tax credit carryover to each of the succeeding taxable years and must be carried
forward to each succeeding taxable year until the entire carryforward has been credited against the
participating investor's liability for tax under this chapter. Credits may be used in connection with
both estimated and return payments of a participating investor's state premium tax liability.
6928                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [62ND DAY

   (c) A participating investor claiming a credit under this section is not required to pay any
additional retaliatory tax levied by Minnesota as a result of claiming the credit.
    (d) A participating investor is not required to reduce the amount of tax pursuant to the state
premium tax liability included by the participating investor in connection with ratemaking for any
insurance contract written in this state because of a reduction in the participating investor's tax
liability based on the tax credit allowed under this section.
    (e) Decertification of a Minnesota business investment company under section 116J.665 may
result in the disallowance and the recapture of the credit allowed under this section. The amount
disallowed and recaptured must be assessed as follows:
    (1) decertification of a Minnesota business investment company within two years of the
allocation date of tax credits and prior to meeting the requirements of section 116J.665, subdivision
5, paragraph (a), clause (1), shall result in the disallowance of all of the credits allowed under this
section;
    (2) decertification of a Minnesota business investment company after two years of the allocation
date of tax credits, but prior to meeting the requirements of section 116J.665, subdivision 5,
paragraph (a), clause (1), results in the disallowance of one-half of all the credits allowed under
this section; and
    (3) decertification of Minnesota business investment company that has already met the
requirements of section 116J.665, subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (1), does not cause the
disallowance of any credits allowed under this section nor the recapture of any portion of the
credits that was previously taken.
    Subd. 2. Transfers. A participating investor must not transfer, agree to transfer, sell, or agree
to sell the credit under this section until 180 days from the date on which the participating investor
invested designated capital. After 180 days from the date of investment, a participating investor,
or subsequent transferee, may transfer credits to another person who is subject to tax and must
notify the department in the form prescribed by the commissioner within 30 days of the transfer.
A person must not transfer a credit more than once in a 12-month period. No person is entitled to
a refund for the interest created under this subdivision. A credit acquired by transfer is subject to
the limitations prescribed in this section. Any transfer or sale of the credits does not affect the time
schedule for claiming the credit. Any tax credits recaptured under this section remain the liability
of the participating investor that actually applied the credit towards its tax liability.
    Subd. 3. Repayment of tax benefits received. (a) Decertification of a Minnesota small business
investment company or revocation of credits under section 116J.665, results in the disallowance to
certified investors of any credits for that tax year or future tax years and the participating investor
is required to repay any credits claimed for the previous year. Repayment must be made within 60
days of the decertification or the revocation of the certification.
   (b) The provisions of chapters 270C and 297I relating to audit, assessment, refund, collection,
and appeals are applicable to the credits claimed and repayment required under this section. The
commissioner may impose civil penalties as provided in section 297I.85, and additional tax and
penalties are subject to interest at the rate provided in section 270C.40, from the date payment was
due.
