    Subd. 2. Administration; duties. (a) The commissioner of natural resources may adopt
rules under chapter 14 as are necessary for the administration of the Mississippi River corridor
critical area program. Duties of the Environmental Quality Council or the Environmental Quality
Board referenced in this chapter, related rules, and the governor's executive order number 79-19,
published in the State Register on March 12, 1979, that are related to the Mississippi River corridor
critical area shall be the duties of the commissioner. All rules adopted by the board pursuant to
these duties remain in effect and shall be enforced until amended or repealed by the commissioner
in accordance with law. The commissioner shall work in consultation with the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, the Metropolitan Council, other agencies, and local
units of government to ensure that the Mississippi River corridor critical area is managed as a
multipurpose resource in a way that:
    (1) conserves the scenic, environmental, recreational, mineral, economic, cultural, and historic
resources and functions of the river corridor;
    (2) maintains the river channel for transportation by providing and maintaining barging and
fleeting areas in appropriate locations consistent with the character of the Mississippi River and
riverfront;
   (3) provides for the continuation and development of a variety of urban uses, including industrial
and commercial uses, and residential uses, where appropriate, within the Mississippi River corridor;

   (4) utilizes certain reaches of the river as a source of water supply and as a receiving water for
properly treated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste effluents; and
   (5) protects and preserves the biological and ecological functions of the corridor.
    (b) The Metropolitan Council shall incorporate the standards developed under this section into
its planning and shall work with local units of government and the commissioner to ensure the
standards are being adopted and implemented appropriately.
    Subd. 3. Districts. The commissioner shall establish, by rule, districts within the Mississippi
River corridor critical area. The commissioner must seek to determine an appropriate number of
districts within any one municipality and take into account municipal plans and policies, and existing
ordinances and conditions. The commissioner shall consider the following when establishing the
districts:
   (1) the protection of resources that existed as of March 12, 1979;
    (2) the protection of improvements such as parks, trails, natural areas, recreational areas, and
interpretive centers;
   (3) the use of the Mississippi River as a source of drinking water;
  (4) the protection of resources identified in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area
Comprehensive Management Plan;
   (5) the protection of resources identified in comprehensive plans developed by counties, cities,
and towns within the Mississippi River corridor critical area;
   (6) the intent of the Mississippi River corridor critical area land use districts from the governor's
executive order number 79-19, published in the State Register on March 12, 1979; and
   (7) identified scenic, geologic, and ecological resources.
    Subd. 4. Standards. (a) The commissioner shall establish, by rule, minimum guidelines and
standards for the districts established in subdivision 3. The guidelines and standards for each district
shall include: the intent of each district; key resources and features to be protected or enhanced
based upon paragraph (b); permitted uses; and dimensional and performance standards for
development. The commissioner must take into account municipal plans and policies, and existing
ordinances and conditions when developing the guidelines in this section. The commissioner may
provide certain exceptions and criteria for standards, including, but not limited to, exceptions
for river access facilities, water supply facilities, stormwater facilities, and wastewater treatment
facilities, and hydropower facilities.
    (b) The guidelines and standards must protect or enhance the following key resources and
features:
   (1) floodplains;
   (2) wetlands;
   (3) gorges;
   (4) areas of confluence with key tributaries;

   (5) natural drainage routes;
   (6) shorelines and riverbanks;
   (7) bluffs;
   (8) steep slopes and very steep slopes;
   (9) unstable soils and bedrock;
   (10) significant existing vegetative stands, tree canopies, and native plant communities;
   (11) scenic views and vistas;
   (12) publicly owned parks, trails, and open spaces;
   (13) cultural and historic sites and structures; and
   (14) water quality.
    (c) The commissioner shall establish a map to define bluffs and bluff-related features within the
Mississippi River corridor critical area. At the outset of the rulemaking process, the commissioner
shall create a preliminary map of all the bluffs and bluff lines within the Mississippi River corridor
critical area, based on the guidelines in paragraph (d). The rulemaking process shall provide an
opportunity to refine the preliminary bluff map. The commissioner may add to or remove areas of
demonstrably unique or atypical conditions that warrant special protection or exemption. At the end
of the rulemaking process, the commissioner shall adopt a final bluff map that contains associated
features, including bluff lines, bases of bluffs, steep slopes, and very steep slopes.
  (d) The following guidelines shall be used by the commissioner to create a preliminary bluff
map as part of the rulemaking process:
   (1) "bluff face" or "bluff" means the area between the bluff line and the bluff base. A high, steep,
natural topographic feature such as a broad hill, cliff, or embankment with a slope of 18 percent or
greater and a vertical rise of at least ten feet between the bluff base and the bluff line;
    (2) "bluff line" means a line delineating the top of a slope connecting the points at which the slope
becomes less than 18 percent. More than one bluff line may be encountered proceeding upslope from
the river valley;
    (3) "base of the bluff" means a line delineating the bottom of a slope connecting the points
at which the slope becomes 18 percent or greater. More than one bluff base may be encountered
proceeding landward from the water;
    (4) "steep slopes" means 12 percent to 18 percent slopes. Steep slopes are natural topographic
features with an average slope of 12 to 18 percent measured over a horizontal distance of 50 feet or
more; and
    (5) "very steep slopes" means slopes 18 percent or greater. Very steep slopes are natural
topographic features with an average slope of 18 percent or greater, measured over a horizontal
distance of 50 feet or more.
   Subd. 5. Application. The standards established under this section shall be used:

   (1) by local units of government when preparing or updating plans or modifying regulations;
    (2) by state and regional agencies for permit regulation and in developing plans within their
jurisdiction;
   (3) by the Metropolitan Council for reviewing plans, regulations, and development permit
applications; and
   (4) by the commissioner when approving plans, regulations, and development permit
applications.
    Subd. 6. Notification; fees. A local unit of government or a regional or state agency shall notify
the commissioner of natural resources of all developments in the corridor that require discretionary
actions under their rules at least 10 days before taking final action on the application. A local unit of
government or agency failing to notify the commissioner at least ten days before taking final action
shall submit a late fee of $50 to the commissioner. For purposes of this section, a discretionary action
includes all actions that require a public hearing, including variances, conditional use permits, and
zoning amendments.
    Subd. 7. Rules. The commissioner shall adopt rules to ensure compliance with this section. By
January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall begin the rulemaking required by this section. Until the
rules required under this section take effect, the commissioner shall administer the Mississippi River
corridor critical area program in accordance with the governor's executive order number 79-19,
published in the State Register on March 12, 1979.

of American Indian languages is of vital importance to preserving the American Indian culture.
There have been recent efforts in Minnesota to develop programs to teach the Dakota and Ojibwe
languages to students and to create fluent speakers at both the kindergarten through grade 12 level
and at the postsecondary level. The volunteer working group shall, among other duties, inventory
these efforts and make recommendations regarding how to further revitalize and preserve Dakota
and Ojibwe languages.

represent the American Indian population in Duluth. Other working group members may include, at
their discretion, the commissioner of education or the commissioner's appointee, the director of the
Office of Higher Education or the director's appointee, one member of the Board of Teaching, and the
director of the Minnesota Historical Society or the director's appointee. The working group may add
other members as deemed appropriate by a majority vote of the existing members. The executive
director of the Indian Affairs Council must convene the first meeting no later than September 1,
2009. At the first meeting, the members shall elect from amongst themselves a chair and vice chair
of the working group.
   Subd. 3. Duties. The working group must develop strategies for the 11 federally recognized
American Indian tribes and the state to work together to revitalize and preserve the Dakota and
Ojibwe languages in Minnesota. The duties of the working group include, but are not limited to:
   (1) creating an inventory of existing programs designed to preserve Dakota and Ojibwe
languages in the state, including postsecondary programs, programs in tribal schools, and other
schools throughout the state;
   (2) creating an inventory of available resources for Dakota and Ojibwe language revitalization
and immersion programs, including curriculum, educational materials, and trained teachers;
   (3) identifying curriculum needs to train teachers to teach the Dakota and Ojibwe languages in
immersion programs and barriers to training teachers to teach the Dakota and Ojibwe language;
   (4) identifying classroom curriculum needs for teaching students in Dakota and Ojibwe
languages;
   (5) determining how the identified curriculum needs should be met;

the repository should be located, how it should be structured, and who should have responsibility
for maintaining the repository;

language immersion programs;
   (8) identifying private, state, and national financial resources available to further Dakota and
Ojibwe language revitalization and preservation efforts;

repealed, modified, or waived, in order to further Dakota and Ojibwe language immersion
programs; and
   (10) assessing the level of interest in the community for Dakota and Ojibwe language immersion
programs.
    Subd. 4. Expenses. Members of the group are not eligible for compensation but may receive
reimbursement for their expenses as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 15.059, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 5. Report. The working group must report its findings and recommendations, including
draft legislation, if necessary, to the Indian Affairs Council and the chairs and ranking minority

diem. In reducing the projected adult facility
per diem, the commissioner must consider
the following:
51ST DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009   4557

(4) increasing the use of compassionate
release or less costly detention alternatives
for elderly and infirm offenders;
(5) discontinuing the department's practice
of annually assigning a warden to serve as
a legislative liaison during the legislative
session;
(6) consolidating staff from correctional
institutions in geographical proximity to each
other to achieve efficiencies and cost savings,
including wardens, deputy wardens, and
human resources, technology, and employee
development personnel;
(7) consolidating the department's human
resources, technology, and employee
development functions in a centralized
location;
(8) implementing corrections best practices;
and
(9) implementing cost-saving measures used
by other states and the federal government.
The commissioner must not eliminate
correctional officer positions or implement
any other measure that will jeopardize public
safety to achieve the mandated cost savings.
The commissioner also must not eliminate
treatment beds to achieve the mandated cost
savings.
(d) Per Diem Reduction. If the commissioner
fails to reduce the per diem by one percent,
the commissioner must:
(1) reduce the funding for operations support

4558                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                      [51ST DAY

(2) submit a report by February 15, 2010,
to the chairs and ranking minority members
of the house of representatives and senate
committees with jurisdiction over public
safety policy and finance that contains
descriptions of what efforts the commissioner
made to reduce the per diem, explanations
for why those steps failed to reduce the per
diem by one percent, proposed legislative
options that would assist the commissioner
in reducing the adult facility per diem,
and descriptions of the specific actions the
commissioner took to reduce funding in
operations support.
If the commissioner reduces the per diem
by more than one percent, the commissioner
must use the savings to provide treatment to
offenders.
(e) Reductions to Certain Programming
Prohibited. When allocating reductions
in services and programming under this
appropriation, the commissioner may not
make reductions to inmate educational
programs, chemical dependency programs,
or reentry programs.

prior to June 30, 2009, and housed in
local jails. The commissioner may use up
to ten percent of the total amount of the
appropriation for inpatient medical care
for short-term offenders with less than six
months to serve as affected by the changes
made to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.105,
by Laws 2003, First Special Session chapter
2, article 5, sections 7 to 9. All funds not
expended for inpatient medical care shall be
added to and distributed with the housing
funds. These funds shall be distributed
proportionately based on the total number of
days short-term offenders are placed locally,
not to exceed the fiscal year 2009 per diem.
All funds remaining after reimbursements are
made shall be transferred to the department's
institution base budget to offset the costs
of housing short-term offenders who are
sentenced on or after July 1, 2009, and
incarcerated in state correctional facilities.
Short-term offenders sentenced before July
1, 2009, may be housed in a state correctional
facility at the discretion of the commissioner.
This does not preclude the commissioner
from contracting with local jails to house
offenders committed to the custody of the
commissioner.
The Department of Corrections is exempt
from the state contracting process for the
purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section
609.105, as amended by Laws 2003, First

from the governor whether the vacant office is necessary for effective judicial administration or is
necessary for adequate access to the courts. In determining whether the position is necessary for
adequate access to the courts, the Supreme Court shall consider whether abolition or transfer of the
position would result in a county having no chambered judge. The Supreme Court may continue the
position, may order the position abolished, or may transfer the position to a judicial district where
need for additional judges exists, designating the position as either a county, county/municipal or
district court judgeship. The Supreme Court shall certify any vacancy to the governor, who shall fill
it in the manner provided by law.
     (b) If a judge of district court fails to timely file an affidavit of candidacy and filing fee or
petition in lieu of a fee, the official with whom the affidavits of candidacy are required to be filed
shall notify the Supreme Court that the incumbent judge is not seeking reelection. Within five
days of receipt of the notice, the Supreme Court shall determine whether the judicial position
is necessary for effective judicial administration or adequate access to the courts and notify the
official responsible for certifying the election results of its determination. In determining whether
the position is necessary for adequate access to the courts, the Supreme Court shall consider
whether abolition or transfer of the position would result in a county having no chambered judge.
The Supreme Court may continue the position, may order the position abolished, or may transfer
the position to a judicial district where the need for additional judgeships exists. If the position is
abolished or transferred, the election may not be held. If the position is transferred, the court shall
also notify the governor of the transfer. Upon transfer, the position is vacant and the governor shall
fill it in the manner provided by law. An order abolishing or transferring a position is effective the
first Monday in the next January.

resigns, retires, or is voluntarily removed from the position, the chief judge of the district shall notify

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 2.724, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Procedure. To promote and secure more efficient administration of justice, the chief
justice of the Supreme Court of the state shall supervise and coordinate the work of the courts of the
state. The Supreme Court may provide by rule that the chief justice not be required to write opinions
as a member of the Supreme Court. Its rules may further provide for it to hear and consider cases in
divisions. It may by rule assign temporarily any retired justice of the Supreme Court or one judge
of the Court of Appeals or district court judge at a time to act as a justice of the Supreme Court
or any number of justices or retired justices of the Supreme Court to act as judges of the Court of
Appeals. Upon the assignment of a Court of Appeals judge or a district court judge to act as a justice
of the Supreme Court, a judge previously acting as a justice may complete unfinished duties of that
position. Any number of justices may disqualify themselves from hearing and considering a case,
in which event the Supreme Court may assign temporarily a retired justice of the Supreme Court,
a Court of Appeals judge, or a district court judge to hear and consider the case in place of each
disqualified justice. A       ­­

    Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 480.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10c. Uniform collections policies and procedures for courts. (a) The state court
administrator under the direction of the Judicial Council may promulgate uniform collections
policies and procedures for the courts and may contract with credit bureaus, public and private
collection agencies, the Department of Revenue, and other public or private entities providing
collection services as necessary for the collection of court debts. The court collection process and
procedures are not subject to section 16A.1285. Court debts referred to the Department of Revenue
for collection are not subject to section 16D.07.
    (b) Court debt means an amount owed to the state directly or through the judicial branch on
account of a fee, duty, rent, service, overpayment, fine, assessment, surcharge, court cost, penalty,
restitution, damages, interest, bail bond, forfeiture, reimbursement, liability owed, an assignment
to the judicial branch, recovery of costs incurred by the judicial branch, or any other source of
indebtedness to the judicial branch as well as amounts owed to other public or private entities for
which the judicial branch acts in providing collection services, or any other amount owed to the
judicial branch.
    (c) The courts must pay for the collection services of public or private collection entities as well
as the cost of one or more court employees to provide collection interface services between the
Department of Revenue, the courts, and one or more collection entities from the money collected.
The portion of the money collected which must be paid to the collection entity as collection fees
and costs and the portion of the money collected which must be paid to the courts or Department of
Revenue for collection services are appropriated from the fund to which the collected money is due.
    (d) As determined by the state court administrator, collection costs shall be added to the debts
referred to a public or private collection entity for collection.
   Collection costs shall include the fees of the collection entity, and may include, if separately
provided, skip tracing fees, credit bureau reporting charges, fees assessed by any public entity for
obtaining information necessary for debt collection, or other collection-related costs. Collection
costs shall also include the costs of one or more court employees employed by the state court
administrator to provide a collection interface between the collection entity, the Department of
Revenue, and the courts.
   If the collection entity collects an amount less than the total due, the payment is applied
proportionally to collection costs and the underlying debt. Collection costs in excess of collection
agency fees and court employee collection interface costs must be deposited in the general fund

Conciliation Court Rules, unless the parties have otherwise agreed, if a conciliation court judgment
or a judgment of district court on removal from conciliation court has been docketed in district court,
the judgment creditor's attorney as an officer of the court may or the district court in the county in
which the judgment originated shall, upon request of the judgment creditor, order the judgment
debtor to mail to the judgment creditor information as to the nature, amount, identity, and locations
of all the debtor's assets, liabilities, and personal earning. The information must be provided on a
form prescribed by the Supreme Court, and the information shall be sufficiently detailed to enable
the judgment creditor to obtain satisfaction of the judgment by way of execution on nonexempt
assets and earnings of the judgment debtor. The order must contain a notice that failure to complete
the form and mail it to the judgment creditor within ten days after service of the order may result in
a citation for civil contempt of court. Cash bail posted as a result of being cited for civil contempt of
court order under this section may be ordered payable to the creditor to satisfy the judgment, either
partially or fully.

provided the original or a Minnesota state archives commission approved photographic, photostatic,
microphotographic, microfilmed, or similarly reproduced copy of the original of the following
enumerated documents in the proceeding are on file in the office.
   Enumerated original documents:
    (a) In estates, the jurisdictional petition and proof of publication of the notice of hearing thereof;
will and certificate of probate; letters; inventory and appraisal; orders directing and confirming sale,
mortgage, lease, or for conveyance of real estate; order setting apart statutory selection; receipts for
federal estate taxes and state estate taxes; orders of distribution and general protection; decrees of
distribution; federal estate tax closing letter, consent to discharge by commissioner of revenue and
order discharging representative; and any amendment of the listed documents.
   When an estate is deemed closed as provided in clause (d) of this subdivision, the enumerated
documents shall include all claims of creditors.
    (b) In guardianships or conservatorships, the jurisdictional petition and order for hearing thereof
with proof of service; letters; orders directing and confirming sale, mortgage, lease or for conveyance
of real estate; order for restoration to capacity and order discharging guardian; and any amendment
of the listed documents.
    (c) In mental, inebriety, and indigent matters, the jurisdictional petition; report of examination;
warrant of commitment; notice of discharge from institution, or notice of death and order for
restoration to capacity; and any amendment of the listed documents.
    (d) Except for the enumerated documents described in this subdivision, the court administrator
may destroy all other original documents in any probate proceeding without retaining any
reproduction of the document. For the purpose of this subdivision, a proceeding is deemed closed
if no document has been filed in the proceeding for a period of 15 years, except in the cases of wills
filed for safekeeping and those containing wills of decedents not adjudicated upon.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 549.09, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. When owed; rate. (a) When a judgment or award is for the recovery of money,
including a judgment for the recovery of taxes, interest from the time of the verdict, award, or
report until judgment is finally entered shall be computed by the court administrator or arbitrator as
provided in paragraph (c) and added to the judgment or award.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by contract or allowed by law, preverdict, preaward, or
prereport interest on pecuniary damages shall be computed as provided in paragraph (c) from the
time of the commencement of the action or a demand for arbitration, or the time of a written notice
of claim, whichever occurs first, except as provided herein. The action must be commenced within
two years of a written notice of claim for interest to begin to accrue from the time of the notice
of claim. If either party serves a written offer of settlement, the other party may serve a written
acceptance or a written counteroffer within 30 days. After that time, interest on the judgment or
award shall be calculated by the judge or arbitrator in the following manner. The prevailing party
shall receive interest on any judgment or award from the time of commencement of the action
or a demand for arbitration, or the time of a written notice of claim, or as to special damages
from the time when special damages were incurred, if later, until the time of verdict, award, or

report only if the amount of its offer is closer to the judgment or award than the amount of the
opposing party's offer. If the amount of the losing party's offer was closer to the judgment or award
than the prevailing party's offer, the prevailing party shall receive interest only on the amount
of the settlement offer or the judgment or award, whichever is less, and only from the time of
commencement of the action or a demand for arbitration, or the time of a written notice of claim,
or as to special damages from when the special damages were incurred, if later, until the time
the settlement offer was made. Subsequent offers and counteroffers supersede the legal effect of
earlier offers and counteroffers. For the purposes of clause (2), the amount of settlement offer
must be allocated between past and future damages in the same proportion as determined by the
trier of fact. Except as otherwise provided by contract or allowed by law, preverdict, preaward, or
prereport interest shall not be awarded on the following:
    (1) judgments, awards, or benefits in workers' compensation cases, but not including third-party
actions;
   (2) judgments or awards for future damages;
   (3) punitive damages, fines, or other damages that are noncompensatory in nature;
   (4) judgments or awards not in excess of the amount specified in section 491A.01; and
    (5) that portion of any verdict, award, or report which is founded upon interest, or costs,
disbursements, attorney fees, or other similar items added by the court or arbitrator.
    (c)(1) For a judgment or award of $50,000 or less, the interest shall be computed as simple
interest per annum. The rate of interest shall be based on the secondary market yield of one year
United States Treasury bills, calculated on a bank discount basis as provided in this section.
    On or before the 20th day of December of each year the state court administrator shall determine
the rate from the one-year constant maturity treasury yield for the most recent calendar month,
reported on a monthly basis in the latest statistical release of the board of governors of the Federal
Reserve System. This yield, rounded to the nearest one percent, or four percent, whichever is greater,
shall be the annual interest rate during the succeeding calendar year. The state court administrator
shall communicate the interest rates to the court administrators and sheriffs for use in computing
the interest on verdicts and shall make the interest rates available to arbitrators.
   (2) For a judgment or award over $50,000, the interest rate shall be ten percent per year until
paid.
    (3) When a judgment creditor, or the judgment creditor's attorney or agent, has received a
payment after entry of judgment, whether the payment is made voluntarily by or on behalf of
the judgment debtor, or is collected by legal process other than execution levy where a proper
return has been filed with the court administrator, the judgment creditor, or the judgment creditor's
attorney, before applying to the court administrator for an execution shall file with the court
administrator an affidavit of partial satisfaction. The affidavit must state the dates and amounts of
payments made upon the judgment after the most recent affidavit of partial satisfaction filed, if
any; the part of each payment that is applied to taxable disbursements and to accrued interest and
to the unpaid principal balance of the judgment; and the accrued, but the unpaid interest owing, if
any, after application of each payment.

awards finally entered on or after that date.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 550.011, is amended to read:
   550.011 JUDGMENT DEBTOR DISCLOSURE.
    Unless the parties have otherwise agreed, if a judgment has been docketed in district court for at
least 30 days, and the judgment is not satisfied, the judgment creditor's attorney as an officer of the
court may or the district court in the county in which the judgment originated shall, upon request of
the judgment creditor, order the judgment debtor to mail by certified mail to the judgment creditor
information as to the nature, amount, identity, and locations of all the debtor's assets, liabilities,
and personal earnings. The information must be provided on a form prescribed by the Supreme
Court, and the information shall be sufficiently detailed to enable the judgment creditor to obtain
satisfaction of the judgment by way of execution on nonexempt assets and earnings of the judgment
debtor. The order must contain a notice that failure to complete the form and mail it to the judgment
creditor within ten days after service of the order may result in a citation for civil contempt of court.
Cash bail posted as a result of being cited for civil contempt of court order under this section may
be ordered payable to the creditor to satisfy the judgment, either partially or fully.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.035, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

imprisonment for a violation of any other provision listed in paragraph (e), notwithstanding the fact

sentences contained in section 609.15, subdivision 2, and except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c),
and (f) of this subdivision.
    (b) When a person is being sentenced for a violation of section 171.09, 171.20, 171.24, or 171.30,
the court may not impose a consecutive sentence for another violation of a provision in chapter 171.
   (c) When a person is being sentenced for a violation of section 169.791 or 169.797, the court
may not impose a consecutive sentence for another violation of a provision of sections 169.79 to

    (d) This subdivision does not limit the authority of the court to impose consecutive sentences
for crimes arising on different dates or to impose a consecutive sentence when a person is being
sentenced for a crime and is also in violation of the conditions of a stayed or otherwise deferred
sentence under section 609.135.
     (e) This subdivision applies to misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor violations of the following
if the offender has two or more prior impaired driving convictions as defined in section 169A.03

of an offense listed in paragraph (e), and the offender has five or more qualified prior impaired
driving incidents, as defined in section 169A.03, within the past ten years, the court shall sentence the

determined that a nonrestorative justice diversion program is more appropriate for the person. In
addition, this section does not apply to cases involving domestic violence or domestic assault.

     (c) The court shall collect the fine mandated by this subdivision and forward 70 percent of
it to a local drug abuse prevention or intervention program existing or being implemented in the
county in which the crime was committed. The court shall forward the remaining 30 percent to the
commissioner of finance to be credited to the general fund. If more than one drug abuse prevention or
intervention program serves the county in which the crime was committed, the court may designate
on a case-by-case basis which program will receive the fine proceeds, giving consideration to the
community in which the crime was committed, the funding needs of the program, the number
of peace officers in each community certified to teach the program, and the number of children
served by the program in each community. If no drug abuse prevention or intervention program
serves communities in that county, the court shall forward 100 percent of the fine proceeds to the
commissioner of finance to be credited to the general fund.
    (d) The minimum fines required by this subdivision shall be collected as are other fines. Fine
proceeds received by a local drug abuse prevention or intervention program must be used to support
that program, and may be used for salaries of program staff or peace officers certified to teach
the program. The d   ­­

     Sec. 42. [609.104] FINE AND SURCHARGE COLLECTION.
    Subdivision 1. Failure to pay restitution or fine. (a) Any portion of a fine, surcharge, court
cost, restitution, or fee that the defendant fails to pay by the due date may be referred for collection
under section 480.15, subdivision 10c. If the defendant has agreed to a payment plan but fails to
pay an installment when due, the entire amount remaining becomes due and payable and may be
referred for collection under section 480.15, subdivision 10c.
    (b) The defendant may contest the referral for collection based on inability to pay by requesting
a hearing no later than the due date. The defendant shall be notified in writing at sentencing that
under section 480.15, subdivision 10c, the court may refer the case for collection for nonpayment,
and collection costs may be added to the amount due. The defendant shall also be notified in writing
of the right to contest a referral for collection. The state court administrator shall develop the notice
language.
    Subd. 2. Fine and surcharge collection. (a) A defendant's obligation to pay court-ordered fines,
surcharges, court costs, restitution, and fees shall survive after the due date for a period set by the
Judicial Council.
    (b) Any change in the collection period established by the Judicial Council shall be effective on
court-ordered fines, surcharges, court costs, restitution, and fees imposed on or after the effective
date of this section.
   (c) The period relating to a defendant's obligation to pay restitution under paragraph (a) does not
limit the victim's right to collect restitution through other means such as a civil judgment.
    (d) Nothing in this subdivision extends the period of a defendant's stay of sentence imposition
or execution.

other sentence imposed by the court; or
   (6) to perform work service in a restorative justice program in addition to any other sentence
imposed by the court.
    (b) If the court imposes a fine or orders restitution under paragraph (a), payment is due on the
date imposed unless the court otherwise establishes a due date or a payment plan.
    Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.135, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Terms and conditions. (a) Except when a sentence of life imprisonment is
required by law, or when a mandatory minimum sentence is required by section 609.11, any court
may stay imposition or execution of sentence and:
    (1) may order intermediate sanctions without placing the defendant on probation; or
    (2) may place the defendant on probation with or without supervision and on the terms the court
prescribes, including intermediate sanctions when practicable. The court may order the supervision
to be under the probation officer of the court, or, if there is none and the conviction is for a felony
or gross misdemeanor, by the commissioner of corrections, or in any case by some other suitable
and consenting person. Unless the court directs otherwise, state parole and probation agents and
probation officers may impose community work service or probation violation sanctions, consistent
with section 243.05, subdivision 1; sections 244.196 to 244.199; or 401.02, subdivision 5.
   No intermediate sanction may be ordered performed at a location that fails to observe applicable
requirements or standards of chapter 181A or 182, or any rule promulgated under them.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, subdivision 6, and section 609.14, the term "intermediate
sanctions" includes but is not limited to incarceration in a local jail or workhouse, home detention,
electronic monitoring, intensive probation, sentencing to service, reporting to a day reporting
center, chemical dependency or mental health treatment or counseling, restitution, fines, day-fines,
community work service, work service in a restorative justice program, work in lieu of or to work
off fines and, with the victim's consent, work in lieu of or to work off restitution.
    (c) A court may not stay the revocation of the driver's license of a person convicted of violating
the provisions of section 169A.20.

the payment schedule or structure established by the court or the probation officer, the prosecutor
or the defendant's probation officer may, on the prosecutor's or the officer's own motion or at the
request of the victim, ask the court to hold a hearing to determine whether or not the conditions
of probation should be changed or probation should be revoked. The defendant's probation officer
shall ask for the hearing if the restitution ­

the term of probation expires. The court shall schedule and hold this hearing and take appropriate
action, including action under subdivision 2, paragraph (g), before the defendant's term of probation
expires.
   Nothing in this subdivision limits the court's ability to refer the case to collections under section
609.104 when a defendant fails to pay court-ordered restitution.
    Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.135, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Stay of sentence maximum periods. (a) If the conviction is for a felony other than
section 609.21, subdivision 1a, paragraph (b) or (c), the stay shall be for not more than four years or
the maximum period for which the sentence of imprisonment might have been imposed, whichever
is longer.
    (b) If the conviction is for a gross misdemeanor violation of section 169A.20 or 609.21,
subdivision 1a, paragraph (d), or for a felony described in section 609.21, subdivision 1a, paragraph
(b) or (c), the stay shall be for not more than six years. The court shall provide for unsupervised
probation for the last year of the stay unless the court finds that the defendant needs supervised
probation for all or part of the last year.
    (c) If the conviction is for a gross misdemeanor not specified in paragraph (b), the stay shall be
for not more than two years.
    (d) If the conviction is for any misdemeanor under section 169A.20; 609.746, subdivision 1;
609.79; or 617.23; or for a misdemeanor under section 609.2242 or 609.224, subdivision 1, in which
the victim of the crime was a family or household member as defined in section 518B.01, the stay
shall be for not more than two years. The court shall provide for unsupervised probation for the
second year of the stay unless the court finds that the defendant needs supervised probation for all
or part of the second year.
   (e) If the conviction is for a misdemeanor not specified in paragraph (d), the stay shall be for not
more than one year.
   (f) The defendant shall be discharged six months after the term of the stay expires, unless the stay
has been revoked or extended under paragraph (g), or the defendant has already been discharged.

   (2) the defendant is likely not to complete court-ordered treatment before the term of probation
expires.
   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 611.17, is amended to read:
   611.17 FINANCIAL INQUIRY; STATEMENTS; CO-PAYMENT; STANDARDS FOR
DISTRICT PUBLIC DEFENSE ELIGIBILITY.
   (a) Each judicial district must screen requests for representation by the district public defender.
A defendant is financially unable to obtain counsel if:
   (1) the defendant, or any dependent of the defendant who resides in the same household as the
defendant, receives means-tested governmental benefits; or
    (2) the defendant, through any combination of liquid assets and current income, would be unable
to pay the reasonable costs charged by private counsel in that judicial district for a defense of the
same matter.
    (b) Upon a request for the appointment of counsel, the court shall make appropriate inquiry
into the financial circumstances of the applicant, who shall submit a financial statement under
oath or affirmation setting forth the applicant's assets and liabilities, including the value of any
real property owned by the applicant, whether homestead or otherwise, less the amount of any
encumbrances on the real property, the source or sources of income, and any other information
required by the court. The applicant shall be under a continuing duty while represented by a public
defender to disclose any changes in the applicant's financial circumstances that might be relevant to
the applicant's eligibility for a public defender. The state public defender shall furnish appropriate
forms for the financial statements. The forms must contain conspicuous notice of the applicant's
continuing duty to disclose to the court changes in the applicant's financial circumstances. The
forms must also contain conspicuous notice of the applicant's obligation to make a co-payment
for the services of the district public defender, as specified under paragraph (c). The information
contained in the statement shall be confidential and for the exclusive use of the court and the public
defender appointed by the court to represent the applicant except for any prosecution under section
51ST DAY]                               MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                              4587

609.48. A refusal to execute the financial statement or produce financial records constitutes a
waiver of the right to the appointment of a public defender. The court shall not appoint a district
public defender to a defendant who is financially able to retain private counsel but refuses to do so.
    An inquiry to determine financial eligibility of a defendant for the appointment of the district
public defender shall be made whenever possible prior to the court appearance and by such persons
as the court may direct. This inquiry may be combined with the prerelease investigation provided
for in Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 6.02, subdivision 3. In no case shall the district public
defender be required to perform this inquiry or investigate the defendant's assets or eligibility. The
court has the sole duty to conduct a financial inquiry. The inquiry must include the following:
      (1) the liquidity of real estate assets, including the defendant's homestead;
      (2) any assets that can be readily converted to cash or used to secure a debt;
      (3) the determination of whether the transfer of an asset is voidable as a fraudulent conveyance;
and
   (4) the value of all property transfers occurring on or after the date of the alleged offense. The
burden is on the accused to show that he or she is financially unable to afford counsel. Defendants
who fail to provide information necessary to determine eligibility shall be deemed ineligible. The
court must not appoint the district public defender as advisory counsel.
   (c) Upon disposition of the case, an individual who has received public defender services shall
pay to the court a ­
                   $2
                    ­8­ $75 co-payment for representation provided by a public defender, unless the
co-payment is, or has been, waived by the court.
    The co-payment must be credited to the general fund. If a term of probation is imposed as a part
of an offender's sentence, the co-payment required by this section must not be made a condition
of probation. The co-payment required by this section is a civil obligation and must not be made a
condition of a criminal sentence.
      Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 631.48, is amended to read:
      631.48 SENTENCE; COSTS OF PROSECUTION.
    In a criminal action, upon conviction of the defendant, the court may order as part of the sentence
that defendant shall pay the whole or any part of the disbursements of the prosecution, including
disbursements made to extradite a defendant. The court may order this payment in addition to
any other penalty authorized by law which it may impose. The payment of the disbursements of
prosecution may be enforced in the same manner as the sentence, or by execution against property.
When collected, the disbursements m  ­u­­

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 3.195, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Distribution of reports. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 4, a report to the
legislature required of a department or agency shall be made, unless otherwise specifically required
by law, by filing one copy with the secretary of the senate, one copy with the chief clerk of the house
of representatives, and six copies with the Legislative Reference Library. The same distribution
procedure shall be followed for other reports and publications unless otherwise requested by a
legislator or the Legislative Reference Library.
    (b) A public entity as defined in section 16B.122, shall not distribute a report or publication to
a member or employee of the legislature, except the secretary of the senate, the chief clerk of the
house of representatives, and the Legislative Reference Library, unless the entity has determined that
the member or employee wants the reports or publications published by that entity or the member
or employee has requested the report or publication. This prohibition applies to both mandatory
and voluntary reports and publications. A report or publication may be summarized in an executive
summary and distributed as the entity chooses. Distribution of a report to legislative committee or
commission members during a committee or commission hearing is not prohibited by this section.
    (c) A report or publication produced by a public entity may not be sent to both the home address
and the office address of a representative or senator unless mailing to both addresses is requested
by the representative or senator.
   (d) Reports, publications, periodicals, and summaries under this subdivision must be printed in
a manner consistent with section 16B.122.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 3.195, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Reports of criminal justice agencies; electronic versions only. (a) As used in this
subdivision, "criminal justice agency" means the Departments of Corrections, Public Safety, and
51ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                         4589

Human Rights; the Boards of Public Defense, Peace Officer Standards and Training, Private
Detective and Protective Agent Services, and Judicial Standards; the Sentencing Guidelines and
Uniform Laws Commissions; and the courts.
    (b) A criminal justice agency that submits a report to the legislature under this section shall
do so by submitting an electronic version rather than a printed one. Notwithstanding subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), and section 15.18, the agency need submit only one electronic copy to the Legislative
Reference Library, the State Library, and the Minnesota Historical Society. In addition, the agency
shall submit one printed copy to the Legislative Reference Library.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 152.025, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Sale crimes. (a) A person is guilty of controlled substance crime in the fifth
degree and if convicted may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years or to payment
of a fine of not more than $10,000, or both if:
    (1) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing marijuana or
tetrahydrocannabinols, except a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration; or
    (2) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing a controlled substance classified
in schedule IV.
     (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), if a person is guilty of controlled substance crime in the
fifth degree and the conviction is a subsequent controlled substance conviction, the person convicted
shall be committed to the commissioner of corrections or to a local correctional authority for not
less than six months nor more than ten years and, in addition, may be sentenced to payment of a fine
of not more than $20,000 if:
    (1) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing marijuana or
tetrahydrocannabinols, except a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration; or
    (2) the person unlawfully sells one or more mixtures containing a controlled substance classified
in schedule IV.
    (c) Prior to the time of sentencing, the prosecutor may file a motion to have the person sentenced
without regard to the mandatory minimum sentence established by paragraph (b). The motion must
be accompanied by a statement on the record of the reasons for it. When presented with the motion,
or on its own motion, the court may sentence the person without regard to the mandatory minimum
sentence if the court finds, on the record, substantial and compelling reasons to do so. Sentencing a
person in this manner is a departure from the sentencing guidelines.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009, and applies to crimes committed

of not more than $20,000 if:
    (1) the person unlawfully possesses one or more mixtures containing a controlled substance
classified in schedule I, II, III, or IV, except a small amount of marijuana; or
   (2) the person procures, attempts to procure, possesses, or has control over a controlled substance
by any of the following means:
   (i) fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or subterfuge;

or on its own motion, the court may sentence the person without regard to the mandatory minimum
sentence if the court finds, on the record, substantial and compelling reasons to do so. Sentencing a
person in this manner is a departure from the sentencing guidelines.

on or after that date.

169A.52, 169A.54, or 609.21, must pay a $250 fee plus a $430 surcharge before the driver's license
is reinstated, except as provided in paragraph (f). The $250 fee is to be credited as follows:
51ST DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                       4591

   (1) Twenty percent must be credited to the driver services operating account in the special
revenue fund as specified in section 299A.705.
   (2) Sixty-seven percent must be credited to the general fund.
    (3) Eight percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension account. Money in this account m  ­­ay

of public safety and the appropriated amount must be apportioned 80 percent for laboratory costs
and 20 percent for carrying out the provisions of section 299C.065.
   (4) Five percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the vehicle forfeiture
account, which is created in the special revenue fund. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner for costs of handling vehicle forfeitures.
    (c) The revenue from $50 of the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be
known as the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury account. The revenue from $50 of the
surcharge on a reinstatement under paragraph (f) is credited from the first installment payment to
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury account. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner of health to be used as follows: 83 percent for contracts with a
qualified community-based organization to provide information, resources, and support to assist
persons with traumatic brain injury and their families to access services, and 17 percent to maintain
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registry created in section 144.662. For the
purposes of this paragraph, a "qualified community-based organization" is a private, not-for-profit
organization of consumers of traumatic brain injury services and their family members. The
organization must be registered with the United States Internal Revenue Service under section
501(c)(3) as a tax-exempt organization and must have as its purposes:
   (1) the promotion of public, family, survivor, and professional awareness of the incidence and
consequences of traumatic brain injury;
   (2) the provision of a network of support for persons with traumatic brain injury, their families,
and friends;
   (3) the development and support of programs and services to prevent traumatic brain injury;
   (4) the establishment of education programs for persons with traumatic brain injury; and
   (5) the empowerment of persons with traumatic brain injury through participation in its
governance.
A patient's name, identifying information, or identifiable medical data must not be disclosed to the
organization without the informed voluntary written consent of the patient or patient's guardian or,
if the patient is a minor, of the parent or guardian of the patient.
    (d) The remainder of the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be known as the
remote electronic alcohol-monitoring program account. The commissioner shall transfer the balance
of this account to the commissioner of finance on a monthly basis for deposit in the general fund.
    (e) When these fees are collected by a licensing agent, appointed under section 171.061, a
handling charge is imposed in the amount specified under section 171.061, subdivision 4. The
reinstatement fees and surcharge must be deposited in an approved depository as directed under
4592                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [51ST DAY

section 171.061, subdivision 4.
    (f) A person whose driver's license has been revoked as provided in subdivision 1 under section
169A.52 or 169A.54 and who the court certifies as being financially eligible for a public defender
under section 611.17, may choose to pay 50 percent and an additional $25 of the total amount of the
surcharge and 50 percent of the fee required under paragraph (b) to reinstate the person's driver's
license, provided the person meets all other requirements of reinstatement. If a person chooses to
pay 50 percent of the total and an additional $25, the driver's license must expire after two years. The
person must pay an additional 50 percent less $25 of the total to extend the license for an additional
two years, provided the person is otherwise still eligible for the license. After this final payment
of the surcharge and fee, the license may be renewed on a standard schedule, as provided under
section 171.27. A handling charge may be imposed for each installment payment. Revenue from
the handling charge is credited to the driver services operating account in the special revenue fund
and is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any person making installment payments under paragraph (f), whose driver's license
subsequently expires, or is canceled, revoked, or suspended before payment of 100 percent of the
surcharge and fee, must pay the outstanding balance due for the initial reinstatement before the
driver's license is subsequently reinstated. Upon payment of the outstanding balance due for the
initial reinstatement, the person may pay any new surcharge and fee imposed under paragraph (b)
in installment payments as provided under paragraph (f).

    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.10, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. County fees for background studies and licensing inspections. (a) For purposes of
family and group family child care licensing under this chapter, a county agency may charge a fee
to an applicant or license holder to recover the actual cost of background studies, but in any case not
to exceed $100 annually. A county agency may also charge a license fee to an applicant or license
holder not to exceed $50 for a one-year license or $100 for a two-year license.
    (b) A county agency may charge a fee to a legal nonlicensed child care provider or applicant for
authorization to recover the actual cost of background studies completed under section 119B.125,
but in any case not to exceed $100 annually.
    (c) Counties may elect to reduce or waive the fees in paragraph (a) or (b):
    (1) in cases of financial hardship;
    (2) if the county has a shortage of providers in the county's area;
    (3) for new providers; or
    (4) for providers who have attained at least 16 hours of training before seeking initial licensure.
    (d) Counties may allow providers to pay the applicant fees in paragraph (a) or (b) on an
installment basis for up to one year. If the provider is receiving child care assistance payments from
the state, the provider may have the fees under paragraph (a) or (b) deducted from the child care
assistance payments for up to one year and the state shall reimburse the county for the county fees
collected in this manner.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that the facility is under electronic monitoring; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.
    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.

    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:
   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on-site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on-site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill be to conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
    (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on-site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on-site to respond to

the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the licenser holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to care, health,
and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license holder
to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation of the
foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone call does not meet
this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under
item (i) during the absence of the license holder on-site;
    (iii) the license holder maintains written procedures to dispatch emergency response personnel
to the site in the event of an identified emergency; and
    (iv) each foster care recipient's individualized plan of care, individual service plan under section
256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required, or individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required, identifies the maximum response time, which may
be greater than ten minutes, for the license holder to be on-site for that foster care recipient.
    (f) All placement agreements, individual service agreements, and plans applicable to the foster
care recipient must clearly state that the adult foster care license category is a program without the
presence of a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours; the protocols in place for
responding to situations that present a serious risk to health, safety, or rights of foster care recipients
under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2); and a signed informed consent from each foster care recipient
or the person's legal representative documenting the person's or legal representative's agreement with
placement in the program. If electronic monitoring technology is used in the home, the informed
consent form must also explain the following:
   (1) how any electronic monitoring is incorporated into the alternative supervision system;
   (2) the backup system for any electronic monitoring in times of electrical outages or other
equipment malfunctions;
   (3) how the license holder is trained on the use of the technology;
   (4) the event types and license holder response times established under paragraph (e);
   (5) how the license holder protects the foster care recipient's privacy related to electronic
monitoring and related to any electronically recorded data generated by the monitoring system.
A foster care recipient may not be removed from a program under this subdivision for failure to
consent to electronic monitoring. The consent form must explain where and how the electronically
recorded data is stored, with whom it will be shared, and how long it is retained; and
   (6) the risks and benefits of the alternative overnight supervision system.
    The written explanations under clauses (1) to (6) may be accomplished through cross-references
to other policies and procedures as long as they are explained to the person giving consent, and the
person giving consent is offered a copy.
   (g) Nothing in this section requires the applicant or license holder to develop or maintain separate

or duplicative polices, procedures, documentation, consent forms, or individual plans that may be
required for other licensing standards, if the requirements of this section are incorporated into those
documents.
    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.
    (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (d) through (h), license holder has the meaning under section
245A.2, subdivision 9, and additionally includes all staff, volunteers, and contractors affiliated with
the license holder.
    (j) For the purposes of paragraph (e), the terms "assess" and "assessing" mean to remotely
determine what action the license holder needs to take to protect the well-being of the foster care
recipient.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8b. Adult foster care data privacy and security. (a) An adult foster care license holder
who creates, collects, records, maintains, stores, or discloses any individually identifiable recipient
data, whether in an electronic or any other format, must comply with the privacy and security
provisions of applicable privacy laws and regulations, including:
   (1) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public
Law 104-1; and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part 160, and
subparts A and E of part 164; and
   (2) the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act as codified in chapter 13.
    (b) For purposes of licensure, the license holder shall be monitored for compliance with the
following data privacy and security provisions:
    (1) the license holder must control access to data on foster care recipients according to the
definitions of public and private data on individuals under section 13.02; classification of the data on
individuals as private under section 13.46, subdivision 2; and control over the collection, storage,
use, access, protection, and contracting related to data according to section 13.05, in which the
license holder is assigned the duties of a government entity;
    (2) the license holder must provide each foster care recipient with a notice that meets the
requirements under section 13.04, in which the license holder is assigned the duties of the
government entity, and that meets the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part
164.52. The notice shall describe the purpose for collection of the data, and to whom and why it
may be disclosed pursuant to law. The notice must inform the recipient that the license holder uses
electronic monitoring and, if applicable, that recording technology is used;
   (3) the license holder must not install monitoring cameras in bathrooms;
   (4) electronic monitoring cameras must not be concealed from the foster care recipients; and
    (5) electronic video and audio recordings of foster care recipients shall not be stored by the
license holder for more than five days.
   (c) The commissioner shall develop, and make available to license holders and county licensing

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245C.23, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Commissioner's notice of disqualification that is not set aside. (a) The commissioner
shall notify the license holder of the disqualification and order the license holder to immediately
remove the individual from any position allowing direct contact with persons receiving services
from the license holder if:
   (1) the individual studied does not submit a timely request for reconsideration under section
245C.21;
    (2) the individual submits a timely request for reconsideration, but the commissioner does not
set aside the disqualification for that license holder under section 245C.22;
   (3) an individual who has a right to request a hearing under sections 245C.27 and 256.045, or

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Revised per diem based on legislated rate reduction. Notwithstanding section
252.28, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), if the 2009 legislature adopts a rate reduction that impacts
payment to providers of adult foster care services, the commissioner may issue adult foster care
licenses that permit a capacity of five adults. The application for a five-bed license must meet
the requirements of section 245A.11, subdivision 2a. Prior to admission of the fifth recipient of
adult foster care services, the county must negotiate a revised per diem rate for room and board
and waiver services that reflects the legislated rate reduction and results in an overall average per
diem reduction for all foster care recipients in that home. The revised per diem must allow the
provider to maintain, as much as possible, the level of services or enhanced services provided in
the residence, while mitigating the losses of the legislated rate reduction.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.49, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Cost of services and supports. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that the average
per capita expenditures estimated in any fiscal year for home and community-based waiver
recipients does not exceed the average per capita expenditures that would have been made to
provide institutional services for recipients in the absence of the waiver.
    (b) The commissioner shall implement on January 1, 2002, one or more aggregate, need-based
methods for allocating to local agencies the home and community-based waivered service resources
available to support recipients with disabilities in need of the level of care provided in a nursing
facility or a hospital. The commissioner shall allocate resources to single counties and county
partnerships in a manner that reflects consideration of:
   (1) an incentive-based payment process for achieving outcomes;
   (2) the need for a state-level risk pool;
   (3) the need for retention of management responsibility at the state agency level; and
   (4) a phase-in strategy as appropriate.
    (c) Until the allocation methods described in paragraph (b) are implemented, the annual
allowable reimbursement level of home and community-based waiver services shall be the greater
of:
    (1) the statewide average payment amount which the recipient is assigned under the waiver
reimbursement system in place on June 30, 2001, modified by the percentage of any provider rate

increase appropriated for home and community-based services; or
    (2) an amount approved by the commissioner based on the recipient's extraordinary needs that
cannot be met within the current allowable reimbursement level. The increased reimbursement level
must be necessary to allow the recipient to be discharged from an institution or to prevent imminent
placement in an institution. The additional reimbursement may be used to secure environmental
modifications; assistive technology and equipment; and increased costs for supervision, training,
and support services necessary to address the recipient's extraordinary needs. The commissioner
may approve an increased reimbursement level for up to one year of the recipient's relocation from
an institution or up to six months of a determination that a current waiver recipient is at imminent
risk of being placed in an institution.
    (d) Beginning July 1, 2001, medically necessary private duty nursing services will be authorized
under this section as complex and regular care according to sections 256B.0651 and 256B.0653 to
256B.0656. The rate established by the commissioner for registered nurse or licensed practical nurse
services under any home and community-based waiver as of January 1, 2001, shall not be reduced.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 252.28, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), if the 2009 legislature adopts a
rate reduction that impacts payment to providers of adult foster care services, the commissioner may
issue adult foster care licenses that permit a capacity of five adults. The application for a five-bed
license must meet the requirements of section 245A.11, subdivision 2a. Prior to admission of the fifth
recipient of adult foster care services, the county must negotiate a revised per diem rate for room and
board and waiver services that reflects the legislated rate reduction and results in an overall average
per diem reduction for all foster care recipients in that home. The revised per diem must allow the
provider to maintain, as much as possible, the level of services or enhanced services provided in the
residence, while mitigating the losses of the legislated rate reduction.

   Sec. 20. WAIVER.
    By December 1, 2009, the commissioner shall request all federal approvals and waiver
amendments to the disability home and community-based waivers to allow properly licensed adult
foster care homes to provide residential services for up to five individuals.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.

child care under the child care fund within 30 days of receiving a bill from the provider. Counties
or the state may establish policies that make payments on a more frequent basis.

an eligible family, the bill must be submitted within 60 days of the last date of service on the bill.
A county may pay a bill submitted more than 60 days after the last date of service if the provider
shows good cause why the bill was not submitted within 60 days. Good cause must be defined in
the county's child care fund plan under section 119B.08, subdivision 3, and the definition of good
cause must include county error. A county may not pay any bill submitted more than a year after
the last date of service on the bill.

billing form for an eligible family, payment of child care assistance may only be made retroactively
for a maximum of six months from the date the provider is issued an authorization of care and billing
form.
   (e) A county may stop payment issued to a provider or may refuse to pay a bill submitted by a

119B.035;
    (2) be in an authorized activity for an average of at least 35 hours per week when initial eligibility
is determined; and
    (3) include a child who has not yet entered kindergarten.
    (b) A family who is determined to be eligible to choose an SRSA provider remains eligible to

   (1) the child attends child care with the SRSA provider a minimum of 25 hours per week, on
average;

   (d) A family that moves between counties but continues to use the same SRSA provider shall
continue to receive SRSA funding for the increased payments.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 119B.231, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Requirements of providers. An SRSA must include assessment, evaluation, and
reporting requirements that promote the goals of improved school readiness and movement toward
appropriate child development milestones. A provider who enters into an SRSA shall comply with
all SRSA requirements, including the assessment, evaluation, and reporting requirements in the
SRSA. Providers who have been selected previously for SRSAs must begin the process to obtain
a rating using Parent Aware according to timelines established by the commissioner. If the initial
Parent Aware rating is less than three stars, the provider must submit a plan to improve the rating.
If a 3 or 4 star rating is not obtained within established timelines, the commissioner may consider
continuation of the agreement, depending upon the progress made and other factors. Providers who
apply and are selected for a new SRSA agreement on or after July 1, 2009, must have a level 3 or 4
star rating under the voluntary Parent Aware quality rating system at the time the SRSA agreement
is signed.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 145A.17, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

visitors under this section as MFIP employment and training service providers under section
256J.49, subdivision 4, for MFIP participants who are: (1) ill or incapacitated under section
256J.425, subdivision 2; or (2) minor caregivers under section 256J.54. The county social service
agency and the local public health department may also mutually agree to utilize home visitors to
provide outreach to MFIP families who are being sanctioned or who have been terminated from
MFIP due to the 60-month time limit.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.045, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. State agency hearings. (a) State agency hearings are available for the following:
    (1) any person applying for, receiving or having received public assistance, medical care, or
a program of social services granted by the state agency or a county agency or the federal Food
Stamp Act whose application for assistance is denied, not acted upon with reasonable promptness,
or whose assistance is suspended, reduced, terminated, or claimed to have been incorrectly paid;

     (10) except as provided under chapter 245C, an individual disqualified under sections 245C.14
and 245C.15, on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment; a preponderance of the evidence
that the individual has committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in
section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4; or for failing to make reports required under section 626.556,
subdivision 3, or 626.557, subdivision 3. Hearings regarding a maltreatment determination under
clause (4) or (9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for a disqualification
is serious or recurring maltreatment, which has not been set aside under sections 245C.22 and
245C.23, shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of review by the
human services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be a bar to a hearing
under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to dispute a finding
of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest the specified
action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written request for a
hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action, decision,
or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or
relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time limit.     ­; or

care, or the federal Food Stamp Act who is contesting a setoff claim by the Department of Human
Services or a county agency. The scope of the appeal is the validity of the claimant agency's intention
to request a setoff of a refund under chapter 270A against the debt.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.

    (d) The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under paragraph (a), clause
(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement
under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care
payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.
   (e) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.
   (f) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (g) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.983, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Programs established. Within the limits of available appropriations, the
commissioner of human services shall require the maintenance of budget neutral fraud prevention
investigation programs in the counties participating in the fraud prevention investigation project
established under this section. If funds are sufficient, the commissioner may also extend fraud
prevention investigation programs to other counties provided the expansion is budget neutral to
the state. Under any expansion, the commissioner has the final authority in decisions regarding the
creation and realignment of individual county or regional operations.

suitable employment. For purposes of the initial approval of a learning disability extension, the
determination must have been made or confirmed within the previous 12 months. In the case of a
non-English-speaking person: (i) the determination must be made by a qualified professional with
experience conducting culturally appropriate assessments, whenever possible; and (ii) these reports
must include a statement of confidence in the results. If a rehabilitation plan for a participant
extended as learning disabled is developed or approved by the county agency, the plan must
be incorporated into the employment plan. However, a rehabilitation plan does not replace the
requirement to develop and comply with an employment plan under section 256J.521; or
  (4) a person who has been granted a family violence waiver, and who is complying with an
employment plan under section 256J.521, subdivision 3.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable
employment" means that a qualified professional has determined that the person's condition prevents
the person from working 20 or more hours per week.

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.521, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Employment plan; contents. (a) Based on the assessment under subdivision 1, the
job counselor and the participant must develop an employment plan that includes participation in
activities and hours that meet the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1. The purpose of the
employment plan is to identify for each participant the most direct path to unsubsidized employment
and any subsequent steps that support long-term economic stability. The employment plan should
be developed using the highest level of activity appropriate for the participant. Activities must be
chosen from clauses (1) to (6), which are listed in order of preference. Notwithstanding this order
of preference for activities, priority must be given for activities related to a family violence waiver
when developing the employment plan. The employment plan must also list the specific steps the
participant will take to obtain employment, including steps necessary for the participant to progress
from one level of activity to another, and a timetable for completion of each step. Levels of activity
include:
   (1) unsubsidized employment;
   (2) job search;
   (3) subsidized employment or unpaid work experience;
   (4) unsubsidized employment and job readiness education or job skills training;
    (5) unsubsidized employment or unpaid work experience and activities related to a family
violence waiver or preemployment needs; and
   (6) activities related to a family violence waiver or preemployment needs.
   (b) Participants who are determined to possess sufficient skills such that the participant is likely

to succeed in obtaining unsubsidized employment must job search at least 30 hours per week for up
to six weeks and accept any offer of suitable employment. The remaining hours necessary to meet
the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1, may be met through participation in other work
activities under section 256J.49, subdivision 13. The participant's employment plan must specify, at
a minimum: (1) whether the job search is supervised or unsupervised; (2) support services that will
be provided; and (3) how frequently the participant must report to the job counselor. Participants
who are unable to find suitable employment after six weeks must meet with the job counselor to
determine whether other activities in paragraph (a) should be incorporated into the employment
plan. Job search activities which are continued after six weeks must be structured and supervised.

    (d
     ­­) Participants who are determined to have barriers to obtaining or retaining employment that
will not be overcome during six weeks of job search under paragraph (b) must work with the job
counselor to develop an employment plan that addresses those barriers by incorporating appropriate
activities from paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6). The employment plan must include enough hours
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, unless a compelling reason
to require fewer hours is noted in the participant's file.
   (­

agreement on the contents.

in the plan, or voluntarily quitting suitable employment without good cause, will result in the
imposition of a sanction under section 256J.46.

   (­
    g­) (f) When a participant fails to meet the agreed upon hours of participation in paid
employment because the participant is not eligible for holiday pay and the participant's place of
employment is closed for a holiday, the job counselor shall not impose a sanction or increase the
hours of participation in any other activity, including paid employment, to offset the hours that
were missed due to the holiday.
    ­
    (­
     h­) (g) Employment plans must be reviewed at least every three months to determine whether
activities and hourly requirements should be revised. The job counselor is encouraged to allow
participants who are participating in at least 20 hours of work activities to also participate in
education and training activities in order to meet the federal hourly participation rates.

employment services provider must inform the participant of the right to bring an advocate to the
face-to-face meeting.
    During the face-to-face meeting, the county agency shall:
   (1) determine whether the continued noncompliance can be explained and mitigated by
providing a needed family stabilization service, as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
    (2) determine whether the participant qualifies for a good cause exception under section 256J.57,
or if the sanction is for noncooperation with child support requirements, determine if the participant
qualifies for a good cause exemption under section 256.741, subdivision 10;
   (3) determine whether activities in the family stabilization plan are appropriate based on the
family's circumstances;
    (4) explain the consequences of continuing noncompliance;
   (5) identify other resources that may be available to the participant to meet the needs of the
family; and
    (6) inform the participant of the right to appeal under section 256J.40.

work with the participant to provide the identified activity.
   (d) If the participant fails to come to the face-to-face meeting, the case manager or a designee
shall attempt at least one home visit. If a face-to-face meeting is not conducted, the county agency
shall send the participant a written notice that includes the information under paragraph (c).
    (e) After the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) are met and prior to imposition of a sanction,
the county agency shall provide a notice of intent to sanction under section 256J.57, subdivision 2,
and, when applicable, a notice of adverse action under section 256J.31.
   (f) Section 256J.57 applies to this section except to the extent that it is modified by this
subdivision.

    (b) To be eligible for work participation cash benefits, the participant shall not receive MFIP
or diversionary work program assistance during the month and the participant or participants must
meet the following work requirements:
  (1) if the participant is a single caregiver and has a child under six years of age, the participant
must be employed at least 87 hours per month;

participant must be employed at least 130 hours per month; or
   (3) if the household is a two-parent family, at least one of the parents must be employed an

    (d) A participant who is determined to be unlikely to benefit from the diversionary work
program shall be converted to MFIP and, if the determination was made within 30 days of the
initial application for benefits, no additional application form is required. A participant who is
determined to be unlikely to benefit from the diversionary work program shall be referred to MFIP
and, if the determination is made more than 30 days after the initial application, the participant
must submit a program change request form. The county agency shall process the program change
request form by the first of the following month to ensure that no gap in benefits is due to delayed
action by the county agency. In processing the program change request form, the county must
follow section 256J.32, subdivision 1, except that the county agency shall not require additional
verification of the information in the case file from the DWP application unless the information in
the case file is inaccurate, questionable, or no longer current.
    (e) The county shall not request a combined application form for a participant who has
exhausted the four months of the diversionary work program, has continued need for cash and food
assistance, and has completed, signed, and submitted a program change request form within 30
days of the fourth month of the diversionary work program. The county must process the program
change request according to section 256J.32, subdivision 1, except that the county agency shall not
require additional verification of information in the case file unless the information is inaccurate,
questionable, or no longer current. When a participant does not request MFIP within 30 days of
the diversionary work program benefits being exhausted, a new combined application form must
be completed for any subsequent request for MFIP.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective March 1, 2010.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.95, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Immediate referral to employment services. Within one working day of
determination that the applicant is eligible for the diversionary work program, but before benefits
are issued to or on behalf of the family unit, the county shall refer all caregivers to employment
services. The referral to the DWP employment services must be in writing and must contain the
following information:
  (1) notification that, as part of the application process, applicants are required to develop an
employment plan or the DWP application will be denied;
   (2) the employment services provider name and phone number;

    Subdivision 1. Procedures. The commissioner shall determine or redetermine, if necessary,
what amount of the cost of care, if any, the client is able to pay. The client shall provide to the
commissioner documents and proof necessary to determine the ability to pay. Failure to provide the
commissioner with sufficient information to determine ability to pay may make the client liable for
the full cost of care until the time when sufficient information is provided.
    Subd. 2. Rules. The commissioner shall use the standards in section 246.51, subdivision 2, to
determine the client's liability for the care provided by the Minnesota sex offender program.

provided to the client, less the amount actually paid toward the cost of care by the client, must be
filed by the commissioner as a claim against the estate of the client with the court having jurisdiction
to probate the estate, and all proceeds collected by the state in the case must be divided between the
state and county in proportion to the cost of care each has borne.
    Subd. 2. Preferred status. An estate claim in subdivision 1 must be considered an expense of
the last illness for purposes of section 524.3-805.
    If the commissioner determines that the property or estate of a client is not more than needed
to care for and maintain the spouse and minor or dependent children of a deceased client, the
commissioner has the power to compromise the claim of the state in a manner deemed just and
proper.
    Subd. 3. Exception from statute of limitations. Any statute of limitations that limits the
commissioner in recovering the cost of care obligation incurred by a client or former client must
not apply to any claim against an estate made under this section to recover cost of care.

of care, as determined by the commissioner, for each day or portion of a day, that the client spends
at the facility. If payments received by the state under this chapter exceed 90 percent of the cost of
care, the county is responsible for paying the state the remaining amount. The county is not entitled
to reimbursement from the client, the client's estate, or from the client's relatives, except as provided
in section 246B.07.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.122, is amended to read:
   144.122 LICENSE, PERMIT, AND SURVEY FEES.
    (a) The state commissioner of health, by rule, may prescribe procedures and fees for filing with
the commissioner as prescribed by statute and for the issuance of original and renewal permits,
licenses, registrations, and certifications issued under authority of the commissioner. The expiration
dates of the various licenses, permits, registrations, and certifications as prescribed by the rules
shall be plainly marked thereon. Fees may include application and examination fees and a penalty
fee for renewal applications submitted after the expiration date of the previously issued permit,
license, registration, and certification. The commissioner may also prescribe, by rule, reduced fees
for permits, licenses, registrations, and certifications when the application therefor is submitted
during the last three months of the permit, license, registration, or certification period. Fees proposed
to be prescribed in the rules shall be first approved by the Department of Finance. All fees proposed
to be prescribed in rules shall be reasonable. The fees shall be in an amount so that the total fees
collected by the commissioner will, where practical, approximate the cost to the commissioner in
administering the program. All fees collected shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited
to the state government special revenue fund unless otherwise specifically appropriated by law for
specific purposes.
    (b) The commissioner may charge a fee for voluntary certification of medical laboratories and

                                            ) The commissioner shall develop and implement a
pay-for-performance system to provide performance payments to eligible medical groups and
clinics that demonstrate optimum care in serving individuals with chronic diseases who are enrolled
in health care programs administered by the commissioner under chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L.
The commissioner may receive any federal matching money that is made available through the
medical assistance program for managed care oversight contracted through vendors, including
consumer surveys, studies, and external quality reviews as required by the federal Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part 438-managed care, subpart E-external
quality review. Any federal money received for managed care oversight is appropriated to the
commissioner for this purpose. The commissioner may expend the federal money received in either
year of the biennium.

     Sec. 10. [256.964] DENTAL CARE PILOT PROJECTS.
    The commissioner shall authorize pilot projects to reduce the total cost to the state for dental
services provided to enrollees of the state public health care programs by reducing hospital
emergency room costs for preventable or nonemergency dental services. As part of the project,
a community dental clinic or dental provider, in collaboration with a hospital emergency room,
shall provide urgent care dental services as an alternative to the hospital emergency room for
nonemergency dental care. The project participants shall establish a process to divert a patient
presenting at the emergency room for nonemergency dental care to the dental community clinic or
to an appropriate dental provider. The commissioner may establish special payment rates for urgent
care services provided and may change or waive existing payment policies in order to adequately
reimburse providers for providing cost-effective alternative services in an outpatient or urgent care
setting. The commissioner may establish a project in conjunction with the initiative authorized
under section 256.963.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Operating payment rates. In determining operating payment rates for admissions
occurring on or after the rate year beginning January 1, 1991, and every two years after, or more
frequently as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain operating data from
an updated base year and establish operating payment rates per admission for each hospital based on
the cost-finding methods and allowable costs of the Medicare program in effect during the base year.
Rates under the general assistance medical care, medical assistance, and MinnesotaCare programs
shall not be rebased to more current data on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2005, ­  an
                                                                                   ­d­ for the first 24
months of the rebased period beginning January 1, 2009, and for the first three months of the rebased
period beginning January 1, 2011. From April 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, rates shall be rebased
at 39.2 percent of the full value of the rebasing percentage change. Effective April 1, 2012, rates
shall be rebased at full value. The base year operating payment rate per admission is standardized
by the case mix index and adjusted by the hospital cost index, relative values, and disproportionate
population adjustment. The cost and charge data used to establish operating rates shall only reflect
inpatient services covered by medical assistance and shall not include property cost information and

costs recognized in outlier payments.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.
    (d) In addition to the reduction in paragraphs (b) and (c), the total payment for fee-for-service
admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2005, made to hospitals for inpatient services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 6.0 percent from the current statutory rates. Mental
health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision

1, 2006, to reflect this reduction.
    (e) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 3.46 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432
and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to
managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2009, through
June 30, 2009, to reflect this reduction.
    (f) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 1.9 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432
and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to
managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after July 1, 2009, through June
30, 2010, to reflect this reduction.
    (g) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2010, made to hospitals for inpatient
services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 1.79 percent from the current
statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities
defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to managed care
plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after July 1, 2010, to reflect this reduction.
    (h) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), the total payment
for fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2009, made to hospitals for inpatient
services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced one percent from the current
statutory rates. Facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after October 1, 2009, to
reflect this reduction.

    Subd. 3b. Nonpayment for hospital-acquired conditions and for certain treatments. (a) The
commissioner must not make medical assistance payments to a hospital for any costs of care that
result from a condition listed in paragraph (c), if the condition was hospital acquired.

       Sec. 16. [256B.032] ELIGIBLE VENDORS OF MEDICAL CARE.
    (a) Effective January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall establish performance thresholds for health
care providers included in the provider peer grouping system developed by the commissioner of

    (1) a physician certifies that the person is expected to reside in the long-term care facility for
three calendar months or less;
      (2) if the person has expenses of maintaining a residence in the community; and
      (3) if one of the following circumstances apply:
    (i) the person was not living together with a spouse or a family member as defined in paragraph

For purposes of this paragraph, a person is determined to be residing in a licensed nursing home,
regional treatment center, or medical institution if the person is expected to remain for a period of
one full calendar month or more.
    Subd. 2. Reasonable expenses. For the purposes of subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (9),
reasonable expenses are limited to expenses that have not been previously used as a deduction from
income and were not:
   (1) for long-term care expenses incurred during a period of ineligibility as defined in section
256B.0595, subdivision 2;
    (2) incurred more than three months before the month of application associated with the current
period of eligibility;
   (3) for expenses incurred by a recipient that are duplicative of services that are covered under
chapter 256B; or
   (4) nursing facility expenses incurred without a timely assessment as required under section
256B.0911.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited transfers. (a) For transfers of assets made on or before August 10,
1993, if an institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse has given away, sold, or
disposed of, for less than fair market value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the
homestead that are excluded under the supplemental security program, within 30 months before or
any time after the date of institutionalization if the person has been determined eligible for medical
assistance, or within 30 months before or any time after the date of the first approved application
for medical assistance if the person has not yet been determined eligible for medical assistance, the
person is ineligible for long-term care services for the period of time determined under subdivision
2.
    (b) Effective for transfers made after August 10, 1993, an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or institutionalized person's spouse, may not give away, sell, or dispose of, for less than fair market
value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the homestead that are excluded under
the Supplemental Security Income program, for the purpose of establishing or maintaining medical
assistance eligibility. This applies to all transfers, including those made by a community spouse
after the month in which the institutionalized spouse is determined eligible for medical assistance.
For purposes of determining eligibility for long-term care services, any transfer of such assets
within 36 months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, or 36 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, for less than fair market value may be considered.
Any such transfer is presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing or maintaining
medical assistance eligibility and the institutionalized person is ineligible for long-term care
services for the period of time determined under subdivision 2, unless the institutionalized person
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose,
or unless the transfer is permitted under subdivision 3 or 4. In the case of payments from a trust
or portions of a trust that are considered transfers of assets under federal law, or in the case of

any other disposal of assets made on or after February 8, 2006, any transfers made within 60
months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance payment
of long-term care services and within 60 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, may be considered.
    (c) This section applies to transfers, for less than fair market value, of income or assets, including
assets that are considered income in the month received, such as inheritances, court settlements, and
retroactive benefit payments or income to which the institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse is entitled but does not receive due to action by the institutionalized person, the
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse.
    (d) This section applies to payments for care or personal services provided by a relative, unless
the compensation was stipulated in a notarized, written agreement which was in existence when
the service was performed, the care or services directly benefited the person, and the payments
made represented reasonable compensation for the care or services provided. A notarized written
agreement is not required if payment for the services was made within 60 days after the service was
provided.
    (e) This section applies to the portion of any asset or interest that an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse, transfers to any annuity that exceeds the value of the benefit
likely to be returned to the institutionalized person or institutionalized person's spouse while alive,
based on estimated life expectancy as determined according to the current actuarial tables published
by the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. The commissioner may
adopt rules reducing life expectancies based on the need for long-term care. This section applies to
an annuity purchased on or after March 1, 2002, that:
    (1) is not purchased from an insurance company or financial institution that is subject to licensing
or regulation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce or a similar regulatory agency of another
state;
   (2) does not pay out principal and interest in equal monthly installments; or
   (3) does not begin payment at the earliest possible date after annuitization.
    (f) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person who has applied for or is receiving long-term
care services or the institutionalized person's spouse shall be treated as the disposal of an asset
for less than fair market value unless the department is named a preferred remainder beneficiary
as described in section 256B.056, subdivision 11. Any subsequent change to the designation of the
department as a preferred remainder beneficiary shall result in the annuity being treated as a disposal
of assets for less than fair market value. The amount of such transfer shall be the maximum amount
the institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse could receive from the annuity or
similar financial instrument. Any change in the amount of the income or principal being withdrawn
from the annuity or other similar financial instrument at the time of the most recent disclosure shall
be deemed to be a transfer of assets for less than fair market value unless the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse demonstrates that the transaction was for fair market value. In
51ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                         4675

the event a distribution of income or principal has been improperly distributed or disbursed from an
annuity or other retirement planning instrument of an institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse, a cause of action exists against the individual receiving the improper distribution
for the cost of medical assistance services provided or the amount of the improper distribution,
whichever is less.
    (g) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person applying for or receiving long-term care
services shall be treated as a disposal of assets for less than fair market value unless it is:
   (i) an annuity described in subsection (b) or (q) of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986; or
   (ii) purchased with proceeds from:
   (A) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
   (B) a simplified employee pension within the meaning of section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code; or
   (C) a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (iii) an annuity that is irrevocable and nonassignable; is actuarially sound as determined in
accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration; and provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity, with
no deferral and no balloon payments made.
    (h) For purposes of this section, long-term care services include services in a nursing facility,
services that are eligible for payment according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 2, because they
are provided in a swing bed, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
and home and community-based services provided pursuant to sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and
256B.49. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, "institutionalized person"
includes a person who is an inpatient in a nursing facility or in a swing bed, or intermediate care
facility for persons with developmental disabilities or who is receiving home and community-based
services under sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and 256B.49.
    (i) This section applies to funds used to purchase a promissory note, loan, or mortgage unless
the note, loan, or mortgage:
   (1) has a repayment term that is actuarially sound;
   (2) provides for payments to be made in equal amounts during the term of the loan, with no
deferral and no balloon payments made; and
   (3) prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the lender.
    In the case of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage that does not meet an exception in clauses (1)
to (3), the value of such note, loan, or mortgage shall be the outstanding balance due as of the date
of the institutionalized person's request for medical assistance payment of long-term care services.
   (j) This section applies to the purchase of a life estate interest in another person's home unless
4676                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [51ST DAY

the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of purchase.
     (k) This section applies to transfers into a pooled trust that qualifies under United States Code,
title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(C), by:
   (1) a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse; or
    (2) any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority to act in place of, on behalf of,
at the direction of, or upon the request of a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Period of ineligibility for long-term care services. (a) For any uncompensated transfer
occurring on or before August 10, 1993, the number of months of ineligibility for long-term care
services shall be the lesser of 30 months, or the uncompensated transfer amount divided by the
average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state in effect on the date of
application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance payment rate shall be
adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year. The period of ineligibility
begins with the month in which the assets were transferred. If the transfer was not reported to the
local agency at the time of application, and the applicant received long-term care services during
what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause of action
exists against the transferee for the cost of long-term care services provided during the period of
ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The uncompensated
transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed
of, less the amount of compensation received.
     (b) For uncompensated transfers made after August 10, 1993, the number of months of
ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the total uncompensated value of the resources
transferred divided by the average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state
in effect on the date of application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance
payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year.
The period of ineligibility begins with the first day of the month after the month in which the assets
were transferred except that if one or more uncompensated transfers are made during a period
of ineligibility, the total assets transferred during the ineligibility period shall be combined and
a penalty period calculated to begin on the first day of the month after the month in which the
first uncompensated transfer was made. If the transfer was reported to the local agency after the
date that advance notice of a period of ineligibility that affects the next month could be provided
to the recipient and the recipient received medical assistance services or the transfer was not
reported to the local agency, and the applicant or recipient received medical assistance services
during what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause
of action exists against the transferee for that portion of long-term care services provided during
the period of ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The
uncompensated transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away,
sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. Effective for transfers made on
or after March 1, 1996, involving persons who apply for medical assistance on or after April 13,
1996, no cause of action exists for a transfer unless:
    (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was a resident of a long-term care facility or was receiving that level of care in the community at
the time of the transfer;
51ST DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                           4677

   (2) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made to assist the
person to qualify for or retain medical assistance eligibility; or
    (3) the transferee actively solicited the transfer with intent to assist the person to qualify for or
retain eligibility for medical assistance.
   (c) For uncompensated transfers made on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility:
    (1) for uncompensated transfers by or on behalf of individuals receiving medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, begins the first day of the month following advance notice of
    p­
the ­ ­­
     en a­t
         l­y­ period of ineligibility, but no later than the first day of the month that follows three full
calendar months from the date of the report or discovery of the transfer; or
    (2) for uncompensated transfers by individuals requesting medical assistance payment of
long-term care services, begins the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance
under the Medicaid state plan and would otherwise be receiving long-term care services based on
an approved application for such care but for the­

resulting from the uncompensated transfer; and

   (d) If a calculation of a ­  ­­
                               en a­t
                                   l­y­ period of ineligibility results in a partial month, payments for
long-term care services shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fraction.
    (e) In the case of multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than one month for less than
fair market value on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility is calculated by treating
the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred during all months on or after
February 8, 2006, as one transfer.
    (f) A period of ineligibility established under paragraph (c) may be eliminated if all of the assets
transferred for less than fair market value used to calculate the period of ineligibility, or cash equal
to the value of the assets at the time of the transfer, are returned within 12 months after the date
the period of ineligibility began. A period of ineligibility must not be adjusted if less than the full
amount of the transferred assets or the full cash value of the transferred assets are returned.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for periods of ineligibility established on or after
January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

51ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                          4683

specifically used to enhance fertility, if prescribed by a licensed practitioner and dispensed by a
licensed pharmacist, by a physician enrolled in the medical assistance program as a dispensing
physician, or by a physician, physician assistant, or a nurse practitioner employed by or under
contract with a community health board as defined in section 145A.02, subdivision 5, for the
purposes of communicable disease control.
   (b) The dispensed quantity of a prescription drug must not exceed a 34-day supply, unless
authorized by the commissioner.
    (c) Medical assistance covers the following over-the-counter drugs when prescribed by
a licensed practitioner or by a licensed pharmacist who meets standards established by the
commissioner, in consultation with the board of pharmacy: antacids, acetaminophen, family
planning products, aspirin, insulin, products for the treatment of lice, vitamins for adults with
documented vitamin deficiencies, vitamins for children under the age of seven and pregnant or
nursing women, and any other over-the-counter drug identified by the commissioner, in consultation
with the formulary committee, as necessary, appropriate, and cost-effective for the treatment of
certain specified chronic diseases, conditions, or disorders, and this determination shall not be
subject to the requirements of chapter 14. A pharmacist may prescribe over-the-counter medications
as provided under this paragraph for purposes of receiving reimbursement under Medicaid. When
prescribing over-the-counter drugs under this paragraph, licensed pharmacists must consult with
the recipient to determine necessity, provide drug counseling, review drug therapy for potential
adverse interactions, and make referrals as needed to other health care professionals.
    (d) Effective January 1, 2006, medical assistance shall not cover drugs that are coverable under
Medicare Part D as defined in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003, Public Law 108-173, section 1860D-2(e), for individuals eligible for drug coverage as
defined in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Public
Law 108-173, section 1860D-1(a)(3)(A). For these individuals, medical assistance may cover drugs
from the drug classes listed in United States Code, title 42, section 1396r-8(d)(2), subject to this
subdivision and subdivisions 13a to 13g, except that drugs listed in United States Code, title 42,
section 1396r-8(d)(2)(E), shall not be covered.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13e. Payment rates. (a) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the
lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable
cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the
usual and customary price charged to the public. The amount of payment basis must be reduced
to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any provider/insurer agreement or contract
for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater
than the patient liability for the service. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.65, except that
the dispensing fee for intravenous solutions which must be compounded by the pharmacist shall
be $8 per bag, $14 per bag for cancer chemotherapy products, and $30 per bag for total parenteral
nutritional products dispensed in one liter quantities, or $44 per bag for total parenteral nutritional
products dispensed in quantities greater than one liter. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity
and other special discounts except time and cash discounts. Effective July 1, 2   ­0­0
                                                                                     ­8­ 2009, the actual
acquisition cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus
­­
1 4 15 percent. The actual acquisition cost of antihemophilic factor drugs shall be estimated at the
average wholesale price minus 30 percent. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug

may be set by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum
amount paid by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs.
Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act.
    (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists
for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.
    (c) Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the
actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, or on the maximum allowable cost established by the
commissioner.
    (d) The basis for determining the amount of payment for drugs administered in an outpatient
setting shall be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider or the amount
established for Medicare by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant
to title XVIII, section 1847a of the federal Social Security Act.
    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of
cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology
drugs, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex care. The commissioner shall consult
with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty pharmacy products subject to this
paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in developing this list, the commissioner
shall take into consideration the population served by specialty pharmacy products, the current
delivery system and standard of care in the state, and access to care issues. The commissioner shall
have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate to prevent access to care issues.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13h, is amended to read:

medication-related problems, including adverse drug events;
   (5) documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to the patient's
other primary care providers;
   (6) providing verbal education and training designed to enhance patient understanding and
appropriate use of the patient's medications;
   (7) providing information, support services, and resources designed to enhance patient adherence
with the patient's therapeutic regimens; and
   (8) coordinating and integrating medication therapy management services within the broader

pharmacist as defined in section 151.01, subdivision 27.
    (b) To be eligible for reimbursement for services under this subdivision, a pharmacist must meet
the following requirements:
   (1) have a valid license issued under chapter 151;

    (3) be practicing in an ambulatory care setting as part of a multidisciplinary team or have
developed a structured patient care process that is offered in a private or semiprivate patient care
area that is separate from the commercial business that also occurs in the setting, or in home settings,
excluding long-term care and group homes, if the service is ordered by the provider-directed care
coordination team; and
   (4) make use of an electronic patient record system that meets state standards.
   (c) For purposes of reimbursement for medication therapy management services, the
commissioner may enroll individual pharmacists as medical assistance and general assistance
medical care providers. The commissioner may also establish contact requirements between the
pharmacist and recipient, including limiting the number of reimbursable consultations per recipient.

    (d) The commissioner shall establish a pilot project for an intensive medication therapy
management program for patients identified by the commissioner with multiple chronic conditions
and a high number of medications who are at high risk of preventable hospitalizations, emergency
room use, medication complications, and suboptimal treatment outcomes due to medication-related
problems. For purposes of the pilot project, medication therapy management services may be
provided in a patient's home or community setting, in addition to other authorized settings. The
commissioner may waive existing payment policies and establish special payment rates for the
pilot project. The pilot project must be designed to produce a net savings to the state compared to
the estimated costs that would otherwise be incurred for similar patients without the program.

    Subd. 17. Transportation costs. (a) Medical assistance covers medical transportation costs
incurred solely for obtaining emergency medical care or transportation costs incurred by eligible
persons in obtaining emergency or nonemergency medical care when paid directly to an ambulance

   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17a. Payment for ambulance services. Medical assistance covers ambulance services.
Providers shall bill ambulance services according to Medicare criteria. Nonemergency ambulance
services shall not be paid as emergencies. Effective for services rendered on or after July 1, 2001,

rate or at the medical assistance payment rate in effect on July 1, 2000, whichever is greater.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:

   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 25a. Prior authorization of diagnostic imaging services. (a) Effective January 1,
2010, the commissioner shall require prior authorization or decision support for the ordering
providers at the time the service is ordered for the following outpatient diagnostic imaging
services: computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA), positive emission tomography (PET), cardiac imaging and ultrasound
diagnostic imaging.
    (b) Prior authorization under this subdivision is not required for diagnostic imaging services
performed as part of a hospital emergency room visit, inpatient hospitalization, or if concurrent
with or on the same day as an urgent care facility visit.
   (c) This subdivision does not apply to services provided to recipients who are enrolled in
Medicare, the prepaid medical assistance program, the prepaid general assistance medical care
program, or the MinnesotaCare program.
    (d) The commissioner may contract with a private entity to provide the prior authorization or
decision support required under this subdivision. The contracting entity must incorporate clinical
guidelines that are based on evidence-based medical literature, if available. By January 1, 2012,
the contracting entity shall report to the commissioner the results of prior authorization or decision
support.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Special education services. (a) Medical assistance covers medical services identified
in a recipient's individualized education plan and covered under the medical assistance state
plan. Covered services include occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language therapy,
clinical psychological services, nursing services, school psychological services, school social
work services, personal care assistants serving as management aides, assistive technology devices,
transportation services, health assessments, and other services covered under the medical assistance
state plan. Mental health services eligible for medical assistance reimbursement must be provided
or coordinated through a children's mental health collaborative where a collaborative exists if the
child is included in the collaborative operational target population. The provision or coordination
of services does not require that the individual education plan be developed by the collaborative.
     The services may be provided by a Minnesota school district that is enrolled as a medical
assistance provider or its subcontractor, and only if the services meet all the requirements otherwise
applicable if the service had been provided by a provider other than a school district, in the
following areas: medical necessity, physician's orders, documentation, personnel qualifications,
and prior authorization requirements. The nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this
subdivision is the responsibility of the local school district as provided in section 125A.74. Services
listed in a child's individual education plan are eligible for medical assistance reimbursement only
if those services meet criteria for federal financial participation under the Medicaid program.
   (b) Approval of health-related services for inclusion in the individual education plan does not
require prior authorization for purposes of reimbursement under this chapter. The commissioner
may require physician review and approval of the plan not more than once annually or upon any
modification of the individual education plan that reflects a change in health-related services.

   (c) Services of a speech-language pathologist provided under this section are covered
notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0390, subpart 1, item L, if the person:
   (1) holds a masters degree in speech-language pathology;
   (2) is licensed by the Minnesota Board of Teaching as an educational speech-language
pathologist; and
    (3) either has a certificate of clinical competence from the American Speech and Hearing
Association, has completed the equivalent educational requirements and work experience necessary
for the certificate or has completed the academic program and is acquiring supervised work
experience to qualify for the certificate.
    (d) Medical assistance coverage for medically necessary services provided under other
subdivisions in this section may not be denied solely on the basis that the same or similar services
are covered under this subdivision.
    (e) The commissioner shall develop and implement package rates, bundled rates, or per diem
rates for special education services under which separately covered services are grouped together
and billed as a unit in order to reduce administrative complexity.
    (f) The commissioner shall develop a cost-based payment structure for payment of these services.
The commissioner shall reimburse claims submitted based on an interim rate, and shall settle at a
final rate once the department has determined it. The commissioner shall notify the school district
of the final rate. The school district has 60 days to appeal the final rate. To appeal the final rate, the
school district shall file a written appeal request to the commissioner within 60 days of the date the
final rate determination was mailed. The appeal request shall specify (1) the disputed items and (2)
the name and address of the person to contact regarding the appeal.
    (g) Effective July 1, 2000, medical assistance services provided under an individual education
plan or an individual family service plan by local school districts shall not count against medical
assistance authorization thresholds for that child.
    (h) Nursing services as defined in section 148.171, subdivision 15, and provided as an
individual education plan health-related service, are eligible for medical assistance payment if they
are otherwise a covered service under the medical assistance program. Medical assistance covers
the administration of prescription medications by a licensed nurse who is employed by or under
contract with a school district when the administration of medications is identified in the child's
individualized education plan. The simple administration of medications alone is not covered under
medical assistance when administered by a provider other than a school district or when it is not
identified in the child's individualized education plan.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

couples, either or both of whom participate in the medical assistance program, use their own assets to
pay their share of the total cost of their care during or after their enrollment in the program according
to applicable federal law and the laws of this state. The following provisions apply:
   (1) subdivisions 1c to 1k shall not apply to claims arising under this section which are presented
under section 525.313;
    (2) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k expanding the interests included in an estate for
purposes of recovery under this section give effect to the provisions of United States Code, title 42,
section 1396p, governing recoveries, but do not give rise to any express or implied liens in favor of
any other parties not named in these provisions;
    (3) the continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property after
the recipient's death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance under this section modifies
common law principles holding that these interests terminate on the death of the holder;
   (4) all laws, rules, and regulations governing or involved with a recovery of medical assistance
shall be liberally construed to accomplish their intended purposes;
    (5) a deceased recipient's life estate and joint tenancy interests continued under this section shall
be owned by the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear on the date
of the recipient's death. They shall not be merged into the remainder interest or the interests of the
surviving joint tenants by reason of ownership. They shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
Any conveyance, transfer, sale, assignment, or encumbrance by a remainderman, a surviving joint
tenant, or their heirs, successors, and assigns shall be deemed to include all of their interest in the
deceased recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest continued under this section; and
    (6) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k continuing a recipient's joint tenancy interests in
real property after the recipient's death do not apply to a homestead owned of record, on the date the
recipient dies, by the recipient and the recipient's spouse as joint tenants with a right of survivorship.
Homestead means the real property occupied by the surviving joint tenant spouse as their sole
residence on the date the recipient dies and classified and taxed to the recipient and surviving joint
tenant spouse as homestead property for property tax purposes in the calendar year in which the
recipient dies. For purposes of this exemption, real property the recipient and their surviving joint
tenant spouse purchase solely with the proceeds from the sale of their prior homestead, own of
record as joint tenants, and qualify as homestead property under section 273.124 in the calendar
year in which the recipient dies and prior to the recipient's death shall be deemed to be real property
classified and taxed to the recipient and their surviving joint tenant spouse as homestead property
in the calendar year in which the recipient dies. The surviving spouse, or any person with personal
knowledge of the facts, may provide an affidavit describing the homestead property affected by
this clause and stating facts showing compliance with this clause. The affidavit shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts it states.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "medical assistance" includes the medical assistance program
under this chapter and the general assistance medical care program under chapter 256D and
alternative care for nonmedical assistance recipients under section 256B.0913.
  (c) For purposes of this section, beginning January 1, 2010, "medical assistance" does not include
Medicare cost-sharing benefits in accordance with United States Code, title 42, section 1396p.

    (d) All provisions in this subdivision, and subdivisions 1d, 1f, 1g, 1h, 1i, and 1j, related to the
continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property after the recipient's
death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance, are effective only for life estates and joint
tenancy interests established on or after August 1, 2003. For purposes of this paragraph, medical
assistance does not include alternative care.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Estates subject to claims. (a) If a person receives any medical assistance hereunder,
on the person's death, if single, or on the death of the survivor of a married couple, either or both

paid for medical assistance rendered for the person and spouse shall be filed as a claim against the
estate of the person or the estate of the surviving spouse in the court having jurisdiction to probate
the estate or to issue a decree of descent according to sections 525.31 to 525.313.
   (b) For the purposes of this section, the person's estate must consist of:
   (1) the person's probate estate;
    (2) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in real property the person owned
as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with a right of survivorship at the time of the person's death;
    (3) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in securities the person owned
in beneficiary form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's
death, to the extent the interests or proceeds of those interests become part of the probate estate
under section 524.6-307;
   (4) all of the person's interests in joint accounts, multiple-party accounts, and pay-on-death
accounts, brokerage accounts, investment accounts, or the proceeds of those accounts, as provided
under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death to the extent the interests
become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and
    (5) assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the person through survivorship, living trust,
or other arrangements.
    (c) For the purpose of this section and recovery in a surviving spouse's estate for medical
assistance paid for a predeceased spouse, the estate must consist of all of the legal title and interests
the deceased individual's predeceased spouse had in jointly owned or marital property at the time
of the spouse's death, as defined in subdivision 2b, and the proceeds of those interests, that passed
to the deceased individual or another individual, a survivor, an heir, or an assign of the predeceased
spouse through a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other
arrangement. A deceased recipient who, at death, owned the property jointly with the surviving
spouse shall have an interest in the entire property.
    (d) For the purpose of recovery in a single person's estate or the estate of a survivor of a married
couple, "other arrangement" includes any other means by which title to all or any part of the jointly
owned or marital property or interest passed from the predeceased spouse to another including, but
not limited to, transfers between spouses which are permitted, prohibited, or penalized for purposes
of medical assistance.

         ) (3) the person received general assistance medical care services under chapter 256D.
    (f) The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent for the purpose of
section 524.3-805. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency with a
claim under this section must be a creditor under section 524.6-307. Any statute of limitations that
purports to limit any county agency or the state agency, or both, to recover for medical assistance
granted hereunder shall not apply to any claim made hereunder for reimbursement for any medical
assistance granted hereunder. Notice of the claim shall be given to all heirs and devisees of the
decedent whose identity can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The notice must include
procedures and instructions for making an application for a hardship waiver under subdivision 5;
time frames for submitting an application and determination; and information regarding appeal
rights and procedures. Counties are entitled to one-half of the nonfederal share of medical assistance
collections from estates that are directly attributable to county effort. Counties are entitled to ten
percent of the collections for alternative care directly attributable to county effort.

property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate
as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who
was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy

conveyance, or any disposition of real property allocable to the decedent's life estate or joint
tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash
the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal
representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to,
ordering a partition of real estate under chapter 558 necessary to make the value of the decedent's
life estate or joint tenancy interest available to the estate for payment of a claim under this section.

decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the
estate has other assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement
under paragraph ­  (h

recorder or filed in the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is
located. Except as provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit
shall terminate the decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint
tenant with others. The affidavit shall:
    (1) be signed by the personal representative;
    (2) identify the decedent and the interest being terminated;
    (3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that created the interest in
real property being terminated;

decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section;

or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant and the
other owners or remaindermen or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed under this
subdivision; and
   (7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest under this subdivision,
and any other contents as may be appropriate.
The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall
be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording
information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall
be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.

the estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen
or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work
a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder
interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the
property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.

of the surviving spouse's estate under subdivisions 1a and 2b. Recovery of medical assistance
expenses in the nonrecipient surviving spouse's estate is limited to the value of the assets of the
estate that were marital property or jointly owned property at any time during the marriage. The
claim is not payable from the value of assets or proceeds of assets in the estate attributable to
a predeceased spouse whom the individual married after the death of the predeceased recipient
spouse for whom the claim is filed or from assets and the proceeds of assets in the estate which
the nonrecipient decedent spouse acquired with assets which were not marital property or jointly
owned property after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse. Claims for alternative care
shall be net of all premiums paid under section 256B.0913, subdivision 12, on or after July 1, 2003,
and shall be limited to services provided on or after July 1, 2003. Claims against marital property
shall be limited to claims against recipients who died on or after July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Controlling provisions. (a) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 1a and
2, paragraphs (b) to (d) apply.
    (b) At the time of death of a recipient spouse and solely for purpose of recovery of medical
assistance benefits received, a predeceased recipient spouse shall have a legal title or interest in
the undivided whole of all of the property which the recipient and the recipient's surviving spouse
owned jointly or which was marital property at any time during their marriage regardless of the
form of ownership and regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both
the recipient and the recipient's spouse. Title and interest in the property of a predeceased recipient
spouse shall not end or extinguish upon the person's death and shall continue for the purpose of
allowing recovery of medical assistance in the estate of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the
predeceased recipient spouse, title and interest in the predeceased spouse's property shall vest in the
surviving spouse by operation of law and without the necessity for any probate or decree of descent
proceedings and shall continue to exist after the death of the predeceased spouse and the surviving
spouse to permit recovery of medical assistance. The recipient spouse and the surviving spouse of a
deceased recipient spouse shall not encumber, disclaim, transfer, alienate, hypothecate, or otherwise
divest themselves of these interests before or upon death.
    (c) For purposes of this section, "marital property" includes any and all real or personal property
of any kind or interests in such property the predeceased recipient spouse and their spouse, or
either of them, owned at the time of their marriage to each other or acquired during their marriage
regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both of them. If either or both
spouses of a married couple received medical assistance, all property owned during the marriage or
which either or both spouses acquired during their marriage shall be presumed to be marital property
for purposes of recovering medical assistance unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the
contrary.
    (d) The agency responsible for the claim for medical assistance for a recipient spouse may, at
its discretion, release specific real and personal property from the provisions of this section. The
release shall extinguish the interest created under paragraph (b) in the land it describes upon filing
or recording. The release need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of filing
or recording and shall be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles,
as appropriate, in the county where the real property is located. The party to whom the release is
given shall be responsible for paying all fees and costs necessary to record and file the release. If
the property described in the release is registered property, the registrar of titles shall accept it for

recording and shall record it on the certificate of title for each parcel of property described in the
release. If the property described in the release is abstract property, the recorder shall accept it for
filing and file it in the county's grantor-grantee indexes and any tract index the county maintains for
each parcel of property described in the release.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Commissioner's intervention. The commissioner shall be permitted to intervene as a
party in any proceeding involving recovery of medical assistance upon filing a notice of intervention
and serving such notice on the other parties.
   Sec. 44. [256B.196] INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS; HOSPITAL PAYMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Federal approval required. This section is contingent on federal approval of
the intergovernmental transfers and payments authorized under this section. This section is also
contingent on current payment by the government entities of the intergovernmental transfers under
this section.
    Subd. 2. Commissioner's duties. (a) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3,
the commissioner shall determine the fee-for-service outpatient hospital services upper payment
limit for nonstate government hospitals. The commissioner shall then determine the amount of
a supplemental payment to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital for these
services that would increase medical assistance spending in this category to the aggregate upper
payment limit for all nonstate government hospitals in Minnesota. In making this determination,
the commissioner shall allot the available increases between Hennepin County Medical Center
and Regions Hospital based on the ratio of medical assistance fee-for-service outpatient hospital
payments to the two facilities. The commissioner shall adjust this allotment as necessary based on
federal approvals, the amount of intergovernmental transfers received from Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties, and other factors, in order to maximize the additional total payments. The commissioner
shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic intergovernmental transfers
necessary to match federal Medicaid payments available under this subdivision in order to make
supplementary medical assistance payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions
Hospital equal to an amount that when combined with existing medical assistance payments
to nonstate governmental hospitals would increase total payments to hospitals in this category
for outpatient services to the aggregate upper payment limit for all hospitals in this category in
Minnesota. Upon receipt of these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary
payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3, the commissioner shall determine
an upper payment limit for physicians affiliated with Hennepin County Medical Center and
with Regions Hospital. The upper payment limit shall be based on the average commercial rate
or be determined using another method acceptable to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic
intergovernmental transfers necessary to match the federal Medicaid payments available under
this subdivision in order to make supplementary payments to physicians affiliated with Hennepin
County Medical Center and Regions Hospital equal to the difference between the established
medical assistance payment for physician services and the upper payment limit. Upon receipt of
these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary payments to physicians of
Hennepin Faculty Associates and HealthPartners.

    (c) Beginning January 1, 2010, Hennepin County and Ramsey County shall make monthly
intergovernmental transfers to the commissioner in the following amounts: $133,333 by Hennepin
County and $100,000 by Ramsey County. The commissioner shall increase the medical assistance
capitation payments to Metropolitan Health Plan and HealthPartners by an amount equal to the
annual value of the monthly transfers plus federal financial participation.
    (d) The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County on an ongoing basis of
the need for any changes needed in the intergovernmental transfers in order to continue the payments
under paragraphs (a) to (c), at their maximum level, including increases in upper payment limits,
changes in the federal Medicaid match, and other factors.
   (e) The payments in paragraphs (a) to (c) shall be implemented independently of each other,
subject to federal approval and to the receipt of transfers under subdivision 3.
    Subd. 3. Intergovernmental transfers. Based on the determination by the commissioner
under subdivision 2, Hennepin County and Ramsey County shall make periodic intergovernmental
transfers to the commissioner for the purposes of subdivision 2, paragraphs (a) to (c). All of the
intergovernmental transfers made by Hennepin County shall be used to match federal payments to
Hennepin County Medical Center under subdivision 2, paragraph (a); to physicians affiliated with
Hennepin Faculty Associates under subdivision 2, paragraph (b); and to Metropolitan Health Plan
under subdivision 2, paragraph (c). All of the intergovernmental transfers made by Ramsey County
shall be used to match federal payments to Regions Hospital under subdivision 2, paragraph (a); to
physicians affiliated with HealthPartners under subdivision 2, paragraph (b); and to HealthPartners
under subdivision 2, paragraph (c).
    Subd. 4. Adjustments permitted. (a) The commissioner may adjust the intergovernmental
transfers under subdivision 3 and the payments under subdivision 2, based on the commissioner's
determination of Medicare upper payment limits, hospital-specific charge limits, hospital-specific
limitations on disproportionate share payments, medical inflation, actuarial certification, and
cost-effectiveness for purposes of federal waivers. Any adjustments must be made on a proportional
basis. The commissioner may make adjustments under this subdivision only after consultation with
the affected counties and hospitals. All payments under subdivision 2 and all intergovernmental
transfers under subdivision 3 are limited to amounts available after all other base rates, adjustments,
and supplemental payments in chapter 256B are calculated.
    (b) The ratio of medical assistance payments specified in subdivision 2 to the voluntary
intergovernmental transfers specified in subdivision 3 shall not be reduced except as provided
under paragraph (a).
    Subd. 5. Recession period. Each type of intergovernmental transfer in subdivision 2, paragraphs
(a) to (d), for payment periods from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, is voluntary on
the part of Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, meaning that the transfer must be agreed to, in writing,
by the counties prior to any payments being issued. One agreement on each type of transfer shall
cover the entire recession period.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.199, is amended to read:

are appropriated to the commissioner for the payments under section 256.969, subdivision 27; and
    (3) by May 1 of each year, beginning May 1, 2007, the commissioner shall inform the nonstate
entities listed in paragraph (a) of the amount of federal disproportionate share hospital payment
money expected to be available in the current federal fiscal year.
   (c) The commissioner shall apply for federal matching funds for general assistance medical care
expenditures as follows:
   (1) for hospital services occurring on or after July 1, 2007, general assistance medical care
expenditures for fee-for-service inpatient and outpatient hospital payments made by the department
shall be used to apply for federal matching funds, except as limited below:
   (i) only those general assistance medical care expenditures made to an individual hospital that
would not cause the hospital to exceed its individual hospital limits under section 1923 of the Social
Security Act may be considered; and
   (ii) general assistance medical care expenditures may be considered only to the extent of
Minnesota's aggregate allotment under section 1923 of the Social Security Act; and
    (2) all hospitals must provide any necessary expenditure, cost, and revenue information required
by the commissioner as necessary for purposes of obtaining federal Medicaid matching funds for
general assistance medical care expenditures.
    (d) For the period from April 1, 2009, to September 30, 2010, the commissioner shall apply
for additional federal matching funds available as disproportionate share hospital payments under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These funds shall be made available as
the state share of payments under section 256.969, subdivision 28. The entities required to report
certified public expenditures under paragraph (b), clause (1), shall report additional certified public
expenditures as necessary under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and sections
256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
51ST DAY]                                     MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                                        4699

    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
     (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing
plan's payment rate under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance and general
assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each performance
target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case
of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each
performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across
a broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement
of plan efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The
commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting
only one plan, including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must
be returned no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23.

      Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5c. Medical education and research fund. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), the
commissioner of human services shall transfer each year to the medical education and research fund
established under section 62J.692, the following:
    (1) an amount equal to the reduction in the prepaid medical assistance and prepaid general
assistance medical care payments as specified in this clause. Until January 1, 2002, the county
medical assistance and general assistance medical care capitation base rate prior to plan specific
adjustments and after the regional rate adjustments under section 256B.69, subdivision 5b, is
reduced 6.3 percent for Hennepin County, two percent for the remaining metropolitan counties,
and no reduction for nonmetropolitan Minnesota counties; and after January 1, 2002, the
county medical assistance and general assistance medical care capitation base rate prior to plan
specific adjustments is reduced 6.3 percent for Hennepin County, two percent for the remaining
metropolitan counties, and 1.6 percent for nonmetropolitan Minnesota counties. Nursing facility
and elderly waiver payments and demonstration project payments operating under subdivision 23
are excluded from this reduction. The amount calculated under this clause shall not be adjusted for
periods already paid due to subsequent changes to the capitation payments;

    (b) This subdivision shall be effective upon approval of a federal waiver which allows federal
financial participation in the medical education and research fund. Effective July 1, 2009, and
thereafter, the transfers required by paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (4), shall not exceed the total

   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5f, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5f. Capitation rates. (a) Beginning July 1, 2002, the capitation rates paid under this
section are increased by $12,700,000 per year. Beginning July 1, 2003, the capitation rates paid

    (b) Beginning July 1, 2009, the capitation rates paid under this section are increased each year
by the lesser of $21,714,000 or an amount equal to the difference between the estimated value of
the reductions described in subdivision 5c, paragraph (a), clause (1), and the amount of the limit
described in subdivision 5c, paragraph (b).
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
4702                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [51ST DAY

to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
51ST DAY]                          MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                       4703

to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods for contract
years starting in 2012, the commissioner must consider the methods used to determine county
allocations for home and community-based program participants. If necessary to reduce MnDHO
rates to comply with the provision regarding MnDHO costs for home and community-based
services, the commissioner shall achieve the reduction by maintaining the base rate for contract
years 2010 and 2011 for services provided under the community alternatives for disabled
individuals waiver at the same level as for contract year 2009. The commissioner may apply other
reductions to MnDHO rates to implement decreases in provider payment rates required by state
law. In developing program specifications for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner
shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph
(d), including consultation on whether and how to include home and community-based waiver
programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the
house of representatives and senate committees with jurisdiction over health and human services
policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.

without complicating diagnosis, shall be calculated as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) The commissioner shall calculate a single rate for all of the diagnostic related groups specified
in paragraph (a) consistent with an increase in the proportion of births by vaginal delivery and a
reduction in the percentage of births by cesarean section. The calculated single rate must be based
on an expected increase in the number of vaginal births and expected reduction in the number of
cesarean section such that the reduction in cesarean sections is less than or equal to one standard
deviation below the average in the frequency of cesarean births for Minnesota health care program
clients at hospitals performing greater than 50 deliveries per year.
   (c) The rates described in this subdivision do not include newborn care.
    Subd. 2. Provider rate. Notwithstanding section 256B.76, effective for services provided on

subdivision 1, paragraph (a), shall be calculated using the methodology specified in subdivision 1,
paragraph (b).
    Subd. 3. Health plans. Payments to managed care and county-based purchasing plans under
sections 256B.69, 256B.692, or 256L.12 shall be reduced for services provided on or after October

established patient," "delivery, antepartum, and postpartum care," "critical care," cesarean delivery
and pharmacologic management provided to psychiatric patients, and level three codes for enhanced
services for prenatal high risk, shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 25 percent
above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992. If the rate on any procedure code within these categories
is different than the rate that would have been paid under the methodology in section 256B.74,
subdivision 2, then the larger rate shall be paid;
   (2) payments for all other services shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 15.4
percent above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992; and
    (3) all physician rates shall be converted from the 50th percentile of 1982 to the 50th percentile

rates for home health agency services shall be the rates in effect on September 30, 1992.

or individual must not have access to subsidized health coverage through an employer and must not
have had access to employer-subsidized coverage through a current employer for 18 months prior
to application or reapplication. A family or individual whose employer-subsidized coverage is lost
due to an employer terminating health care coverage as an employee benefit during the previous 18
months is not eligible.
    (b) This subdivision does not apply to a family or individual who was enrolled in MinnesotaCare
within six months or less of reapplication and who no longer has employer-subsidized coverage due
to the employer terminating health care coverage as an employee benefit. This subdivision does not
apply to children with family gross incomes that are equal to or less than 200 percent of federal
poverty guidelines.
    (c) For purposes of this requirement, subsidized health coverage means health coverage for
which the employer pays at least 50 percent of the cost of coverage for the employee or dependent, or
a higher percentage as specified by the commissioner. Children are eligible for employer-subsidized
coverage through either parent, including the noncustodial parent. The commissioner must treat
employer contributions to Internal Revenue Code Section 125 plans and any other employer benefits
intended to pay health care costs as qualified employer subsidies toward the cost of health coverage
for employees for purposes of this subdivision.

within one month of application must meet the provisions of this subdivision and subdivision 2.
    (e) Cost-effective health insurance that was paid for by medical assistance is not considered

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009, or upon federal approval, whichever
is later.
   Sec. 66. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Automatic eligibility for certain children. Any child who was residing in foster care
or a juvenile residential correctional facility on the child's 18th birthday is automatically deemed
eligible for MinnesotaCare upon termination or release until the child reaches the age of 21, and is
exempt from the requirements of this section and section 256L.15. To be enrolled under this section,
a child must complete an initial application for MinnesotaCare. The commissioner shall contact
individuals enrolled under this section annually to ensure the individual continues to reside in the
state and is interested in continuing MinnesotaCare coverage.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009, or upon federal approval, whichever
is later.
   Sec. 67. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Medical assistance rate to be used. (a) Payment to providers under sections
256L.01 to 256L.11 shall be at the same rates and conditions established for medical assistance,
except as provided in subdivisions 2 to 6.
    (b) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2009, total payments for basic care services
shall be reduced by three percent, in accordance with section 256B.766. Payments made to managed
care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after October 1, 2009, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 68. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
4716                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [51ST DAY

the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. Until June 30, 2009, the sliding fee scale begins with a
premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families
with incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in
effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1,
1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family
size of five. The sliding fee scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five.
The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.
    (b) Children in families whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge
for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum
premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and
administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of
the total. The costs of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and
the enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two
enrollees shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or
more enrollees shall be three times the maximum premium for one.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2009, MinnesotaCare enrollees shall pay premiums according to the
premium scale specified in paragraph (d) with the exception that children in families with income

at or below 1­0­ 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines shall pay ­

4720                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [51ST DAY

by the commissioner of finance may be
transferred from one project to another
and from development to operations as the
commissioner of human services considers
necessary. Any unexpended balance in

program grants or nongrant administration.
All additional funding is appropriated to the

and any other applicable federal requirement
or limitation. Prior to any expenditure of these

funds are expended in compliance with the
requirements and limitations of federal law
and that any reporting requirements of federal
law are met. It shall be the responsibility
51ST DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009   4721

of any entity to which these funds are

of understanding with the commissioner
that provides the necessary assurance of
compliance prior to any expenditure of funds.

appropriated to any state, local, or nonprofit
entity cancel at the end of the state fiscal
year unless appropriating language permits
otherwise.
TANF Funds Transferred to Other Federal
Grants. The commissioner must authorize
transfers from TANF to other federal block
grants so that funds are available to meet the
annual expenditure needs as appropriated.
Transfers may be authorized prior to the
expenditure year with the agreement of the
receiving entity. Transferred funds must be
expended in the year for which the funds were
appropriated unless appropriation language
permits otherwise. In accelerating transfer
authorizations, the commissioner must aim to
preserve the future potential transfer capacity
from TANF to other block grants.

Regulations, title 45, section 263.1.
(e) If nonfederal expenditures for the
programs and purposes listed in paragraph

legislature, if the legislature is or will be in
session to take action to specify additional
sources of nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE before a federal penalty is
imposed. The commissioner shall otherwise
provide notice to the legislative commission
on planning and fiscal policy under paragraph
(g).
(f) If the commissioner uses authority
granted under section 11, or similar authority
granted by a subsequent legislature, to meet
the state's TANF/MOE requirement in a
reporting period, the commissioner shall
inform the chairs of the appropriate legislative

that authority for this purpose.
(g) If the commissioner determines that
nonfederal expenditures under paragraph
(a) are insufficient to meet TANF/MOE
expenditure requirements, and if the
legislature is not or will not be in session
to take timely action to avoid a federal
penalty, the commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures from other allowable
sources as TANF/MOE expenditures

are met. The commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures in addition to those
specified under paragraph (a) as nonfederal
TANF/MOE expenditures, but only ten
days after the commissioner of finance

expenditures to the members of the legislative
commission on planning and fiscal policy for
their review.
(h) The commissioner of finance shall not
incorporate any changes in federal TANF
expenditures or nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE that may result from reporting
additional allowable sources of nonfederal
TANF/MOE expenditures under the interim
procedures in paragraph (g) into the February
or November forecasts required under
Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.103, unless
the commissioner of finance has approved
the additional sources of expenditures under
paragraph (g).
(i) Minnesota Statutes, section 256.011,
subdivision 3, which requires that federal
grants or aids secured or obtained under that
subdivision be used to reduce any direct
appropriations provided by law, do not apply
if the grants or aids are federal TANF funds.

various disabilities and diagnoses and ages. At least 51 percent of the members of the advisory group
must be recipients of personal care.
    The commissioner of human services may contract with the commissioner of health to enforce
the jointly promulgated licensure rules for personal care service providers.
    Prior to final promulgation of the joint rule the commissioner of human services shall report
preliminary findings along with any comments of the advisory group and a plan for monitoring and
enforcement by the Department of Health to the legislature by February 15, 1992.
   Limits on the extent of personal care services that may be provided to an individual must be
based on the cost-effectiveness of the services in relation to the costs of inpatient hospital care,
nursing home care, and other available types of care. The rules must provide, at a minimum:
    (1) that agencies be selected to contract with or employ and train staff to provide and supervise
the provision of personal care services;
    (2) that agencies employ or contract with a qualified applicant that a qualified recipient proposes
to the agency as the recipient's choice of assistant;
    (3) that agencies bill the medical assistance program for a personal care service by a personal care
assistant and supervision by a qualified professional supervising the personal care assistant unless
the recipient selects the fiscal agent option under section ­  2­56

through an agency in a particular county, when there are less than two agencies providing services
in that county and shall waive the requirement for personal care assistants required to join an agency
for the first time during 1993 when personal care services are provided under a relative hardship
waiver under Minnesota Statutes 1992, section 256B.0627, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (7),
and at least two agencies providing personal care services have refused to employ or contract with
the independent personal care assistant.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.055, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Disabled children. (a) A person is eligible for medical assistance if the person is under
age 19 and qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section 1382c(a), and
would be eligible for medical assistance under the state plan if residing in a medical institution, and
the child requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities, for whom home care is appropriate, provided that the
cost to medical assistance under this section is not more than the amount that medical assistance
would pay for if the child resides in an institution. After the child is determined to be eligible under
this section, the commissioner shall review the child's disability under United States Code, title
42, section 1382c(a) and level of care defined under this section no more often than annually and
may elect, based on the recommendation of health care professionals under contract with the state
medical review team, to extend the review of disability and level of care up to a maximum of four
years. The commissioner's decision on the frequency of continuing review of disability and level of

care is not subject to administrative appeal under section 256.045. The county agency shall send a
notice of disability review to the enrollee six months prior to the date the recertification of disability
is due. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting other redeterminations of medical
assistance eligibility under this chapter and annual cost-effective reviews under this section.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means an institution as defined in section
144.696, subdivision 3, 144.55, subdivision 3, or Minnesota Rules, part 4640.3600, and licensed
pursuant to sections 144.50 to 144.58. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of
care provided in a hospital if the child is determined by the commissioner to need an extensive
array of health services, including mental health services, for an undetermined period of time,
whose health condition requires frequent monitoring and treatment by a health care professional
or by a person supervised by a health care professional, who would reside in a hospital or require
frequent hospitalization if these services were not provided, and the daily care needs are more
complex than a nursing facility level of care.
    A child with serious emotional disturbance requires a level of care provided in a hospital if
the commissioner determines that the individual requires 24-hour supervision because the person
exhibits recurrent or frequent suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, recurrent or frequent
psychosomatic disorders or somatopsychic disorders that may become life threatening, recurrent or
frequent severe socially unacceptable behavior associated with psychiatric disorder, ongoing and
chronic psychosis or severe, ongoing and chronic developmental problems requiring continuous
skilled observation, or severe disabling symptoms for which office-centered outpatient treatment is
not adequate, and which overall severely impact the individual's ability to function.
     (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "nursing facility" means a facility which provides nursing
care as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, licensed pursuant to sections 144A.02 to 144A.10,
which is appropriate if a person is in active restorative treatment; is in need of special treatments
provided or supervised by a licensed nurse; or has unpredictable episodes of active disease processes
requiring immediate judgment by a licensed nurse. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires
the level of care provided in a nursing facility if the child is determined by the commissioner to meet
the requirements of the preadmission screening assessment document under section 256B.0911 ­                                 an­d

    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities" or "ICF/MR" means a program licensed to provide services to persons with
developmental disabilities under section 252.28, and chapter 245A, and a physical plant licensed
as a supervised living facility under chapter 144, which together are certified by the Minnesota
Department of Health as meeting the standards in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part
483, for an intermediate care facility which provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities who require 24-hour supervision and active treatment for medical, behavioral, or
habilitation needs. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of care provided in an
ICF/MR if the commissioner finds that the child has a developmental disability in accordance with
section 256B.092, is in need of a 24-hour plan of care and active treatment similar to persons with
developmental disabilities, and there is a reasonable indication that the child will need ICF/MR
services.
     (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a person requires the level of care provided in a nursing

facility if the person requires 24-hour monitoring or supervision and a plan of mental health
treatment because of specific symptoms or functional impairments associated with a serious mental
illness or disorder diagnosis, which meet severity criteria for mental health established by the
commissioner and published in March 1997 as the Minnesota Mental Health Level of Care for
Children and Adolescents with Severe Emotional Disorders.
    (f) The determination of the level of care needed by the child shall be made by the commissioner
based on information supplied to the commissioner by the parent or guardian, the child's physician
or physicians, and other professionals as requested by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
establish a screening team to conduct the level of care determinations according to this subdivision.
    (g) If a child meets the conditions in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e), the commissioner must assess
the case to determine whether:
   (1) the child qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section
1382c(a), and would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a medical institution; and
    (2) the cost of medical assistance services for the child, if eligible under this subdivision, would
not be more than the cost to medical assistance if the child resides in a medical institution to be
determined as follows:
    (i) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the cost of care for the child
in an institution shall be determined using the average payment rate established for the regional
treatment centers that are certified as ICF's/MR;
    (ii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an inpatient hospital setting according to
paragraph (b), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3520,
items F and G; and
    (iii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in a nursing facility according to paragraph
(c) or (e), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3040,
except that the nursing facility average rate shall be adjusted to reflect rates which would be paid
for children under age 16. The commissioner may authorize an amount up to the amount medical
assistance would pay for a child referred to the commissioner by the preadmission screening team
under section 256B.0911.
    (h) Children eligible for medical assistance services under section 256B.055, subdivision 12, as
of June 30, 1995, must be screened according to the criteria in this subdivision prior to January 1,
1996. Children found to be ineligible may not be removed from the program until January 1, 1996.

   (ii) the limits and conditions which apply to federal Medicaid funding for this service; and
   (5) "targeted case management" means case management services provided to help recipients

    Subd. 17. Cost of services and supports. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that the average
per capita expenditures estimated in any fiscal year for home and community-based waiver
recipients does not exceed the average per capita expenditures that would have been made to
provide institutional services for recipients in the absence of the waiver.
    (b) The commissioner shall implement on January 1, 2002, one or more aggregate, need-based
methods for allocating to local agencies the home and community-based waivered service resources
available to support recipients with disabilities in need of the level of care provided in a nursing
facility or a hospital. The commissioner shall allocate resources to single counties and county
partnerships in a manner that reflects consideration of:
   (1) an incentive-based payment process for achieving outcomes;
   (2) the need for a state-level risk pool;
   (3) the need for retention of management responsibility at the state agency level; and
   (4) a phase-in strategy as appropriate.
    (c) Until the allocation methods described in paragraph (b) are implemented, the annual
allowable reimbursement level of home and community-based waiver services shall be the greater
of:
    (1) the statewide average payment amount which the recipient is assigned under the waiver
reimbursement system in place on June 30, 2001, modified by the percentage of any provider rate
increase appropriated for home and community-based services; or
    (2) an amount approved by the commissioner based on the recipient's extraordinary needs that
cannot be met within the current allowable reimbursement level. The increased reimbursement level
must be necessary to allow the recipient to be discharged from an institution or to prevent imminent
placement in an institution. The additional reimbursement may be used to secure environmental
modifications; assistive technology and equipment; and increased costs for supervision, training,
and support services necessary to address the recipient's extraordinary needs. The commissioner
may approve an increased reimbursement level for up to one year of the recipient's relocation from
an institution or up to six months of a determination that a current waiver recipient is at imminent
risk of being placed in an institution.

representative receives the resident classification notice. The request for reconsideration must
include the name of the resident, the name and address of the facility in which the resident resides,
the reasons for the reconsideration, the requested classification changes, and documentation
supporting the requested classification. The documentation accompanying the reconsideration
request is limited to documentation which establishes that the needs of the resident at the time of

commissioner of health.
    (b) Upon request, the nursing facility must give the resident or the resident's representative a
copy of the assessment form and the other documentation that was given to the commissioner of
health to support the assessment findings. The nursing facility shall also provide access to and a copy
of other information from the resident's record that has been requested by or on behalf of the resident
to support a resident's reconsideration request. A copy of any requested material must be provided

provide the material within this time, it is subject to the issuance of a correction order and penalty
assessment under sections 144.653 and 144A.10. Notwithstanding those sections, any correction
order issued under this subdivision must require that the nursing facility immediately comply with
the request for information and that as of the date of the issuance of the correction order, the facility
shall forfeit to the state a $100 fine for the first day of noncompliance, and an increase in the $100
fine by $50 increments for each day the noncompliance continues.
    (c) In addition to the information required under paragraphs (a) and (b), a reconsideration request
from a nursing facility must contain the following information: (i) the date the reimbursement
classification notices were received by the facility; (ii) the date the classification notices were
distributed to the resident or the resident's representative; and (iii) a copy of a notice sent to the
resident or to the resident's representative. This notice must inform the resident or the resident's
representative that a reconsideration of the resident's classification is being requested, the reason

facility fails to provide the required information with the reconsideration request, the request
must be denied, and the facility may not make further reconsideration requests on that specific
reimbursement classification.
    (d) Reconsideration by the commissioner must be made by individuals not involved in
reviewing the assessment, audit, or reconsideration that established the disputed classification. The

home shall be notified within five working days after the decision is made. A decision by the
commissioner under this subdivision is the final administrative decision of the agency for the party
requesting reconsideration.

that applies to the resident while the request for reconsideration is pending. If a request for
reconsideration applies to an assessment used to determine nursing facility level of care under

    (c) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the moratorium established in
paragraph (a), that are in the process of receiving an adult or child foster care license as of July 1,
2009, shall be allowed to continue to complete the process of receiving an adult or child foster care
license. For this paragraph, all of the following conditions must be met to be considered in process
of receiving an adult or child foster care license:
   (1) participants have made decisions to move into the residential setting, including
documentation in each participant's care plan;
   (2) the provider has purchased housing or has made a financial investment in the property;
    (3) the lead agency has approved the plans, including costs for the residential setting for each
individual;
   (4) the completion of the licensing process, including all necessary inspections, is the only
remaining component prior to being able to provide services; and
   (5) the needs of the individuals cannot be met within the existing capacity in that county.
To qualify for the process under this paragraph, the lead agency must submit documentation to the
commissioner by August 1, 2009, that all of the above criteria are met.
   (d) The commissioner shall study the effects of the license moratorium under this subdivision
and shall report back to the legislature by January 15, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Community residential setting license. (a) The commissioner shall establish provider
standards for residential support services that integrate service standards and the residential setting
under one license. The commissioner shall propose statutory language and an implementation plan
for licensing requirements for residential support services to the legislature by January 15, 2011.
    (b) Providers licensed under chapter 245B, and providing, contracting, or arranging for services
in settings licensed as adult foster care under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, or
child foster care under Minnesota Rules, parts 2960.3000 to 2960.3340; and meeting the provisions
of section 256B.092, subdivision 11, paragraph (b), must be required to obtain a community
residential setting license.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 252.46, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Day training and habilitation rates. The commissioner shall establish a statewide
rate-setting methodology for all day training and habilitation services. The rate-setting methodology
must abide by the principles of transparency and equitability across the state. The methodology
must involve a uniform process of structuring rates for each service and must promote quality and
participant choice.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 252.50, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Community-based programs established. The commissioner shall establish a
system of state-operated, community-based programs for persons with developmental disabilities.
For purposes of this section, "state-operated, community-based program" means a program
administered by the state to provide treatment and habilitation in noninstitutional community
settings to persons with developmental disabilities. Employees of the programs, except clients
who work within and benefit from these treatment and habilitation programs, must be state
employees under chapters 43A and 179A. Although any clients who work within and benefit
from these treatment and habilitation programs are not employees under chapters 43A and
179A, the Department of Human Services may consider clients who work within and benefit
from these programs employees for federal tax purposes. The establishment of state-operated,
community-based programs must be within the context of a comprehensive definition of the role
of state-operated services in the state. The role of state-operated services must be defined within
the context of a comprehensive system of services for persons with developmental disabilities.
State-operated, community-based programs may include, but are not limited to, community
group homes, foster care, supportive living services, day training and habilitation programs, and
respite care arrangements. The commissioner may operate the pilot projects established under
Laws 1985, First Special Session chapter 9, article 1, section 2, subdivision 6, and shall, within
the limits of available appropriations, establish additional state-operated, community-based
programs for persons with developmental disabilities. State-operated, community-based programs
may accept admissions from regional treatment centers, from the person's own home, or from
community programs. State-operated, community-based programs offering day program services
may be provided for persons with developmental disabilities who are living in state-operated,
community-based residential programs until July 1, 2000. No later than 1994, the commissioner,
together with family members, counties, advocates, employee representatives, and other interested
parties, shall begin planning so that by July 1, 2000, state-operated, community-based residential
facilities will be in compliance with section 252.41, subdivision 9.

Administration.
    (b) Prior to a denial or withdrawal of a requested determination of disability due to insufficient

over health and human services finance and budget the following information on the activities of
the state medical review team by February 1, 2010, and annually thereafter:
   (1) the number of applications to the state medical review team that were denied, approved, or
withdrawn;
   (2) the average length of time from receipt of the application to a decision;
   (3) the number of appeals and appeal results;
   (4) for applicants, their age, health coverage at the time of application, hospitalization history

   Sec. 13. [256.0281] INTERAGENCY DATA EXCHANGE.
    The Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, and the Office of the
Ombudsman for Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities may establish interagency
agreements governing the electronic exchange of data on providers and individuals collected,
maintained, or used by each agency when such exchange is outlined by each agency in an
interagency agreement to accomplish the purposes in clauses (1) to (4):

plan home care services;
   (2) to improve quality management of providers between state agencies;
   (3) to establish and maintain provider eligibility to participate as providers under Minnesota
health care programs; or

Each interagency agreement must include provisions to ensure anonymity of individuals, including
mandated reporters, and must outline the specific uses of and access to shared data within each
agency. Electronic interfaces between source data systems developed under these interagency
agreements must incorporate these provisions as well as other HIPPA provisions related to
individual data.

persons to the consumer support grant program from the family support program and personal
care assistant services, home health aide services, or private duty nursing services, the amount

      Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0641, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Facility in receivership. Subdivision 2 does not apply to the change of ownership
of a facility to a nonrelated organization while the facility to be sold, transferred or reorganized
is in receivership under section 144A.14, 144A.15, 245A.12, or 245A.13, and the commissioner
during the receivership has not determined the need to place residents of the facility into a newly
constructed or newly established facility. Nothing in this subdivision limits the liability of a former
owner.

for up to 60 days. The request must be received within the first 30 days of the disenrollment. If the
recipient's reenrollment in managed care is after the 60 days and before 90 days, the provider shall
request an additional 30-day extension of the current health plan authorization, for a total limit of
90 days from the time of disenrollment.

medical condition, and diagnosis or disability. The commissioner may publish additional criteria
for determining medical necessity according to section 256B.04.
   Subd. 13. Recovery of excessive payments. The commissioner shall seek monetary recovery
from providers of payments made for services which exceed the limits established in this section

provided to a recipient at the previously authorized level pending an appeal under section 256.045,
subdivision 10.
    Subd. 14. Referrals to Medicare providers required. Home care providers that do not

services and supplies and equipment. Providers must be terminated from participation in the
medical assistance program for failure to make these referrals.

ongoing quality assurance process for home care services to monitor program integrity, including
provider standards and training, consumer surveys, and random reviews of documentation.

of documentation of meeting provider standards, quality standards of care, correct billing practices,
and other information. Failure to comply with or to provide access and information to demonstrate
compliance with laws, rules, or policies may result in suspension, denial, or termination of the
provider agency's enrollment with the department.

for private duty nursing services shall be based on medical necessity and cost-effectiveness when
compared with alternative care options. The commissioner may authorize medically necessary
private duty nursing services in quarter-hour units when:
    (1) the recipient requires more individual and continuous care than can be provided during a
skilled nurse visit; or
   (2) the cares are outside of the scope of services that can be provided by a home health aide or
personal care assistant.
   (b) The commissioner may authorize:
    (1) up to two times the average amount of direct care hours provided in nursing facilities
statewide for case mix classification "K" as established by the annual cost report submitted to the
department by nursing facilities in May 1992;
   (2) private duty nursing in combination with other home care services up to the total cost allowed
under section 256B.0655, subdivision 4;
    (3) up to 16 hours per day if the recipient requires more nursing than the maximum number of
direct care hours as established in clause (1) and the recipient meets the hospital admission criteria
established under Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0501 to 9505.0540.
    (c) The commissioner may authorize up to 16 hours per day of medically necessary private duty
nursing services or up to 24 hours per day of medically necessary private duty nursing services
until such time as the commissioner is able to make a determination of eligibility for recipients who
are cooperatively applying for home care services under the community alternative care program
developed under section 256B.49, or until it is determined by the appropriate regulatory agency
that a health benefit plan is or is not required to pay for appropriate medically necessary health care
services. Recipients or their representatives must cooperatively assist the commissioner in obtaining

    (i) The commissioner shall provide a rate methodology for shared private duty nursing. For two
persons sharing nursing care, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed 1.5 times the regular private
duty nursing rates paid for serving a single individual by a registered nurse or licensed practical
nurse. These rates apply only to situations in which both recipients are present and receive shared
private duty nursing care on the date for which the service is billed.

services that require specialized nursing skills and are provided by parents of minor children, family
foster parents, spouses, and legal guardians who are providing private duty nursing care under the
following conditions:
   (1) the provision of these services is not legally required of the parents, spouses, or legal
guardians;
     (2) the services are necessary to prevent hospitalization of the recipient; and
   (3) the recipient is eligible for state plan home care or a home and community-based waiver and
one of the following hardship criteria are met:
   (i) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian resigns from a part-time or full-time job to provide
nursing care for the recipient; ­
                                o­r

services to meet the medical needs of the recipient.
    (b) Private duty nursing may be provided by a parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal
guardian who is a nurse licensed in Minnesota. Private duty nursing services provided by a parent,
spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian cannot be used in lieu of nursing services covered and
available under liable third-party payors, including Medicare. The private duty nursing provided
by a parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian must be included in the service ­    p­a

residence and provided by the parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian may not exceed
50 percent of the total approved nursing hours, or eight hours per day, whichever is less, up to a
maximum of 40 hours per week. A parent or parents, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian
shall not provide more than 40 hours of services in a seven-day period. For parents, family foster
parents, and legal guardians, 40 hours is the total amount allowed regardless of the number of
children or adults who receive services. Nothing in this subdivision precludes the parent's, spouse's,
or legal guardian's obligation of assuming the nonreimbursed family responsibilities of emergency
backup caregiver and primary caregiver.

must occur at least annually or when there is a significant change in the recipient's condition or when
there is a change in the need for personal care assistant services. A service update may substitute
for the annual face-to-face assessment when there is not a significant change in recipient condition
or a change in the need for personal care assistant service. A service update may be completed
by telephone, used when there is no need for an increase in personal care assistant services, and
used for two consecutive assessments if followed by a face-to-face assessment. A service update
must be completed on a form approved by the commissioner. A service update or review for
temporary increase includes a review of initial baseline data, evaluation of service effectiveness,
redetermination of service need, modification of service plan and appropriate referrals, update of
initial forms, obtaining service authorization, and on going consumer education. Assessments must
be completed on forms provided by the commissioner within 30 days of a request for home care
services by a recipient or responsible party or personal care provider agency.

    (f) Misuse and abuse of the flexible use of personal care assistance services resulting in the
overuse of units in a manner where the recipient will not have enough units to meet their needs for

recipients to service authorizations of no more than one month in duration; (2) requiring the recipient
to have a responsible party; and (3) requiring a qualified professional to monitor and report services

   (1) the home residence or family foster care home of one or more of the individual recipients; or
    (2) a child care program licensed under chapter 245A or operated by a local school district or
private school.
   (d) Shared personal care assistance services follow the same criteria for covered services as

the responsible party, in conjunction with the qualified professional, shall arrange the setting and
grouping of shared services based on the individual needs and preferences of the recipients. The
personal care assistance provider agency shall offer the recipient or the responsible party the option
of shared or one-on-one personal care assistance services or a combination of both. The recipient or

    (g) Authorization for the shared service option must be determined by the commissioner based
on the criteria that the shared service is appropriate to meet all of the recipients' needs and their health
and safety is maintained. The authorization of shared services is part of the overall authorization of
personal care assistance services. Nothing in this subdivision must be construed to reduce the total
number of hours authorized for an individual recipient.
   (h) A personal care assistant providing shared personal care assistance services must:
   (1) receive training specific for each recipient served; and
   (2) follow all required documentation requirements for time and services provided.

not exceed one and one-half times the rate paid for serving a single individual, and for three persons
sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed twice the rate paid for serving a single
individual. These rates apply only when all of the criteria for the shared care personal care assistance
service have been met.
    Subd. 18. Personal care assistance choice option; generally. (a) The commissioner may allow

paying and accounting for medically necessary covered personal care assistance services. Unless
otherwise provided in this section, all other statutory and regulatory provisions relating to personal
care assistance services apply to a recipient using the personal care assistance choice option.
    (b) Personal care assistance choice is an option of the personal care assistance program that
allows the recipient who receives personal care assistance services to be responsible for the hiring,
training, scheduling, and firing of personal care assistants. This program offers greater control and
choice for the recipient in who provides the personal care assistance service and when the service is
scheduled. The recipient or the recipient's responsible party must choose a personal care assistance
choice provider agency as a fiscal intermediary. This personal care assistance choice provider agency

   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Transition assistance. (a) A long-term care consultation team shall provide assistance
to persons residing in a nursing facility, hospital, regional treatment center, or intermediate care
facility for persons with developmental disabilities who request or are referred for assistance.
Transition assistance must include assessment, community support plan development, referrals to
long-term care options counseling under section 256B.975, subdivision 10, for community support
plan implementation and to Minnesota health care programs, and referrals to programs that provide
assistance with housing. Transition assistance must also include information about the Centers for
Independent Living and the Senior LinkAge Line, and about other organizations that can provide
assistance with relocation efforts, and information about contacting these organizations to obtain
their assistance and support.
   (b) The county shall develop transition processes with institutional social workers and discharge
planners to ensure that:
   (1) persons admitted to facilities receive information about transition assistance that is available;
   (2) the assessment is completed for persons within ten working days of the date of request or
recommendation for assessment; and
    (3) there is a plan for transition and follow-up for the individual's return to the community. The
plan must require notification of other local agencies when a person who may require assistance is
screened by one county for admission to a facility located in another county.
    (c) If a person who is eligible for a Minnesota health care program is admitted to a nursing
facility, the nursing facility must include a consultation team member or the case manager in the
discharge planning process.

care needs in making informed choices among options that include the most cost-effective and
least restrictive settings, and to delay spenddown to eligibility for publicly funded programs by
connecting people to alternative services in their homes before transition to housing with services.
Regardless of the consultation, prospective residents maintain the right to choose housing with
services or assisted living if that option is their preference.
    (b) Transitional consultation services are provided as determined by the commissioner of human
services in partnership with county long-term care consultation units, and the Area Agencies on
Aging, and are a combination of telephone-based and in-person assistance provided under models
developed by the commissioner. The consultation shall be performed in a manner that provides
objective and complete information. Transitional consultation must be provided within five working
days of the request of the prospective resident as follows:
   (1) the consultation must be provided by a qualified professional as determined by the
commissioner;
    (2) the consultation must include a review of the prospective resident's reasons for considering
assisted living, the prospective resident's personal goals, a discussion of the prospective resident's
immediate and projected long-term care needs, and alternative community services or assisted living
settings that may meet the prospective resident's needs; and
    (3) the prospective resident shall be informed of the availability of long-term care consultation
services described in subdivision 3a that are available at no charge to the prospective resident
to assist the prospective resident in assessment and planning to meet the prospective resident's
long-term care needs. The Senior LinkAge Line and long-term care consultation team shall give
the highest priority to referrals who are at highest risk of nursing facility placement or as needed
for determining eligibility.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Preadmission screening activities related to nursing facility admissions. (a) All
applicants to Medicaid certified nursing facilities, including certified boarding care facilities, must
be screened prior to admission regardless of income, assets, or funding sources for nursing facility
care, except as described in subdivision 4b. The purpose of the screening is to determine the need
for nursing facility level of care as described in paragraph (d) and to complete activities required
under federal law related to mental illness and developmental disability as outlined in paragraph (b).
    (b) A person who has a diagnosis or possible diagnosis of mental illness or developmental
disability must receive a preadmission screening before admission regardless of the exemptions
outlined in subdivision 4b, paragraph (b), to identify the need for further evaluation and specialized
services, unless the admission prior to screening is authorized by the local mental health authority
or the local developmental disabilities case manager, or unless authorized by the county agency
according to Public Law 101-508.
   The following criteria apply to the preadmission screening:
    (1) the county must use forms and criteria developed by the commissioner to identify persons
who require referral for further evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services;
and
   (2) the evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services must be done by:

   (i) a qualified independent mental health professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of a serious mental illness; or
    (ii) a qualified developmental disability professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of developmental disability. For purposes of this requirement, a qualified developmental
disability professional must meet the standards for a qualified developmental disability professional
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.430.
    (c) The local county mental health authority or the state developmental disability authority under
Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508 may prohibit admission to a nursing facility if the
individual does not meet the nursing facility level of care criteria or needs specialized services as
defined in Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508. For purposes of this section, "specialized
services" for a person with developmental disability means active treatment as that term is defined
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.440 (a)(1).
    (d) The determination of the need for nursing facility level of care must be made according to
criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, and 256B.092, using forms developed by
the commissioner. In assessing a person's needs, consultation team members shall have a physician
available for consultation and shall consider the assessment of the individual's attending physician,
if any. The individual's physician must be included if the physician chooses to participate. Other
personnel may be included on the team as deemed appropriate by the county.

     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Payment for long-term care consultation services. (a) The total payment for each
county must be paid monthly by certified nursing facilities in the county. The monthly amount to
be paid by each nursing facility for each fiscal year must be determined by dividing the county's
annual allocation for long-term care consultation services by 12 to determine the monthly payment
and allocating the monthly payment to each nursing facility based on the number of licensed beds
in the nursing facility. Payments to counties in which there is no certified nursing facility must be
made by increasing the payment rate of the two facilities located nearest to the county seat.
    (b) The commissioner shall include the total annual payment determined under paragraph (a)
for each nursing facility reimbursed under section 256B.431 or 256B.434 according to section
256B.431, subdivision 2b, paragraph (g).
   (c) In the event of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway of 25
percent or more of the beds in a facility, the commissioner may adjust the per diem payment amount

in paragraph (b) and may adjust the monthly payment amount in paragraph (a). The effective date
of an adjustment made under this paragraph shall be on or after the first day of the month following
the effective date of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway.
   (d) Payments for long-term care consultation services are available to the county or counties to
cover staff salaries and expenses to provide the services described in subdivision 1a. The county
shall employ, or contract with other agencies to employ, within the limits of available funding,
sufficient personnel to provide long-term care consultation services while meeting the state's
long-term care outcomes and objectives as defined in section 256B.0917, subdivision 1. The
county shall be accountable for meeting local objectives as approved by the commissioner in the
biennial home and community-based services quality assurance plan on a form provided by the
commissioner.
   (e) Notwithstanding section 256B.0641, overpayments attributable to payment of the screening
costs under the medical assistance program may not be recovered from a facility.
    (f) The commissioner of human services shall amend the Minnesota medical assistance plan to
include reimbursement for the local consultation teams.
    (g) The county may bill, as case management services, assessments, support planning, and
follow-along provided to persons determined to be eligible for case management under Minnesota
health care programs. No individual or family member shall be charged for an initial assessment or
initial support plan development provided under subdivision 3a or 3b.
   (h) The commissioner shall develop an alternative payment methodology for long-term care
consultation services that includes the funding available under this subdivision, and sections
256B.092 and 256B.0659. In developing the new payment methodology, the commissioner shall
consider the maximization of federal funding for this activity.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Reimbursement for certified nursing facilities. (a) Medical assistance reimbursement
for nursing facilities shall be authorized for a medical assistance recipient only if a preadmission
screening has been conducted prior to admission or the county has authorized an exemption. Medical
assistance reimbursement for nursing facilities shall not be provided for any recipient who the local
screener has determined does not meet the level of care criteria for nursing facility placement in
section 144.0724, subdivision 11, or, if indicated, has not had a level II OBRA evaluation as required
under the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 completed unless an admission for a
recipient with mental illness is approved by the local mental health authority or an admission for a
recipient with developmental disability is approved by the state developmental disability authority.
    (b) The nursing facility must not bill a person who is not a medical assistance recipient
for resident days that preceded the date of completion of screening activities as required under
subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c. The nursing facility must include unreimbursed resident days in the
nursing facility resident day totals reported to the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. The section is effective January 1, 2011.

services under the alternative care program. Effective January 1, 2011, this determination must be
made according to the criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11;
   (2) the person is age 65 or older;
    (3) the person would be eligible for medical assistance within 135 days of admission to a nursing
facility;
    (4) the person is not ineligible for the payment of long-term care services by the medical
assistance program due to an asset transfer penalty under section 256B.0595 or equity interest in
the home exceeding $500,000 as stated in section 256B.056;
   (5) the person needs long-term care services that are not funded through other state or federal
funding;
    (6) except for individuals described in clause (7), the monthly cost of the alternative care services
funded by the program for this person does not exceed 75 percent of the monthly limit described
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a. This monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care
client from payment for additional services, but in no case may the cost of additional services
purchased under this section exceed the difference between the client's monthly service limit defined
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3, and the alternative care program monthly service limit
defined in this paragraph. If care-related supplies and equipment or environmental modifications
and adaptations are or will be purchased for an alternative care services recipient, the costs may be
prorated on a monthly basis for up to 12 consecutive months beginning with the month of purchase. If
the monthly cost of a recipient's other alternative care services exceeds the monthly limit established
in this paragraph, the annual cost of the alternative care services shall be determined. In this event,
the annual cost of alternative care services shall not exceed 12 times the monthly limit described in
this paragraph; ­an

    (7) for individuals assigned a case mix classification A as described under section 256B.0915,
subdivision 3a, paragraph (a), with (i) no dependencies in activities of daily living, (ii) only one
dependency in bathing, dressing, grooming, or walking, or (iii) a dependency score of less than
three if eating is the only dependency as determined by an assessment performed under section
256B.0911, the monthly cost of alternative care services funded by the program cannot exceed $600
per month for all new participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1, 2009. This monthly
limit shall be applied to all other participants who meet this criteria at reassessment. This monthly
limit shall be increased annually as described in section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, paragraph (a).
This monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services,
but in no case may the cost of additional services purchased exceed the difference between the
client's monthly service limit defined in this clause and the limit described in clause (6) for case mix
classification A; and
   (8) the person is making timely payments of the assessed monthly fee.
A person is ineligible if payment of the fee is over 60 days past due, unless the person agrees to:

     (i) the appointment of a representative payee;
     (ii) automatic payment from a financial account;
     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
     (iv) another method acceptable to the lead agency to ensure prompt fee payments.
    The lead agency may extend the client's eligibility as necessary while making arrangements to
facilitate payment of past-due amounts and future premium payments. Following disenrollment due
to nonpayment of a monthly fee, eligibility shall not be reinstated for a period of 30 days.
    (b) Alternative care funding under this subdivision is not available for a person who is a medical
assistance recipient or who would be eligible for medical assistance without a spenddown or waiver
obligation. A person whose initial application for medical assistance and the elderly waiver program
is being processed may be served under the alternative care program for a period up to 60 days. If
the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for
services payable under the federally approved elderly waiver plan and delivered from the date the
individual was found eligible for the federally approved elderly waiver plan. Notwithstanding this
provision, alternative care funds may not be used to pay for any service the cost of which: (i) is
payable by medical assistance; (ii) is used by a recipient to meet a waiver obligation; or (iii) is used
to pay a medical assistance income spenddown for a person who is eligible to participate in the
federally approved elderly waiver program under the special income standard provision.
    (c) Alternative care funding is not available for a person who resides in a licensed nursing home,
certified boarding care home, hospital, or intermediate care facility, except for case management
services which are provided in support of the discharge planning process for a nursing home resident
or certified boarding care home resident to assist with a relocation process to a community-based
setting.
    (d) Alternative care funding is not available for a person whose income is greater than the
maintenance needs allowance under section 256B.0915, subdivision 1d, but equal to or less than
120 percent of the federal poverty guideline effective July 1 in the fiscal year for which alternative
care eligibility is determined, who would be eligible for the elderly waiver with a waiver obligation.
     Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3a. Elderly waiver cost limits. (a) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services
to an individual elderly waiver client except for individuals described in paragraph (b) shall be the
weighted average monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly
waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the
recipient's maintenance needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the
first day of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section
256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is implemented. Effective on the first day of the state
fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing
home rate determination is implemented and the first day of each subsequent state fiscal year, the
monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client shall be the rate
of the case mix resident class to which the waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, in effect on the last day of the previous state fiscal year, adjusted

by the greater of any legislatively adopted home and community-based services percentage rate
increase or the average statewide percentage increase in nursing facility payment rates.
    (b) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client
assigned to a case mix classification A under paragraph (a) with (1) no dependencies in activities
of daily living, (2) only one dependency in bathing, dressing, grooming, or walking, or (3) a
dependency score of less than three if eating is the only dependency, shall be the lower of the
case mix classification amount for case mix A as determined under paragraph (a) or the case
mix classification amount for case mix A effective on October 1, 2008, per month for all new
participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1, 2009. This monthly limit shall be applied to
all other participants who meet this criteria at reassessment.
    (c) If extended medical supplies and equipment or environmental modifications are or will be
purchased for an elderly waiver client, the costs may be prorated for up to 12 consecutive months
beginning with the month of purchase. If the monthly cost of a recipient's waivered services exceeds
the monthly limit established in paragraph (a) or (b), the annual cost of all waivered services shall
be determined. In this event, the annual cost of all waivered services shall not exceed 12 times the
monthly limit of waivered services as described in paragraph (a) or (b).

not include rent or raw food costs.
    (f) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payment rates shall not exceed
the 95 percentile of statewide monthly authorizations for 24-hour customized living services in
effect and in the Medicaid management information systems on March 31, 2009, for each case
mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
    (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
alternative payment rate systems for 24-hour customized living services in housing with services
establishments which are freestanding buildings with a capacity of 16 or fewer, by applying a single
hourly rate for covered component services provided in either:
   (1) licensed corporate adult foster homes; or
   (2) specialized dementia care units which meet the requirements of section 144D.065 and in
which:
   (i) each resident is offered the option of having their own apartment; or
    (ii) the units are licensed as board and lodge establishments with maximum capacity of eight
residents, and which meet the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 9555.6205, subparts 1, 2, 3,
and 4, item A.
   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Assessments and reassessments for waiver clients. (a) Each client shall receive an
initial assessment of strengths, informal supports, and need for services in accordance with section
256B.0911, subdivisions 3, 3a, and 3b. A reassessment of a client served under the elderly waiver
must be conducted at least every 12 months and at other times when the case manager determines
that there has been significant change in the client's functioning. This may include instances where
the client is discharged from the hospital. There must be a determination that the client requires
nursing facility level of care as defined in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, at initial and subsequent
assessments to initiate and maintain participation in the waiver program.
    (b) Regardless of other assessments identified in section 144.0724, subdivision 4, as appropriate
to determine nursing facility level of care for purposes of medical assistance payment for nursing
facility services, only face-to-face assessments conducted according to section 256B.0911,
subdivisions 3a and 3b, that result in a nursing facility level of care determination will be accepted
for purposes of initial and ongoing access to waiver service payment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:

    Subd. 10. Waiver payment rates; managed care organizations. The commissioner shall
adjust the elderly waiver capitation payment rates for managed care organizations paid under
section 256B.69, subdivisions 6a and 23, to reflect the maximum service rate limits for customized
living services and 24-hour customized living services under subdivisions 3e and 3h for the
contract period beginning October 1, 2009. Medical assistance rates paid to customized living
providers by managed care organizations under this section shall not exceed the maximum service
rate limits determined by the commissioner under subdivisions 3e and 3h.
    Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0916, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Distribution of funds; partnerships. (a) Beginning with fiscal year 2000, the
commissioner shall distribute all funding available for home and community-based waiver services
for persons with developmental disabilities to individual counties or to groups of counties that
form partnerships to jointly plan, administer, and authorize funding for eligible individuals. The
commissioner shall encourage counties to form partnerships that have a sufficient number of
recipients and funding to adequately manage the risk and maximize use of available resources.
    (b) Counties must submit a request for funds and a plan for administering the program as required
by the commissioner. The plan must identify the number of clients to be served, their ages, and their
priority listing based on:
    (1) requirements in Minnesota Rules, part 9525.1880; and

requesting to receive the identified services. The county of service may refuse to concur if:
    (1) it can demonstrate that the provider is unable to provide the services identified in the person's
individual service plan as services that are needed and are to be provided; or

     (c) The county of service shall notify the county of financial responsibility of concurrence or
refusal to concur no later than 20 working days following receipt of the written request. Unless
other mutually acceptable arrangements are made by the involved county agencies, the county
of financial responsibility is responsible for costs of social services and the costs associated with
the development and maintenance of the placement. The county of service may request that the
county of financial responsibility purchase case management services from the county of service or
from a contracted provider of case management when the county of financial responsibility is not
providing case management as defined in this section and rules adopted under this section, unless
other mutually acceptable arrangements are made by the involved county agencies. Standards for
payment limits under this section may be established by the commissioner. Financial disputes
between counties shall be resolved as provided in section 256G.09.
      Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Residential support services. (a) Upon federal approval, there is established a new
service called residential support that is available on the CAC, CADI, DD, and TBI waivers. Existing
waiver service descriptions must be modified to the extent necessary to ensure there is no duplication
between other services. Residential support services must be provided by vendors licensed as a
community residential setting as defined in section 245A.11, subdivision 8.
      (b) Residential support services must meet the following criteria:
      (1) providers of residential support services must own or control the residential site;
      (2) the residential site must not be the primary residence of the license holder;
   (3) the residential site must have a designated program supervisor responsible for program
oversight, development, and implementation of policies and procedures;
    (4) the provider of residential support services must provide supervision, training, and assistance
as described in the person's community support plan; and

   (5) the provider of residential support services must meet the requirements of licensure and
additional requirements of the person's community support plan.
    (c) Providers of residential support services that meet the definition in paragraph (a) must be
registered using a process determined by the commissioner beginning July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Waivered services statewide priorities. (a) The commissioner shall establish
statewide priorities for individuals on the waiting list for developmental disabilities (DD) waiver
services, as of January 1, 2010. The statewide priorities must include, but are not limited to,
individuals who continue to have a need for waiver services after they have maximized the use
of state plan services and other funding resources, including natural supports, prior to accessing
waiver services, and who meet at least one of the following criteria:
    (1) have unstable living situations due to the age, incapacity, or sudden loss of the primary
caregivers;
   (2) are moving from an institution due to bed closures;
   (3) experience a sudden closure of their current living arrangement;
   (4) require protection from confirmed abuse, neglect, or exploitation;
   (5) experience a sudden change in need that can no longer be met through state plan services or
other funding resources alone; or
   (6) meet other priorities established by the department.
    (b) When allocating resources to lead agencies, the commissioner must take into consideration
the number of individuals waiting who meet statewide priorities and the lead agencies' current use
of waiver funds and existing service options.
    (c) The commissioner shall evaluate the impact of the use of statewide priorities and provide
recommendations to the legislature on whether to continue the use of statewide priorities in the
November 1, 2011, annual report required by the commissioner in sections 256B.0916, subdivision
7, and 256B.49, subdivision 21.
   Sec. 55. [256B.0948] FOSTER CARE RATE LIMITS.
    The commissioner shall decrease by five percent rates for adult foster care and supportive living
services that are reimbursed under section 256B.092 or 256B.49, and are above the 95th percentile
of the statewide rates for the service. The reduction in rates shall take into account the acuity of
individuals served based on the methodology used to allocate dollars to local lead agency budgets,
and assure that affected service rates are not reduced below the rate level represented by the above
percentile due to this rate change. Lead agency contracts for services specified in this section shall
be amended to implement these rate changes for services rendered on or after July 1, 2009. The
commissioner shall make corresponding reductions to waiver allocations and capitated rates.
   Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.37, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Subrogation. Upon furnishing medical assistance or alternative care services
51ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                          4829

under section 256B.0913 to any person who has private accident or health care coverage, or receives
or has a right to receive health or medical care from any type of organization or entity, or has a
cause of action arising out of an occurrence that necessitated the payment of medical assistance,
the state agency or the state agency's agent shall be subrogated, to the extent of the cost of medical
care furnished, to any rights the person may have under the terms of the coverage, or against the
organization or entity providing or liable to provide health or medical care, or under the cause of
action.
    The right of subrogation created in this section includes all portions of the cause of action,
notwithstanding any settlement allocation or apportionment that purports to dispose of portions of
the cause of action not subject to subrogation.
    Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.37, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Private benefits to be used first. Private accident and health care coverage including
Medicare for medical services is primary coverage and must be exhausted before medical assistance
­s
i­ or alternative care services are paid for medical services including home health care, personal
care assistant services, hospice, supplies and equipment, or services covered under a Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services waiver. When a person who is otherwise eligible for medical
assistance has private accident or health care coverage, including Medicare or a prepaid health plan,
the private health care benefits available to the person must be used first and to the fullest extent.
    Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.434, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Alternate rates for nursing facilities. (a) For nursing facilities which have their
payment rates determined under this section rather than section 256B.431, the commissioner shall
establish a rate under this subdivision. The nursing facility must enter into a written contract with
the commissioner.
    (b) A nursing facility's case mix payment rate for the first rate year of a facility's contract under
this section is the payment rate the facility would have received under section 256B.431.
    (c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a
facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an
inflation adjustment and, for facilities reimbursed under this section or section 256B.431, an
adjustment to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing fees for the facility
taking effect on or after July 1, 2001. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted by
the commissioner of finance's national economic consultant, as forecasted in the fourth quarter of
the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be based on the 12-month
period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the rate year for which the
rate is being determined. For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1999, July 1, 2000, July 1, 2001,
July 1, 2002, July 1, 2003, July 1, 2004, July 1, 2005, July 1, 2006, July 1, 2007, July 1, 2008,

                        ­ October 1, 2010, October 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. This paragraph
shall apply only to the property-related payment rate, except that adjustments to include the cost
of any increase in Health Department licensing fees taking effect on or after July 1, 2001, shall
be provided. Beginning in 2005, adjustment to the property payment rate under this section and
section 256B.431 shall be effective on October 1. In determining the amount of the property-related
payment rate adjustment under this paragraph, the commissioner shall determine the proportion of
the facility's rates that are property-related based on the facility's most recent cost report.
4830                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [51ST DAY

    (d) The commissioner shall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent
above a facility's operating payment rate for achieving outcomes specified in a contract. The
commissioner may solicit contract amendments and implement those which, on a competitive
basis, best meet the state's policy objectives. The commissioner shall limit the amount of any
incentive payment and the number of contract amendments under this paragraph to operate the
incentive payments within funds appropriated for this purpose. The contract amendments may
specify various levels of payment for various levels of performance. Incentive payments to facilities
under this paragraph may be in the form of time-limited rate adjustments or onetime supplemental
payments. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria, the commissioner shall
consider the following state policy objectives:
   (1) successful diversion or discharge of residents to the residents' prior home or other
community-based alternatives;
   (2) adoption of new technology to improve quality or efficiency;
   (3) improved quality as measured in the Nursing Home Report Card;
   (4) reduced acute care costs; and
   (5) any additional outcomes proposed by a nursing facility that the commissioner finds desirable.
    (e) Notwithstanding the threshold in section 256B.431, subdivision 16, facilities that take action
to come into compliance with existing or pending requirements of the life safety code provisions or
federal regulations governing sprinkler systems must receive reimbursement for the costs associated
with compliance if all of the following conditions are met:
   (1) the expenses associated with compliance occurred on or after January 1, 2005, and before
December 31, 2008;
   (2) the costs were not otherwise reimbursed under subdivision 4f or section 144A.071 or
144A.073; and
    (3) the total allowable costs reported under this paragraph are less than the minimum threshold
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 15, paragraph (e), and subdivision 16.
The commissioner shall use money appropriated for this purpose to provide to qualifying nursing
facilities a rate adjustment beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30, 2008. Nursing
facilities that have spent money or anticipate the need to spend money to satisfy the most recent life
safety code requirements by (1) installing a sprinkler system or (2) replacing all or portions of an
existing sprinkler system may submit to the commissioner by June 30, 2007, on a form provided by
the commissioner the actual costs of a completed project or the estimated costs, based on a project
bid, of a planned project. The commissioner shall calculate a rate adjustment equal to the allowable
costs of the project divided by the resident days reported for the report year ending September 30,
2006. If the costs from all projects exceed the appropriation for this purpose, the commissioner shall
allocate the money appropriated on a pro rata basis to the qualifying facilities by reducing the rate
adjustment determined for each facility by an equal percentage. Facilities that used estimated costs
when requesting the rate adjustment shall report to the commissioner by January 31, 2009, on the
use of this money on a form provided by the commissioner. If the nursing facility fails to provide the
report, the commissioner shall recoup the money paid to the facility for this purpose. If the facility
reports expenditures allowable under this subdivision that are less than the amount received in the
51ST DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                            4831

facility's annualized rate adjustment, the commissioner shall recoup the difference.
      Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.434, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 21. Payment of post-PERA pension benefit costs. Nursing facilities that convert or
converted after September 30, 2006, from public to private ownership shall have a portion of their
post-PERA pension costs treated as a component of the historic operating rate. Effective for the
rate years beginning on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to October 1, 2016, the commissioner
shall determine the pension costs to be included in the facility's base for determining rates under this
section by using the following formula: post-privatization pension benefit costs as a percent of salary
shall be determined from either the cost report for the first full reporting year after privatization or the
most recent report year available, whichever is later. This percentage shall be applied to the salary
costs of the alternative payment system base rate year to determine the allowable amount of pension
costs. The adjustments provided for in sections 256B.431, 256B.434, 256B.441, and any other law
enacted after the base rate year and prior to the year for which rates are being determined shall be
applied to the allowable amount. The adjusted allowable amount shall be added to the operating rate
effective the first rate year PERA ceases to remain as a pass-through component of the rate.
      Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.437, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Planned closure rate adjustment. (a) The commissioner of human services shall
calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), for up to 5,140 beds according to clauses (1) to (4):
      (1) the amount available is the net reduction of nursing facility beds multiplied by $2,080;
   (2) the total number of beds in the nursing facility or facilities receiving the planned closure rate
adjustment must be identified;
      (3) capacity days are determined by multiplying the number determined under clause (2) by 365;
and
   (4) the planned closure rate adjustment is the amount available in clause (1), divided by capacity
days determined under clause (3).
    (b) A planned closure rate adjustment under this section is effective on the first day of the month
following completion of closure of the facility designated for closure in the application and becomes
part of the nursing facility's total operating payment rate.
    (c) Applicants may use the planned closure rate adjustment to allow for a property payment for
a new nursing facility or an addition to an existing nursing facility or as an operating payment rate
adjustment. Applications approved under this subdivision are exempt from other requirements for
moratorium exceptions under section 144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 3.
   (d) Upon the request of a closing facility, the commissioner must allow the facility a closure rate
adjustment as provided under section 144A.161, subdivision 10.
    (e) A facility that has received a planned closure rate adjustment may reassign it to another
facility that is under the same ownership at any time within three years of its effective date. The
amount of the adjustment shall be computed according to paragraph (a).
      (f) If the per bed dollar amount specified in paragraph (a), clause (1), is increased, the
4832                                                      JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                      [51ST DAY

commissioner shall recalculate planned closure rate adjustments for facilities that delicense beds
under this section on or after July 1, 2001, to reflect the increase in the per bed dollar amount. The
recalculated planned closure rate adjustment shall be effective from the date the per bed dollar
amount is increased.
   (g) For planned closures approved after June 30, 2009, the commissioner of human services
shall calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), according to paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (4).
      Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.441, subdivision 55, is amended to read:
     Subd. 55. Phase-in of rebased operating payment rates. (a) For the rate years beginning
October 1, 2008, to October 1, 2015, the operating payment rate calculated under this section
shall be phased in by blending the operating rate with the operating payment rate determined
under section 256B.434. For purposes of this subdivision, the rate to be used that is determined
under section 256B.434 shall not include the portion of the operating payment rate related to
performance-based incentive payments under section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph (d). For
the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 13
percent of the operating payment rate from this section, and 87 percent of the operating payment
rate from section 256B.434. For the rate ­                              y­e­a­r period beginning October 1, 2009, through September
30, 2013, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 14 percent of the operating payment
rate from this section, and 86 percent of the operating payment rate from section 256B.434. F                                                                          ­­

review the consolidated standards under chapter 245B and the supervised living facility rule under
Minnesota Rules, chapter 4665, to determine what provisions in Minnesota Rules, chapter 4665,
may be waived by the commissioner of health for intermediate care facilities in order to enable
facilities to implement the performance measures in their contract and provide quality services to
residents without a duplication of or increase in regulatory requirements.
   Sec. 71. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.5012, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 8. ICF/MR rate decreases effective July 1, 2009. Effective July 1, 2009, the
commissioner shall decrease each facility reimbursed under this section operating payment
adjustments equal to 2.58 percent of the operating payment rates in effect on June 30, 2009. For
each facility, the commissioner shall implement the rate reduction, based on occupied beds, using
the percentage specified in this subdivision multiplied by the total payment rate, including the
variable rate but excluding the property-related payment rate, in effect on the preceding date. The
total rate reduction shall include the adjustment provided in section 256B.502, subdivision 7.
   Sec. 72. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and sections
256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical assistance
and general assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each
performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except
in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of
each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a
broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan
efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner
may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan,
including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned
no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The
commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23. A managed care
plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include as admitted assets
under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph that is reasonably expected to be

returned.
    (d)(1) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, the commissioner shall
withhold three percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical
assistance and general assistance medical care programs. The withheld funds must be returned no
sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the following year. The commissioner may exclude
special demonstration projects under subdivision 23.
    (2) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include
as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph. The return of
the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (c).
    (e) Effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall require
that managed care plans use the assessment and authorization processes, forms, timelines, standards,
documentation, and data reporting requirements, protocols, billing processes, and policies consistent
with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract requirements
consistent with medical assistance fee-for-service or the Department of Human Services contract
requirements for all personal care assistance services under section 256B.0659.
   Sec. 73. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256D.44, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Special needs. In addition to the state standards of assistance established in subdivisions
1 to 4, payments are allowed for the following special needs of recipients of Minnesota supplemental
aid who are not residents of a nursing home, a regional treatment center, or a group residential
housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the
percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;
    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (8) lactose-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (9) antidumping diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan;
51ST DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                        4839

   (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
   (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding the language in this subdivision, an amount equal to the maximum
allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage.
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
    (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, recipients of home and community-based services may
relocate to services without 24-hour supervision and receive the equivalent of the recipient's
group residential housing allocation in Minnesota supplemental assistance shelter needy funding
if the cost of the services and housing is equal to or less than provided to the recipient in home
4840                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [51ST DAY

and community-based services and the relocation is the recipient's choice and is approved by the
recipient or guardian.
   (h) To access housing and services as provided in paragraph (g), the recipient may choose
housing that may or may not be owned, operated, or controlled by the recipient's service provider.
    (i) The provisions in paragraphs (g) and (h) are effective to June 30, 2011. The commissioner
shall assess the development of publicly owned housing, other housing alternatives, and whether
a public equity housing fund may be established that would maintain the state's interest, to the
extent paid from group residential housing and Minnesota supplemental aid shelter needy funds in
provider-owned housing so that when sold, the state would recover its share for a public equity fund
to be used for future public needs under this chapter. The commissioner shall report findings and
recommendations to the legislative committees and budget divisions with jurisdiction over health
and human services policy and financing by January 15, 2012.
    (j) In selecting prospective services needed by recipients for whom home and community-based
services have been authorized, the recipient and the recipient's guardian shall first consider
alternatives to home and community-based services. Minnesota supplemental aid shelter needy
funding for recipients who utilize Minnesota supplemental aid shelter needy funding as provided in
this section shall remain permanent unless the recipient with the recipient's guardian later chooses
to access home and community-based services.
   Sec. 74. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.556, subdivision 3c, is amended to read:

  Sec. 3. [402A.15] STEERING COMMITTEE ON PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOME
REFORMS.
    Subdivision 1. Duties. (a) The Steering Committee on Performance and Outcome Reforms
shall develop a uniform process to establish and review performance and outcome standards for
all essential human services based on the current level of resources available, and to develop
appropriate reporting measures and a uniform accountability process for responding to a county's or
human service authority's failure to make adequate progress on achieving performance measures.
The accountability process shall focus on the performance measures rather than inflexible
implementation requirements.
   (b) The steering committee shall:
   (1) by November 1, 2009, establish an agreed upon list of essential services;
    (2) by February 15, 2010, develop and recommend to the legislature a uniform, graduated
process, in addition to the remedies identified in section 402A.18, for responding to a county's
failure to make adequate progress on achieving performance measures; and
    (3) by December 15, 2012, for each essential service make recommendations to the legislature
regarding (1) performance measures and goals based on those measures for each essential service,
(2) a system for reporting on the performance measures and goals, and (3) appropriate resources,
including funding, needed to achieve those performance measures and goals. The resource
recommendations shall take into consideration program demand and the unique differences of local
areas in geography and the populations served. Priority shall be given to services with the greatest
variation in availability and greatest administrative demands. By January 15 of each year starting
January 15, 2011, the steering committee shall report its recommendations to the governor and
legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human services. As part of its report, the
steering committee shall, as appropriate, recommend statutory provisions, rules and requirements,
and reports that should be repealed or eliminated.
    (c) As far as possible, the performance measures, reporting system, and funding shall be
consistent across program areas. The development of performance measures shall consider the
manner in which data will be collected and performance will be reported. The steering committee
shall consider state and local administrative costs related to collecting data and reporting outcomes
when developing performance measures. The steering committee shall correlate the performance
measures and goals to available levels of resources, including state and local funding. The
steering committee shall take into consideration that the goal of implementing changes to program
monitoring and reporting the progress toward achieving outcomes is to significantly minimize
the cost of administrative requirements and to allow funds freed by reduced administrative
expenditures to be used to provide additional services, allow flexibility in service design and
management, and focus energies on achieving program and client outcomes.
    (d) In making its recommendations, the steering committee shall consider input from the
council established in section 402A.20. The steering committee shall review the measurable goals
established in a memorandum of understanding entered into under section 402A.30, subdivision 2,
paragraph (b), and consider whether they may be applied as statewide performance outcomes.
    (e) The steering committee shall form work groups that include persons who provide or receive
essential services and representatives of organizations who advocate on behalf of those persons.

    (f) By December 15, 2009, the steering committee shall establish a three-year schedule for
completion of its work. The schedule shall be published on the Department of Human Services Web

addition, the commissioner shall post quarterly updates on the progress of the steering committee
on the Department of Human Services Web site.

    (d) To promote information sharing and coordination between the steering committee and
council, one of the county representatives from paragraph (a), clause (2), and one of the county
representatives from paragraph (a), clause (3), must also serve as a representative on the council
under section 402A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), clause (5) or (6).

    (2) the council has conducted an assessment of the program outcome improvement plan
to determine if the county or service delivery authority has made satisfactory progress toward
performance outcomes and has made a recommendation about remedies to the commissioner. The
review and recommendation must be made to the commissioner within 12 months from the date
of the deficiency determination.

service delivery authority subject to the approval of the council and the commissioner.
   Subd. 2. New state-county governance framework. (a) To establish a service delivery
authority, each participating county and the state must enter into a binding memorandum of
understanding to establish a joint state-county service delivery framework:
       (b) The memorandum of understanding must:
       (1) comply with current state and federal law except where waivers are approved under clause
(7);
    (2) define the scope of essential services over which the service delivery authority has
jurisdiction;
    (3) designate a single administrative structure to oversee the delivery of services over which the
service delivery authority has jurisdiction and identify a single administrative agent for purposes of
contact and communication with the department;
    (4) define measurable performance and outcome goals in key operational areas that the service
delivery authority is expected to achieve, provided that the performance goals must, at a minimum,
satisfy performance outcomes recommended by the steering committee and enacted into law;

465.82 to establish procedures for local governments to merge, with the consent of the voters. Any
agreement under paragraph (b) must be governed by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter limits the

     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9501, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 26b. Renovation. "Renovation" means the modification of any affected property that
results in the disturbance of painted surfaces, unless that activity is performed as an abatement. A
renovation performed for the purpose of converting a building or part of a building into an affected
property is a renovation under this subdivision.

lead work outside of the person's property must obtain certification as a lead firm. The certificate
must be in writing, contain an expiration date, be signed by the commissioner, and give the name
and address of the person to whom it is issued. The certification fee is $100, is nonrefundable, and
must be submitted with each application. The certificate or a copy of the certificate must be readily
available at the worksite for review by the contracting entity, the commissioner, and other public
health officials charged with the health, safety, and welfare of the state's citizens.
     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9505, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Notice of regulated lead work. (a) At least five working days before starting work
at each regulated lead worksite, the person performing the regulated lead work shall give written
notice to the commissioner and the appropriate board of health.
    (b) This provision does not apply to lead hazard screen, lead inspection, lead risk assessment,
lead sampling technician, renovation, or lead project design activities.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9508, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Regulated lead work standards and methods. (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules
establishing regulated lead work standards and methods in accordance with the provisions of this
section, for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, and soil in a manner that protects public health and
the environment for all residences, including residences also used for a commercial purpose, child
care facilities, playgrounds, and schools.
    (b) In the rules required by this section, the commissioner shall require lead hazard reduction
of intact paint only if the commissioner finds that the intact paint is on a chewable or lead-dust
producing surface that is a known source of actual lead exposure to a specific individual. The

commissioner shall prohibit methods that disperse lead dust into the air that could accumulate to
a level that would exceed the lead dust standard specified under this section. The commissioner
shall work cooperatively with the commissioner of administration to determine which lead
hazard reduction methods adopted under this section may be used for lead-safe practices
including prohibited practices, preparation, disposal, and cleanup. The commissioner shall
work cooperatively with the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency to develop disposal
procedures. In adopting rules under this section, the commissioner shall require the best available
technology for regulated lead work methods, paint stabilization, and repainting.
    (c) The commissioner of health shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead
in bare soil in a manner to protect public health and the environment. The commissioner shall adopt
a maximum standard of 100 parts of lead per million in bare soil. The commissioner shall set a soil
replacement standard not to exceed 25 parts of lead per million. Soil lead hazard reduction methods
shall focus on erosion control and covering of bare soil.
    (d) The commissioner shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead in dust
in a manner to protect the public health and environment. Dust standards shall use a weight of lead
per area measure and include dust on the floor, on the window sills, and on window wells. Lead
hazard reduction methods for dust shall focus on dust removal and other practices which minimize
the formation of lead dust from paint, soil, or other sources.
    (e) The commissioner shall adopt lead hazard reduction standards and methods for lead in
drinking water both at the tap and public water supply system or private well in a manner to protect
the public health and the environment. The commissioner may adopt the rules for controlling lead
in drinking water as contained in Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, part 141. Drinking water
lead hazard reduction methods may include an educational approach of minimizing lead exposure
from lead in drinking water.
    (f) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall adopt rules to ensure that removal
of exterior lead-based coatings from residences and steel structures by abrasive blasting methods is
conducted in a manner that protects health and the environment.
   (g) All regulated lead work standards shall provide reasonable margins of safety that
are consistent with more than a summary review of scientific evidence and an emphasis on
overprotection rather than underprotection when the scientific evidence is ambiguous.
   (h) No unit of local government shall have an ordinance or regulation governing regulated lead
work standards or methods for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, or soil that require a different
regulated lead work standard or method than the standards or methods established under this section.
   (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (h), the commissioner may approve the use by a unit of local
government of an innovative lead hazard reduction method which is consistent in approach with
methods established under this section.
    (j) The commissioner shall adopt rules for issuing lead orders required under section 144.9504,
rules for notification of abatement or interim control activities requirements, and other rules
necessary to implement sections 144.9501 to 144.9512.
   (k) The commissioner shall adopt rules consistent with section 402(c)(3) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act to ensure that renovation in a pre-1978 affected property where a child or pregnant

     Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
51ST DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                       4863

   Subd. 3a. Available programs, categories, and analytes. (a) The commissioner shall accredit
laboratories that test samples under the following programs:
   (1) the clean water program, such as compliance monitoring under the federal Clean Water Act,
and ambient monitoring of surface and groundwater, or analysis of biological tissue;
   (2) the safe drinking water program, including compliance monitoring under the federal Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the state requirements for monitoring private wells;
   (3) the resource conservation and recovery program, including federal and state requirements for
monitoring solid and hazardous wastes, biological tissue, leachates, and groundwater monitoring
wells not intended as drinking water sources;
   (4) the underground storage tank program; and
   (5) the clean air program, including air and emissions testing under the federal Clean Air Act,
and state and federal requirements for vapor intrusion monitoring.
   (b) The commissioner shall maintain and publish a list of analytes available for accreditation.
The list must be reviewed at least once every six months and the changes published in the State
Register and posted on the program's Web site. The commissioner shall publish the notification of
changes and review comments on the changes no less than 30 days from the date the list is published.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3b. Additional fees. (a) Laboratories located outside of this state that require an on-site
assessment more frequent than once every two years must pay an additional assessed fee of $3,000
per assessment for each additional on-site assessment conducted. The laboratory must pay the fee
within 15 business days of receiving the commissioner's notification that an on-site assessment is
required. The commissioner may conduct additional on-site assessments to determine a laboratory's
continued compliance with the standards provided in subdivision 2a.
   (b) A late fee of $200 shall be added to the annual fee for accredited laboratories submitting
renewal applications to the commissioner after November 1.
    (c) A change fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests additional fields of testing at any
time other than when initially applying for or renewing its accreditation. A change fee does not
apply for applications to add fields of testing for new analytes in response to the published notice
under subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), if the laboratory holds valid accreditation for the changed test
category and applies for additional analytes within the same test category. The change fee is equal
to the applicable test category fee for the field of testing requested. An application that requests
accreditation of multiple fields of testing within a test category requires a single payment of the
applicable test category fee per application submitted.
    (d) A variance fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests a variance from a standard provided
in subdivision 2a. The variance fee is $500 per variance.
   (e) The commissioner shall assess a fee for changes to laboratory information regarding
ownership, name, address, or personnel. Laboratories must submit changes through the application
process under subdivision 6. The information update fee is $250 per application.
   (f) Fees must be set so that the total fees support the laboratory accreditation program. Direct

costs of the accreditation service include program administration, assessments, the agency's general
support costs, and attorney general costs attributable to the fee function.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3c. Refunds and nonpayment. Refunds or credits shall not be made for applications
received but not approved. Accreditation of a laboratory shall not be awarded until all fees are paid.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Application. (a) Laboratories seeking accreditation must apply on a form provided by
the commissioner, include the laboratory's procedures and quality manual, and pay the applicable
fees.
   (b) Laboratories may be fixed-base or mobile. The commissioner shall accredit mobile
laboratories individually and require a vehicle identification number, license plate number, or other
uniquely identifying information in addition to the application requirements of paragraph (a).
   (c) Laboratories maintained on separate properties, even though operated under the same
management or ownership, must apply separately. Laboratories with more than one building on the
same or adjoining properties do not need to submit a separate application.
    (d) The commissioner may accredit laboratories located out-of-state. Accreditation for
out-of-state laboratories may be obtained directly from the commissioner following the
requirements in paragraph (a), or out-of-state laboratories may be accredited through a reciprocal
agreement if the laboratory:
    (1) is accredited by a NELAP-recognized accreditation body for those fields of testing in which
the laboratory requests accreditation from the commissioner;
   (2) submits an application and documentation according to this subdivision; and
   (3) submits a current copy of the laboratory's unexpired accreditation from a NELAP-recognized
accreditation body showing the fields of accreditation for which the laboratory is currently
accredited.
    (e) Under the conflict of interest determinations provided in section 43A.38, subdivision 6,
clause (a), the commissioner shall not accredit governmental laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state. If accreditation is required, laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state must apply for accreditation through any other NELAP-recognized
accreditation body.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 6a. Implementation and effective date. All laboratories must comply with standards
under this section by July 1, 2009. Fees under subdivisions 3 and 3b apply to applications received
and accreditations issued after June 30, 2009. Accreditations issued on or before June 30, 2009,
shall expire upon their current expiration date.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
51ST DAY]                                                        MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                                                                        4865

    Subd. 7. Initial accreditation and annual accreditation renewal. (a) The commissioner
shall issue or renew accreditation after receipt of the completed application and documentation
required in this section, provided the laboratory maintains compliance with the standards specified
in subdivision 2a, and attests to the compliance on the application form.
   (b) The commissioner shall prorate the fees in subdivision 3 for laboratories applying for
accreditation after December 31. The fees are prorated on a quarterly basis beginning with the
quarter in which the commissioner receives the completed application from the laboratory.
   (c) Applications for renewal of accreditation must be received by November 1 and no earlier
than October 1 of each year. The commissioner shall send annual renewal notices to laboratories
90 days before expiration. Failure to receive a renewal notice does not exempt laboratories from
meeting the annual November 1 renewal date.
    (d) The commissioner shall issue all accreditations for the calendar year for which the application
is made, and the accreditation shall expire on December 31 of that year.
    (e) The accreditation of any laboratory that fails to submit a renewal application and fees to
the commissioner expires automatically on December 31 without notice or further proceeding.
Any person who operates a laboratory as accredited after expiration of accreditation or without
having submitted an application and paid the fees is in violation of the provisions of this section
and is subject to enforcement action under sections 144.989 to 144.993, the Health Enforcement
Consolidation Act. A laboratory with expired accreditation may reapply under subdivision 6.

equipment in a clean, orderly and sanitary condition. In any manufactured home park containing
more than 50 lots, the attendant, caretaker, or other responsible park employee, shall be readily
available at all times in case of emergency.
    (2) All manufactured home parks shall be well drained and be located so that the drainage
of the park area will not endanger any water supply. No wastewater from manufactured homes
or recreational camping vehicles shall be deposited on the surface of the ground. All sewage and
other water carried wastes shall be discharged into a municipal sewage system whenever available.
When a municipal sewage system is not available, a sewage disposal system acceptable to the state
commissioner of health shall be provided.
    (3) No manufactured home shall be located closer than three feet to the side lot lines of a
manufactured home park, if the abutting property is improved property, or closer than ten feet to a

homes including their attachments and at least three feet between manufactured homes when
parked end to end. The space between manufactured homes may be used for the parking of motor
vehicles and other property, if the vehicle or other property is parked at least ten feet from the
nearest adjacent manufactured home position. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply
to recreational camping areas and variances may be granted by the state commissioner of health
in manufactured home parks when the variance is applied for in writing and in the opinion of the
commissioner the variance will not endanger the health, safety, and welfare of manufactured home
park occupants.
    (4) An adequate supply of water of safe, sanitary quality shall be furnished at each manufactured
home park or recreational camping area. The source of the water supply shall first be approved by
the state Department of Health.

severe weather conditions, such as tornadoes, high winds, and floods. The shelter or evacuation plan
shall be developed with the assistance and approval of the municipality where the park is located
and shall be posted at conspicuous locations throughout the park. The park owner shall provide each
resident with a copy of the approved shelter or evacuation plan, as provided by section 327C.01,
subdivision 1c. Nothing in this paragraph requires the Department of Health to review or approve
any shelter or evacuation plan developed by a park. Failure of a municipality to approve a plan
submitted by a park shall not be grounds for action against the park by the Department of Health if
the park has made a good faith effort to develop the plan and obtain municipal approval.
     (7) A manufactured home park with ten or more manufactured homes, licensed prior to March
1, 1988, shall provide a safe place of shelter for park residents or a plan for the evacuation of park
residents to a safe place of shelter within a reasonable distance of the park for use by park residents
in times of severe weather, including tornadoes and high winds. The shelter or evacuation plan must
be approved by the municipality by March 1, 1989. The municipality may require the park owner
to construct a shelter if it determines that a safe place of shelter is not available within a reasonable
distance from the park. A copy of the municipal approval and the plan shall be submitted by the
park owner to the Department of Health. The park owner shall provide each resident with a copy of
the approved shelter or evacuation plan, as provided by section 327C.01, subdivision 1c.

Receipts for Systems Projects. Appropriations
and federal receipts for information systems
projects for MAXIS, PRISM, MMIS, and
SSIS must be deposited in the state system
account authorized in Minnesota Statutes,
section 256.014. Money appropriated
for computer projects approved by the
Minnesota Office of Enterprise Technology,
funded by the legislature, and approved

necessary, except that any transfers to
one project that exceed $1,000,000 or
multiple transfers to one project that exceed
$1,000,000 in total require the express

which the board is empowered to enforce and continued practice by the physician assistant would
create a serious risk of harm to the public. The suspension shall take effect upon written notice to

notice, the board shall schedule a disciplinary hearing to be held pursuant to the Administrative
Procedure Act.
51ST DAY]                                 MONDAY, MAY 11, 2009                                                 4961

    The physician assistant shall be provided with at least 20 days' notice of any hearing held
pursuant to this subdivision. The hearing shall be scheduled to begin no later than 30 days after the
issuance of the suspension order.
    Subd. 5. Evidence. In disciplinary actions alleging a violation of subdivision 1, clause (3)
or (4), a copy of the judgment or proceeding under the seal of the court administrator or of
the administrative agency which entered it shall be admissible into evidence without further
authentication and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the contents thereof.
    Subd. 6. Mental examination; access to medical data. (a) If the board has probable cause to
believe that a physician assistant comes under subdivision 1, clause (1), it may direct the physician
assistant to submit to a mental or physical examination. For the purpose of this subdivision, every
                    r­
physician assistant ­eg i­­e

                              ­ licensed under this chapter is deemed to have consented to submit to
a mental or physical examination when directed in writing by the board and further to have waived
all objections to the admissibility of the examining physicians' testimony or examination reports
on the ground that the same constitute a privileged communication. Failure of a physician assistant
to submit to an examination when directed constitutes an admission of the allegations against the
physician assistant, unless the failure was due to circumstance beyond the physician assistant's
control, in which case a default and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or
presentation of evidence. A physician assistant affected under this subdivision shall at reasonable
intervals be given an opportunity to demonstrate that the physician assistant can resume competent
practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients. In any proceeding under this subdivision, neither
the record of proceedings nor the orders entered by the board shall be used against a physician
assistant in any other proceeding.
    (b) In addition to ordering a physical or mental examination, the board may, notwithstanding
sections 13.384, 144.651, or any other law limiting access to medical or other health data, obtain
medical data and health records relating to a ­r­

licensee's or applicant's consent if the board has probable cause to believe that a physician assistant
comes under subdivision 1, clause (1).
    The medical data may be requested from a provider, as defined in section 144.291, subdivision 2,
paragraph (h), an insurance company, or a government agency, including the Department of Human
Services. A provider, insurance company, or government agency shall comply with any written
request of the board under this subdivision and is not liable in any action for damages for releasing
the data requested by the board if the data are released pursuant to a written request under this
subdivision, unless the information is false and the provider giving the information knew, or had
reason to believe, the information was false. Information obtained under this subdivision is classified
as private under chapter 13.
    Subd. 7. Tax clearance certificate. (a) In addition to the provisions of subdivision 1, the board

   (b) The dental hygiene services authorized to be performed by a dental hygienist under this
subdivision are limited to:
     (1) oral health promotion and disease prevention education;
     (2) removal of deposits and stains from the surfaces of the teeth;
   (3) application of topical preventive or prophylactic agents, including fluoride varnishes and pit
and fissure sealants;

     (7) taking of radiographs; and
     (8) performance of scaling and root planing.
The dental hygienist may administer injections of local anesthetic agents or nitrous oxide inhalation
analgesia as specifically delegated in the collaborative agreement with a licensed dentist. The
dentist need not first examine the patient or be present. If the patient is considered medically
compromised, the collaborative dentist shall review the patient record, including the medical
history, prior to the provision of these services. Collaborating dental hygienists may work with

care facility, program, or nonprofit organization as authorized under this subdivision is limited to
patients, students, and residents of the facility, program, or organization.
   (c) A collaborating dentist must be licensed under this chapter and may enter into a collaborative
agreement with no more than four dental hygienists unless otherwise authorized by the board. The
board shall develop parameters and a process for obtaining authorization to collaborate with more
than four dental hygienists. The collaborative agreement must include:
   (1) consideration for medically compromised patients and medical conditions for which a dental
evaluation and treatment plan must occur prior to the provision of dental hygiene services;
   (2) age- and procedure-specific standard collaborative practice protocols, including
recommended intervals for the performance of dental hygiene services and a period of time in
which an examination by a dentist should occur;
     (3) copies of consent to treatment form provided to the patient by the dental hygienist;
    (4) specific protocols for the placement of pit and fissure sealants and requirements for follow-up
care to assure the efficacy of the sealants after application; and

the dental hygienist. This procedure must specify where these records are to be located.
The collaborative agreement must be signed and maintained by the dentist, the dental hygienist, and
the facility, program, or organization; must be reviewed annually by the collaborating dentist and
dental hygienist; and must be made available to the board upon request.
    (d) Before performing any services authorized under this subdivision, a dental hygienist must
provide the patient with a consent to treatment form which must include a statement advising
the patient that the dental hygiene services provided are not a substitute for a dental examination
by a licensed dentist. If the dental hygienist makes any referrals to the patient for further dental
procedures, the dental hygienist must fill out a referral form and provide a copy of the form to the
collaborating dentist.
    (e) For the purposes of this subdivision, a "health care facility, program, or nonprofit
organization" is limited to a hospital; nursing home; home health agency; group home serving
the elderly, disabled, or juveniles; state-operated facility licensed by the commissioner of human
services or the commissioner of corrections; and federal, state, or local public health facility,
community clinic, tribal clinic, school authority, Head Start program, or nonprofit organization that
serves individuals who are uninsured or who are Minnesota health care public program recipients.
     (f) For purposes of this subdivision, a "collaborative agreement" means a written agreement with
a licensed dentist who authorizes and accepts responsibility for the services performed by the dental
hygienist. The services authorized under this subdivision and the collaborative agreement may be
performed without the presence of a licensed dentist and may be performed at a location other than
the usual place of practice of the dentist or dental hygienist and without a dentist's diagnosis and
treatment plan, unless specified in the collaborative agreement.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 150A.10, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Dental assistants. Every licensed dentist who uses the services of any unlicensed
person for the purpose of assistance in the practice of dentistry shall be responsible for the acts of
such unlicensed person while engaged in such assistance. Such dentist shall permit such unlicensed
assistant to perform only those acts which are authorized to be delegated to unlicensed assistants by
the Board of Dentistry. Such acts shall be performed under supervision of a licensed dentist. The
board may permit differing levels of dental assistance based upon recognized educational standards,
approved by the board, for the training of dental assistants. The board may also define by rule the

board shall be deemed to be enabling an unlicensed person to practice dentistry, and commission of
such an act by such unlicensed assistant shall constitute a violation of sections 150A.01 to 150A.12.
