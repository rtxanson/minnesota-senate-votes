than the state dislocated worker program.
    (c) Following the initial allocation, the board may consider additional allocations to provide
services to individual dislocated workers. The board's decision to allocate additional funds shall be
based on relevant economic indicators including: the number of substantial layoffs to date, notices of
substantial layoffs for the remainder of the fiscal year, evidence of declining industries, the number
of permanently separated individuals applying for unemployment benefits by workforce service
area, and the number of individuals exhausting unemployment benefits by workforce service area.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.148, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Computation. To defray the costs of administering sections 326B.101 to
326B.194, a surcharge is imposed on all permits issued by municipalities in connection with the
construction of or addition or alteration to buildings and equipment or appurtenances after June
30, 1971. The commissioner may use any surplus in surcharge receipts to award grants for code
research and development and education.
    If the fee for the permit issued is fixed in amount the surcharge is equivalent to one-half mill
(.0005) of the fee or 50 cents, except that effective July 1, 2010, until June 30, 2011, the permit
surcharge is equivalent to one-half mill (.0005) of the fee or $5, whichever amount is greater. For
all other permits, the surcharge is as follows:
   (1) if the valuation of the structure, addition, or alteration is $1,000,000 or less, the surcharge is
equivalent to one-half mill (.0005) of the valuation of the structure, addition, or alteration;
    (2) if the valuation is greater than $1,000,000, the surcharge is $500 plus two-fifths mill (.0004)
of the value between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000;
    (3) if the valuation is greater than $2,000,000, the surcharge is $900 plus three-tenths mill (.0003)
of the value between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000;
    (4) if the valuation is greater than $3,000,000, the surcharge is $1,200 plus one-fifth mill (.0002)
of the value between $3,000,000 and $4,000,000;
    (5) if the valuation is greater than $4,000,000, the surcharge is $1,400 plus one-tenth mill (.0001)
of the value between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000; and
    (6) if the valuation exceeds $5,000,000, the surcharge is $1,500 plus one-twentieth mill (.00005)
of the value that exceeds $5,000,000.

$38,000,000 the first year is from the fiscal
stabilization account in the federal fund. This
is a onetime appropriation.
The general fund base for this program shall
be $326,085,000 in fiscal year 2012 and
$330,430,000 in fiscal year 2013.
(a) Treatment Alternatives; Report. By
December 15, 2009, the commissioner must
submit an electronic report to the chairs
and ranking minority members of the house
of representatives and senate committees
with jurisdiction over public safety policy
and finance concerning alternative chemical
dependency treatment opportunities. The
report must identify alternatives that represent
best practices in chemical dependency
treatment of offenders. The report must
contain suggestions for reducing the length
of time between offender commitment to the
custody of the commissioner and graduation
from chemical dependency treatment. To
the extent possible, the report shall identify
options that will (1) reduce the cost of
treatment; (2) expand the number of treatment
beds; (3) improve treatment outcomes; and
(4) lower the rate of substance abuse relapse
and criminal recidivism.
(b) Challenge Incarceration; Maximum
Occupancy. The commissioner shall work to
fill all available challenge incarceration beds
82ND DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 29, 2010   9213

for both male and female offenders. If the
commissioner fails to fill at least 90 percent
of the available challenge incarceration beds
by December 1, 2009, the commissioner
must submit a report to the chairs and
ranking minority members of the house of
representatives and senate committees with
jurisdiction over public safety policy and
finance by January 15, 2010, explaining what
steps the commissioner has taken to fill the
beds and why those steps failed to reach the
goal established by the legislature.
(c)     Institutional   Efficiencies.    The
commissioner shall strive for institutional
efficiencies and must reduce the fiscal year
2008 average adult facility per diem of
$89.77 by one percent. The base is cut by
$2,850,000 in the first year and $2,850,000
in the second year to reflect a one percent
reduction in the projected adult facility per
diem. In reducing the projected adult facility
per diem, the commissioner must consider
the following:
(1) cooperating with the state of Wisconsin to
obtain economies of scale;
(2) increasing the bed capacity of the
challenge incarceration program;
(3) increasing the number of nonviolent drug
offenders who are granted conditional release
under Minnesota Statutes, section 244.055;
(4) increasing the use of compassionate
release or less costly detention alternatives
for elderly and infirm offenders;
(5) discontinuing the department's practice
of annually assigning a warden to serve as
a legislative liaison during the legislative
session;
(6) consolidating staff from correctional
institutions in geographical proximity to each
other to achieve efficiencies and cost savings,
including wardens, deputy wardens, and
human resources, technology, and employee
development personnel;

(7) consolidating the department's human
resources, technology, and employee
development functions in a centralized
location;
(8) implementing corrections best practices;
and
(9) implementing cost-saving measures used
by other states and the federal government.
The commissioner must not eliminate
correctional officer positions or implement
any other measure that will jeopardize public
safety to achieve the mandated cost savings.

(d) Per Diem Reduction. If the
commissioner fails to reduce the per diem by
one percent, the commissioner must:
(1) reduce the funding for operations support
by the amount of unrealized savings; and
(2) submit a report by February 15, 2010,
to the chairs and ranking minority members
of the house of representatives and senate
committees with jurisdiction over public
safety policy and finance that contains
descriptions of what efforts the commissioner
made to reduce the per diem, explanations
for why those steps failed to reduce the per
diem by one percent, proposed legislative
options that would assist the commissioner
in reducing the adult facility per diem,
and descriptions of the specific actions the
commissioner took to reduce funding in
operations support.
If the commissioner reduces the per diem
by more than one percent, the commissioner
must use the savings to provide treatment to
offenders.

governor and is the apparent successful candidate for the office of governor following a general
election.
      (b) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of the Department of Management and Budget.
    Subd. 2. Transition expenses. In the fiscal year of a gubernatorial election and subject to
availability of funds, the commissioner shall transfer up to $162,000 from the general contingent
account in the general fund to the Department of Management and Budget. This transfer is subject
to the review and advice of the Legislative Advisory Commission pursuant to section 3.30. In
consultation with the governor-elect, the commissioner shall use the transferred funds to pay
expenses of the governor-elect associated with preparing for the assumption of official duties as
governor. The commissioner may use the transferred funds for expenses necessary and prudent
for establishment of a transition office prior to the election and for dissolution of the office if the
incumbent governor is reelected or after the inauguration of a new governor. Expenses of the
governor-elect may include suitable office space and equipment, communications and technology
support, consulting services, compensation and travel costs, and other reasonable expenses.
Compensation rates for temporary employees hired to support the governor-elect and rates paid for
consulting services for the governor-elect shall be determined by the governor-elect.
    Subd. 3. Unused funds. No new obligations shall be incurred for expenses of the governor-elect
after the date of the inauguration. By March 31 of the year of the inauguration, the commissioner
shall return to the general contingent account any funds transferred under this section that the
commissioner determines are not needed to pay expenses of the governor-elect.

   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 471.6175, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Account maintenance. (a) A political subdivision or other public entity may establish
a trust account to be held under the supervision of the trust administrator for the purposes of this
section. A trust administrator shall establish a separate account for each participating political
subdivision or public entity. The trust administrator may charge participating political subdivisions
and public entities fees for reasonable administrative costs. The amount of any fees charged
by the Public Employees Retirement Association is appropriated to the association from the
account. A trust administrator may establish other reasonable terms and conditions for creation and
maintenance of these accounts.
   (b) The trust administrator must report to the political subdivision or other public entity on the
investment returns of invested trust assets and on all investment fees or costs incurred by the trust.
The annual rates of return, along with investment and administrative fees and costs for the trust,
must be disclosed in the political subdivision's or public entity's annual financial audit in a manner
prescribed by the state auditor.

   Sec. 31. ADDITIONAL OPERATING BUDGET REDUCTIONS.
    By July 30, 2010, the commissioner of management and budget must allocate a reduction of
$3,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, to the operating budgets of executive branch
state agencies, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.011, subdivision 12a. To the extent
possible, this reduction must be achieved through estimated savings in expenditures for space,
out-of-state travel, fleet management, energy usage in state buildings, contracts for professional
or technical services, and through increased employee telecommuting, and through consolidation
of information technology functions, or through other operational efficiencies. If expenditure
reductions are achieved in dedicated funds other than those established in the state constitution or
protected by federal law, the commissioner of management and budget may transfer the amount
of the savings to the general fund. Executive branch state agencies must cooperate with the
commissioner of management and budget in developing and implementing these reductions. Any
amount of the reduction that cannot be achieved through savings in the expenditure types described
in this section must be allocated to executive state agency operating budgets by the commissioner.
Reductions in fiscal year 2011 must cancel to the general fund and shall be reflected as reductions
in agency base budgets for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The commissioner of management and
budget must report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate Finance Committee
and the house of representatives Ways and Means and Finance Committees regarding the amount
of reductions in spending by each agency under this section.
   Sec. 32. HELP AMERICA VOTE ACT.
   (a) If the secretary of state determines that this state is otherwise eligible to receive an additional
payment of federal money under the Help America Vote Act, Public Law 107-252, the secretary
must certify to the commissioner of management and budget the amount, if any, needed to meet the
matching requirement of section 253(b)(5) of the Help America Vote Act. In the certification, the

secretary shall specify the portion of the match that should be taken from an unencumbered general
fund appropriation to the Office of the Secretary of State not designated for a different purpose. Upon
receipt of that certification, or as soon as an unencumbered general fund appropriation becomes
available, whichever occurs later, the commissioner must transfer the specified amount to the Help
America Vote Act account.
   (b) This section expires on June 30, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 273.111, subdivision 9, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), when real property which is
being, or has been valued and assessed under this section no longer qualifies under subdivision
3, the portion no longer qualifying shall be subject to additional taxes, in the amount equal to
the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 4, and the amount
determined under subdivision 5. Provided, however, that the amount determined under subdivision
5 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property
at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision
5. Such additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the current year,
provided, however, that no interest or penalties shall be levied on such additional taxes if timely
paid, and provided further, that such additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the last
three years that the said property has been valued and assessed under this section.
    (b) Real property that has been valued and assessed under this section prior to May 29, 2008,
and that ceases to qualify under this section after May 28, 2008, and is withdrawn from the program

subdivision 3, paragraph (c). If additional taxes have been paid under this subdivision with respect
to property described in this paragraph prior to April 3, 2009, the county must repay the property
owner in the manner prescribed by the commissioner of revenue.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for withdrawals after April 30, 2010.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.1384, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Credit reduction. In 2011 and each year thereafter, the market value credit
reimbursement amount for each taxing jurisdiction determined under this section is reduced by the
dollar amount of the reduction in market value credit reimbursements for that taxing jurisdiction in
2010 due to unallotment reductions announced prior to February 28, 2010, under section 16A.152.
No taxing jurisdiction's market value credit reimbursements are reduced to less than zero under this
subdivision. The commissioner of revenue shall pay the annual market value credit reimbursement
amounts, after reduction under this subdivision, to the affected taxing jurisdictions as provided in
this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2011 and thereafter.

If the county utilizes this special levy, except to pay operating or maintenance costs of a new regional
jail facility under sections 641.262 to 641.264 which will not replace an existing jail facility, any
amount levied by the county in the previous levy year for the purposes specified under this clause
and included in the county's previous year's levy limitation computed under section 275.71, shall
be deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71, subdivision 2, when determining the

subdivision 2, when determining the county's current year levy limitation. The county shall provide
the necessary information to the commissioner of revenue for making this determination;

    (14) to pay for court administration costs as required under section 273.1398, subdivision 4b,
less the (i) county's share of transferred fines and fees collected by the district courts in the county
for calendar year 2001 and (ii) the aid amount certified to be paid to the county in 2004 under section
273.1398, subdivision 4c; however, for taxes levied to pay for these costs in the year in which the
court financing is transferred to the state, the amount under this clause is limited to the amount of
aid the county is certified to receive under section 273.1398, subdivision 4a;
    (15) to fund a police or firefighters relief association as required under section 69.77 to the extent

the previous levy year for the purposes specified in this clause and included in the city's or county's
previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be deducted from the levy limit base
under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or county's current year levy limit;
    (18) for counties, to pay for the increase in their share of health and human service costs caused

   (19) for a city, for the costs reasonably and necessarily incurred for securing, maintaining, or
demolishing foreclosed or abandoned residential properties, as allowed by the commissioner of
revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2. A city must have either (i) a foreclosure rate of at least

is at least 50 percent higher than the average foreclosure rate in the metropolitan area, as defined in

this clause in the previous year;
    (22) an amount equal to any reductions in the certified aids or credits payable under sections
477A.011 to 477A.014, and section 273.1384, due to unallotment under section 16A.152 or
reductions under another provision of law. The amount of the levy allowed under this clause is
equal to the amount unallotted or reduced in the calendar year in which the tax is levied unless
the unallotment or reduction amount is not known by September 1 of the levy year, and the local
government has not adjusted its levy under section 275.065, subdivision 6, or 275.07, subdivision
6, in which case the unallotment or reduction amount may be levied in the following year;
    (23) to pay for the difference between one-half of the costs of confining sex offenders undergoing
the civil commitment process and any state payments for this purpose pursuant to section 253B.185,

or other public safety facilities and for which all or a portion of the funding for the site acquisition,
building design, site preparation, construction, and related equipment was issued or authorized prior
to the imposition of levy limits in 2008. The levy limit base shall then be increased by an amount
equal to the new facility's first full year's operating costs as described in this clause; and

in 2010 under this section minus the amount of its aid reduction under section 477A.0133. For aids
payable in 2012 and thereafter, the total aid in the previous year for any city means the amount of
aid it was certified to receive under this section in the previous payable year.
    (c) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for any city shall not exceed the sum of
(1) ten percent of the city's net levy for the year prior to the aid distribution plus (2) its total aid in
the previous year. For aids payable in 2009 and thereafter, the total aid for any city with a population
of 2,500 or more may not be less than its total aid under this section in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.
    (d) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for a city with a population less than
2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids
payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than
what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year 2008 was
aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2011 and
thereafter.

82ND DAY]                                   MONDAY, MARCH 29, 2010                                                         9235

   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the
meanings given them in this subdivision.
    (b) The "2010 revenue base" for a county is the sum of the county's certified property tax levy
for taxes payable in 2010, plus the amount of county program aid under section 477A.0124 that the
county was certified to receive in 2010, plus the amount of taconite aids under sections 298.28 and
298.282 that the county was certified to receive in 2010 including any amounts required to be placed
in a special fund for distribution in a later year.
    (c) The "2010 revenue base" for a statutory or home rule charter city is the sum of the city's
certified property tax levy for taxes payable in 2010, plus the amount of local government aid under
section 477A.013, subdivision 9, that the city was certified to receive in 2010, plus the amount
of taconite aids under sections 298.28 and 298.282 that the city was certified to receive in 2010
including any amounts required to be placed in a special fund for distribution in a later year.
    Subd. 2. 2010 reductions; counties and cities. The commissioner of revenue must compute
additional 2010 aid and credit reimbursement reduction amounts for each county and city under
this section, after implementing any reduction of county program aid under section 477A.0124,
local government aid under section 477A.013, or market value credit reimbursements under section
273.1384, to reflect the reduction of allotments under section 16A.152.
   The additional reduction amounts under this section are limited to the sum of the amount of
county program aid under section 477A.0124, local government aid under section 477A.013, and
market value credit reimbursements under section 273.1384 payable to the county or city in 2010
before the reductions in this section, but after the reductions for unallotments.
    The reduction amount under this section is applied first to reduce the amount payable to the
county or city in 2010 as market value credit reimbursements under section 273.1384, and then if
necessary, to reduce the amount payable as either county program aid under section 477A.0124 in
the case of a county, or local government aid under section 477A.013 in the case of a city.
    No aid or reimbursement amount is reduced to less than zero under this section.
   The additional 2010 aid reduction amount for a county is equal to 1.82767 percent of the county's
2010 revenue base. The additional 2010 aid reduction amount for a city is equal to the lesser of (1)
3.4287 percent of the city's 2010 revenue base or (2) $28 multiplied by the city's 2008 population.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
