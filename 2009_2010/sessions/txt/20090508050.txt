                   EXECUTIVE AND OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS

                                                                                     May 7, 2009
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 39, Senate File 2081, the Jobs and Economic
Development Finance Omnibus Bill.
4238                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [50TH DAY

    While the majority of the bill is acceptable to me and serves the purpose of advancing such key
goals as economic development and job training, a few provisions are so misguided they necessitate
a veto. Since these items are not subject to line-item veto, inclusion in the bill triggered a veto of
the entire bill.
    As indicated previously, the provision in the bill that forgives a loan payment by the city of Saint
Paul to the state of Minnesota for the Saint Paul RiverCentre is problematic. The city of Saint Paul
should not threaten to reduce police and fire services while requesting that a loan be forgiven in
order to build an ice rink. In light of the Legislature's apparent strong desire to forgive this debt, I
suggested a compromise that would direct some or all of the loan forgiveness funds to the higher
priority purpose of police and fire services. That suggestion was ignored.
    The bill also includes a repealer on line 147.23 allowing non-registered practitioners of
alternative medicine to be compensated for services provided to injured workers through the
workers' compensation system. Minnesota has a tradition and practice of vetting proposed changes
to our workers' compensation laws through the Workers' Compensation Advisory Council. The
Council did not approve this change.
    I also refer you to my letter to Senator Tomassoni and Representative Rukavina dated April
30, 2009. It outlines my concerns regarding legislative initiatives considered by the conference
committee.
    I commend the Legislature for its work to fund many other important programs in this bill, and
believe we can come to an acceptable compromise. My Administration stands ready to work with
you to achieve that goal.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2081 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE

appointment, and other information required by the Supreme Court. Registration data that the

administrator shall require a professional guardian or conservator to pay a registration fee and may
require other guardians and conservators to pay a fee. The state court administrator shall begin
collecting fees under this section on July 1, 2012. Fees collected by the state court administrator
under this section are appropriated to the Supreme Court.
   Sec. 4. [524.5-120] BILL OF RIGHTS FOR WARDS AND PROTECTED PERSONS.

be enforced by the court. These rights include the right to:

      524.5-301 APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF GUARDIAN.
   Subdivision 1. General. A person becomes a guardian of an incapacitated person by a parental or
spousal appointment or upon appointment by the court. The guardianship continues until terminated,
without regard to the location of the guardian or ward.

    (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to a professional guardian that is a nonprofit organization that
provides guardianship services or to an employee or other person acting under the supervision of

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-304, is amended to read:
  524.5-304 JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIAN: PRELIMINARIES TO
HEARING.
    (a) Upon receipt of a petition to establish a guardianship, the court shall set a date and time for
hearing the petition and may appoint a visitor. The duties and reporting requirements of the visitor
are limited to the relief requested in the petition.
    (b) A proposed ward has the right to be represented by counsel at any proceeding under this
article. The court shall appoint counsel to represent the proposed ward for the initial proceeding
held pursuant to section 524.5-307 if neither the proposed ward nor others provide counsel unless
in a meeting with a visitor the proposed ward makes an informed decision in writing to specifically
w
­­a­v
   i­­e­
       s waive the right to counsel. Before appointment, and at any time during the course of the
representation when a risk of a conflict of interest may arise, the proposed or appointed counsel shall
disclose to the court, the proposed ward or ward, and interested persons whether there are concurrent
proceedings in which the counsel is the attorney for the proposed guardian or guardian and whether
there is a risk of a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct so that
the representation of the proposed ward or ward will be materially limited by counsel's concurrent
responsibilities to the proposed guardian or guardian. If there is a risk of a conflict of interest, the
counsel must not be appointed or new counsel must be appointed, unless:
    (1) the court determines that the proposed ward or ward is able to give informed consent to
the representation and, if the proposed ward or ward consents, the consent is confirmed in writing
pursuant to Rule 1.7; or
      (2) the court determines that there is not a risk of a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7 requiring
4242                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [50TH DAY

the appointment of different counsel.
    Counsel must be appointed immediately after any petition under this article is served under
section 524.5-308. Counsel has the full right of subpoena. In all proceedings under this article,
counsel shall:
   (1) consult with the proposed ward before any hearing;
   (2) be given adequate time to prepare for all hearings; and
   (3) continue to represent the person throughout any proceedings under section 524.5-307,
provided that such appointment shall expire upon the expiration of the appeal time for the order
appointing guardian or the order dismissing a petition, or upon such other time or event as the
court may direct.
    The court need not appoint counsel to represent the proposed ward on a voluntary petition, and
the court may remove a court-appointed attorney at any time if the court finds that the proposed ward
has made a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel or has obtained private counsel.
    (c) The visitor shall personally serve the notice and petition upon the respondent and shall offer
to read the notice and petition to the respondent, and if so requested the visitor shall read the notice
and petition to such person. The visitor shall also interview the respondent in person, and to the
extent that the respondent is able to understand:
   (1) explain to the respondent the substance of the petition; the nature, purpose, and effect of the
proceeding; the respondent's rights at the hearing; and the general powers and duties of a guardian;
   (2) determine the respondent's views about the proposed guardian, the proposed guardian's
powers and duties, and the scope and duration of the proposed guardianship;
  (3) inform the respondent of the right to employ and consult with a lawyer at the respondent's
own expense and the right to request a court-appointed lawyer; and
    (4) inform the respondent that all costs and expenses of the proceeding, including respondent's
attorneys fees, will be paid from the respondent's estate.
   (d) In addition to the duties in paragraph (c), the visitor shall make any other investigation the
court directs.
   (e) The visitor shall promptly file a report in writing with the court, which must include:
    (1) recommendations regarding the appropriateness of guardianship, including whether
less restrictive means of intervention are available, the type of guardianship, and, if a limited
guardianship, the powers to be granted to the limited guardian;
   (2) a statement as to whether the respondent approves or disapproves of the proposed guardian,
and the powers and duties proposed or the scope of the guardianship; and
   (3) any other matters the court directs.
   (f) The county social service agency may create a screening committee to review a petition
involving an indigent person. The screening committee must consist of individuals selected by the
agency with knowledge of alternatives that are less restrictive than guardianship. If the agency has
50TH DAY]                              FRIDAY, MAY 8, 2009                                        4243

created a screening committee, the court shall make its decision after the screening committee has
reviewed the petition. For an indigent person, the court may appoint a guardian under contract with
the county to provide these services.
   (g) Before the initial appointment, and annually within 30 days after the anniversary date of the
appointment, the proposed guardian or guardian shall file an informational statement with the court.
The statement must be a sworn affidavit containing the following information:
   (1) the person's educational background and relevant work and other experience;
   (2) the person's addresses and telephone numbers, including places of business or residence
where the guardian can be contacted;
   (3) whether the person has ever been removed for cause from serving as a guardian or conservator
and if so, the case number and court location;
    (4) any changes occurring that would affect the accuracy of information contained in the most
recent criminal background study conducted pursuant to section 524.5-118; and
   (5) if applicable, the amount of reimbursement for services rendered to the ward that the person
has received during the previous year.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-309, is amended to read:
   524.5-309 WHO MAY BE GUARDIAN: PRIORITIES.
   (a) Subject to paragraph (c), the court, in appointing a guardian, shall consider persons otherwise
qualified in the following order of priority:
    (1) a guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian, currently acting for the respondent
in this state or elsewhere;
   (2) an agent appointed by the respondent under a health care directive pursuant to chapter 145C;
    (3) the spouse of the respondent or a person nominated by will or other signed writing executed
in the same manner as a health care directive pursuant to chapter 145C of a deceased spouse;
   (4) an adult child of the respondent;
   (5) a parent of the respondent, or an individual nominated by will or other signed writing
executed in the same manner as a health care directive pursuant to chapter 145C of a deceased
parent; ­
        an
         ­d
          ­
    (6) an adult with whom the respondent has resided for more than six months before the filing of
the petition;
   (7) an adult who is related to the respondent by blood, adoption, or marriage; and
   (8) any other adult or a professional guardian.
    (b) The court, acting in the best interest of the respondent, may decline to appoint a person having
priority and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority. With respect to persons having
equal priority, the court shall select the one it considers best qualified.

   (c) Any individual or agency which provides residence, custodial care, medical care,
employment training or other care or services for which they receive a fee may not be appointed as
guardian unless related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-310, is amended to read:
    524.5-310 FINDINGS; ORDER OF APPOINTMENT.
    (a) The court may appoint a limited or unlimited guardian for a respondent only if it finds by
clear and convincing evidence that:
    (1) the respondent is an incapacitated person; and
   (2) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by less restrictive means, including use of
appropriate technological assistance.
   (b) Alternatively, the court, with appropriate findings, may treat the petition as one for
a protective order under section 524.5-401, enter any other appropriate order, or dismiss the
proceeding.
    (c) The court shall grant to a guardian only those powers necessitated by the ward's limitations
and demonstrated needs and, whenever feasible, make appointive and other orders that will
encourage the development of the ward's maximum self-reliance and independence. Any power
not specifically granted to the guardian, following a written finding by the court of a demonstrated
need for that power, is retained by the ward.
    (d) Within 14 days after an appointment, a guardian shall send or deliver to the ward, and counsel
if represented at the hearing, a copy of the order of appointment accompanied by a notice which
advises the ward of the right to appeal the guardianship appointment in the time and manner provided
by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.
    (e) Each year, within 30 days after the anniversary date of an appointment, a guardian shall send
or deliver to the ward and to interested persons of record with the court a notice of the right to request
termination or modification of the guardianship or to request an order that is in the best interests of
the ward or for other appropriate relief, and notice of the status of the ward's right to vote.
    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-315, is amended to read:
    524.5-315 RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES OF GUARDIAN; LIMITATIONS.
    (a) A guardian is entitled to reasonable compensation for services as guardian and to
reimbursement for expenditures made on behalf of the ward, in a manner consistent with section
524.5-502.
    (b) A guardian is not liable to a third person for acts of the ward solely by reason of the
relationship. A guardian who exercises reasonable care in choosing a third person providing
medical or other care, treatment, or service for the ward is not liable for injury to the ward resulting
from the wrongful conduct of the third person.
    (c) A guardian,­­w

   524.5-316 REPORTS; MONITORING OF GUARDIANSHIP; COURT ORDERS.
    (a) A guardian shall report to the court in writing on the condition of the ward at least annually
and whenever ordered by the court. A copy of the report must be provided to the ward and to
interested persons of record with the court. A report must state or contain:
   (1) the current mental, physical, and social condition of the ward;
   (2) the living arrangements for all addresses of the ward during the reporting period;
    (3) any restrictions placed on the ward's right to communication and visitation with persons of
the ward's choice and the factual bases for those restrictions;
   ­
   (3
    ­­)(4) the medical, educational, vocational, and other services provided to the ward and the
guardian's opinion as to the adequacy of the ward's care; and
   ­
   (4
    ­­)(5) a recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and any recommended
changes in the scope of the guardianship.
    (b) A ward or interested person of record with the court may submit to the court a written

in the report and may petition the court for an order that is in the best interests of the ward or for
other appropriate relief.

any other investigation the court directs.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-317, is amended to read:
  524.5-317 TERMINATION OR MODIFICATION OF GUARDIANSHIP; COURT
ORDERS.
   (a) A guardianship terminates upon the death of the ward or upon order of the court.
    (b) On petition of any person interested in the ward's welfare the court may terminate a
guardianship if the ward no longer needs the assistance or protection of a guardian. The court may
modify the type of appointment or powers granted to the guardian if the extent of protection or
assistance previously granted is currently excessive or insufficient or the ward's capacity to provide
for support, care, education, health, and welfare has so changed as to warrant that action. The court
may make any other order that is in the best interests of the ward or may grant other appropriate
relief.

    (c) Except as otherwise ordered by the court for good cause, the court, before terminating a
guardianship, shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward as apply to a
petition for guardianship. Upon presentation by the petitioner of evidence establishing a prima facie
case for termination, the court shall order the termination and discharge the guardian unless it is
proven that continuation of the guardianship is in the best interest of the ward.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-406, is amended to read:
  524.5-406 ORIGINAL PETITION: PERSONS UNDER DISABILITY; PRELIMINARIES
TO HEARING.
    (a) Upon the filing of a petition for a conservatorship or other protective order for a respondent
for reasons other than being a minor, the court shall set a date for hearing and the court may appoint
a visitor. The duties and reporting requirements of the visitor are limited to the relief requested in
the petition.
    (b) A respondent has the right to be represented by counsel at any proceeding under this article.
The court shall appoint counsel to represent the respondent for the initial proceeding held pursuant
to section 524.5-408 if neither the respondent nor others provide counsel, unless in a meeting with a
visitor, the proposed respondent makes an informed decision in writing to specifically w   ­­
                                                                                            a­v

the right to counsel. Before appointment, and at any time during the course of the representation
when a risk of a conflict of interest may arise, the proposed or appointed counsel shall disclose
to the court, the proposed protected person or protected person, and interested persons whether
there are concurrent proceedings in which the counsel is the attorney for the proposed conservator
or conservator and whether there is a risk of a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7 of the Rules of
Professional Conduct so that the representation of the proposed protected person or protected person
will be materially limited by counsel's concurrent responsibilities to the proposed conservator or
conservator. If there is a risk of a conflict of interest, the counsel must not be appointed, unless:
    (1) the court determines that the proposed protected person or protected person is able to give
informed consent to the representation and, if the proposed protected person or protected person
consents, the consent is confirmed in writing pursuant to Rule 1.7; or
    (2) the court determines that there is not a risk of a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7 requiring
the appointment of different counsel.
    Counsel must be appointed immediately after any petition under this part is served pursuant to
section 524.5-404. Counsel has the full right of subpoena. In all proceedings under this part, counsel
shall:
   (1) consult with the respondent before any hearing;
   (2) be given adequate time to prepare for all hearings; and
   (3) continue to represent the respondent throughout any proceedings under section 524.5-408,
provided that such appointment shall expire upon the expiration of the appeal time for the order
appointing conservator or the order dismissing a petition, or upon such other time or event as the
court may direct.
   The court need not appoint counsel to represent the respondent on a voluntary petition, and the
court may remove a court-appointed attorney at any time if the court finds that the respondent has

made a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel or has obtained private counsel.
    (c) The visitor shall personally serve the notice and petition upon the respondent and shall offer
to read the notice and petition to the respondent, and if so requested, the visitor shall read the notice
and petition to such person. The visitor shall also interview the respondent in person, and to the
extent that the respondent is able to understand:
    (1) explain to the respondent the substance of the petition and the nature, purpose, and effect of
the proceeding;
   (2) if the appointment of a conservator is requested, inform the respondent of the general
powers and duties of a conservator and determine the respondent's views regarding the proposed
conservator, the proposed conservator's powers and duties, and the scope and duration of the
proposed conservatorship;
    (3) inform the respondent of the respondent's rights, including the right to employ and consult
with a lawyer at the respondent's own expense, and the right to request a court-appointed lawyer;
and
    (4) inform the respondent that all costs and expenses of the proceeding, including respondent's
attorney fees, will be paid from the respondent's estate.
    (d) In addition to the duties set out in paragraph (c), the visitor shall make any other investigations
the court directs.
   (e) The visitor shall promptly file a report with the court which must include:
    (1) recommendations regarding the appropriateness of a conservatorship, including whether
less restrictive means of intervention are available, the type of conservatorship, and, if a limited
conservatorship, the powers and duties to be granted the limited conservator, and the assets over
which the conservator should be granted authority;
   (2) a statement as to whether the respondent approves or disapproves of the proposed
conservator, and the powers and duties proposed or the scope of the conservatorship; and
   (3) any other matters the court directs.
    (f) While a petition to establish a conservatorship or for another protective order is pending, after
preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court may make orders to preserve and apply
the property of the respondent as may be required for the support of the respondent or individuals
who are in fact dependent upon the respondent, and may appoint an agent to assist in that task.
   (g) Before the initial appointment, and annually within 30 days after the anniversary date of the
appointment, the proposed conservator or conservator shall file an informational statement with the
court. The statement must be a sworn affidavit containing the following information:
   (1) the person's educational background and relevant work and other experience;
   (2) the person's addresses and telephone numbers, including places of business or residence
where the conservator can be contacted;
   (3) whether the person has ever been removed for cause from serving as a guardian or conservator

and if so, the case number and court location;
    (4) any changes occurring that would affect the accuracy of information contained in the most
recent criminal background study conducted pursuant to section 524.5-118; and
    (5) if applicable, the amount of reimbursement for services rendered to the protected person that
the person has received during the previous year.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-409, is amended to read:
   524.5-409 FINDINGS; ORDER OF APPOINTMENT.
    (a) The court may appoint a limited or unlimited conservator for a respondent only if it finds
that:
    (1) by clear and convincing evidence, the individual is unable to manage property and business
affairs because of an impairment in the ability to receive and evaluate information or make decisions,
even with the use of appropriate technological assistance, or because the individual is missing,
detained, or unable to return to the United States;
   (2) by a preponderance of evidence, the individual has property that will be wasted or dissipated
unless management is provided or money is needed for the support, care, education, health, and
welfare of the individual or of individuals who are entitled to the individual's support and that
protection is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide money; and
   (3) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by less restrictive means, including use of
appropriate technological assistance.
   (b) Alternatively, the court, with appropriate findings, may enter any other appropriate order, or
dismiss the proceeding.
    (c) The court, whenever feasible, shall grant to a conservator only those powers necessitated by
the protected person's limitations and demonstrated needs and make appointive and other orders that
will encourage the development of the protected person's maximum self-reliance and independence.
    (d) Within 14 days after an appointment, the conservator shall send or deliver to the protected
person, if the protected person has attained 14 years of age and is not missing, detained, or unable
to return to the United States, and counsel if represented at the hearing, a copy of the order of
appointment accompanied by a notice which advises the protected person of the right to appeal the
conservatorship appointment in the time and manner provided by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.
    (e) Each year, within 30 days after the anniversary date of an appointment, a conservator shall
send or deliver to the protected person and to interested persons of record with the court a notice of
the right to request termination or modification of the conservatorship or for any order that is in the
best interests of the protected person or for other appropriate relief.
    (f) The appointment of a conservator or the entry of another protective order is not a
determination of incapacity of the protected person.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-413, is amended to read:
   524.5-413 WHO MAY BE CONSERVATOR; PRIORITIES.
50TH DAY]                              FRIDAY, MAY 8, 2009                                        4249

   (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d), the court, in appointing a conservator, shall
consider persons otherwise qualified in the following order of priority:
   (1) a conservator, guardian of the estate, or other like fiduciary appointed or recognized by an
appropriate court of any other jurisdiction in which the protected person resides;
    (2) a person nominated as conservator by the respondent, including the respondent's most recent
nomination made in a durable power of attorney, if the respondent has attained 14 years of age and
at the time of the nomination had sufficient capacity to express a preference;
   (3) an agent appointed by the respondent to manage the respondent's property under a durable
power of attorney;
   (4) the spouse of the respondent;
   (5) an adult child of the respondent;
   (6) a parent of the respondent; ­

                                    ­d
                                     ­
    (7) an adult with whom the respondent has resided for more than six months before the filing of
the petition;
   (8) an adult who is related to the respondent by blood, adoption, or marriage; and
   (9) any other adult or a professional conservator.
   (b) A person having priority under paragraph (a), clause (1), (4), (5), or (6), may designate in
writing a substitute to serve instead and thereby transfer the priority to the substitute.
   (c) The court, acting in the best interest of the protected person, may decline to appoint a person
having priority and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority. With respect to persons
having equal priority, the court shall select the one it considers best qualified.
    (d) In any proceeding where the value of the personal property of the estate of the proposed
protected person in the initial inventory of the estate filed by the conservator under section 524.5-419
is expected to be at least $10,000, the court shall require the conservator to post a bond and shall
require that a professional conservator must be certified within six months of the appointment. The
bond requirement under this paragraph does not apply to conservators appointed before August 1,
2009, but shall apply as current conservatorships are reviewed by the court after August 1, 2009.
Certification is not required under this paragraph if the conservator is a nonprofit organization that
provides conservatorship services or to an employee or other person acting under the supervision
of the organization, if the organization provides continuing education for persons who provide the
services.
    (e) Any individual or agency which provides residence, custodial care, medical care,
employment training, or other care or services for which they receive a fee may not be appointed
as conservator unless related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. The certification requirement under this section is effective July 1, 2010.

   (a) A protected person or an interested person may file a petition in the appointing court for an
order:
   (1) requiring bond or collateral or additional bond or collateral, or reducing bond;
   (2) requiring an accounting for the administration of the protected person's estate;
   (3) directing distribution;
   (4) removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor conservator;
   (5) modifying the type of appointment or powers granted to the conservator if the extent of
protection or management previously granted is currently excessive or insufficient or the protected
person's ability to manage the estate and business affairs has so changed as to warrant the action; or
   (6) acting in the protected person's best interests or granting other appropriate relief.
    (b) A conservator may petition the appointing court for instructions concerning fiduciary
responsibility.
   (c) On notice and hearing the petition, the court may give appropriate instructions and make any
appropriate order.
   (d) The court may, at its own discretion, waive the notice or hearing requirements for the relief
requested in a petition filed under this section.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 524.5-420, is amended to read:

ORDERS.
    (a) A conservator shall report to the court for administration of the estate annually unless the
court otherwise directs, upon resignation or removal, upon termination of the conservatorship, and
at other times as the court directs. An order, after notice and hearing, allowing an intermediate
report of a conservator adjudicates liabilities concerning the matters adequately disclosed in the
accounting. An order, after notice and hearing, allowing a final report adjudicates all previously
unsettled liabilities relating to the conservatorship.
   (b) A report must state or contain a listing of the assets of the estate under the conservator's
control and a listing of the receipts, disbursements, and distributions during the reporting period.
   (c) A protected person or an interested person of record with the court may submit to the court
a written statement disputing account statements regarding the administration of the estate that are
contained in the report and may petition the court for any order that is in the best interests of the
protected person and the estate or for other appropriate relief.
    (d) The court may appoint a visitor to review a report or plan, interview the protected person
or conservator, and make any other investigation the court directs. In connection with a report, the
court may order a conservator to submit the assets of the estate to an appropriate examination to be
made in a manner the court directs.
   ­
   (­
    d­) (e) The court shall establish a system for monitoring of conservatorships, including the filing
and review of conservators' reports and plans. If an annual report is not filed within 60 days of the

   "Sec. 10. [201.017] VOTER IDENTIFICATION CARDS.
    Subdivision 1. Access; eligibility. The county auditor must provide at least one location in the
county at which it will accept applications for and issue voter identification cards to registered
Minnesota voters. A voter identification card is valid only for purposes of voter identification under
section 204C.10, and is available only to registered Minnesota voters. No fee may be charged or
collected for the application for or issuance of a voter identification card. A voter is not eligible for
a voter identification card if the voter has a Minnesota driver's license or identification card issued
by the Department of Public Safety that is currently valid and will not expire prior to election day.
    Subd. 2. Validity. A voter identification card is valid as long as the voter resides at the address
indicated on the card and remains qualified to vote. A voter who moves to a different residence
within the state must surrender the card to the appropriate county auditor of the new residence.
After surrender of an invalid card, a voter may apply for and receive a new card if the voter is
otherwise eligible. A person who moves to a residence outside the state of Minnesota or who ceases
to be qualified to vote must surrender the voter identification card to the county auditor from which
it was issued.
  Subd. 3. Documentation required of applicant. (a) An applicant for a voter identification card
must submit the following before the county auditor may issue an identification card:
   (1) proof of the applicant's current registration to vote in the state of Minnesota;
    (2) documentation approved by the secretary of state sufficient to prove residence in Minnesota
for purposes of election day voter registration; and
    (3) official documentation that contains the applicant's name, current address of residence, and
date of birth.
   The secretary of state may adopt rules to further describe and define the types of documentation
sufficient to meet the requirements of this subdivision.
    (b) The application for a voter identification card shall elicit the information required to be
printed under subdivision 4. The application must be signed and sworn to by the applicant. An
applicant who knowingly submits an application containing false information is guilty of a felony.
    Subd. 4. Format of card. The voter identification card shall be captioned "MINNESOTA
VOTER IDENTIFICATION CARD," and contain a prominent statement that under Minnesota
law, the card is valid only as identification for voting purposes. The voter identification card must
be laminated, contain a digital color photograph of the voter, and include the following information
about the voter:
   (1) full legal name;
   (2) address of residence;
   (3) birth date;
   (4) date identification card was issued;

    Subdivision 1. Casting of provisional ballots. (a) A voter who appears at a polling place for
the purpose of casting a ballot in a primary or general election but is unable to provide proper photo
identification as required by section 204C.10 is entitled, upon swearing or affirming the voter's
identity, to cast a provisional ballot as provided by this section.
    (b) A voter seeking to vote a provisional ballot must complete a provisional ballot voting
certificate. The certificate must include information about the place, manner, and approximate date
on which the voter previously registered to vote. The voter must also swear or affirm in writing
that the voter previously registered to vote, is eligible to vote, has not voted previously in that
election, and meets the criteria for registering to vote in Minnesota. The form of the provisional
ballot voting certificate shall be prescribed by the secretary of state.
    (c) Once the voter has completed the provisional ballot voting certificate as required by this
subdivision, the voter must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. The provisional ballot must be
the same as that utilized by the county or municipality for mail-in absentee ballots. A completed
provisional ballot shall be sealed in the manner required for absentee ballots pursuant to section
203B.07, and deposited by the voter in a secure, sealed ballot box.
   Subd. 2. Counting provisional ballots. (a) The head election judge in a precinct where a
provisional vote was cast must notify the county auditor or municipal clerk of the number of
provisional ballots cast as soon as practicable following the closing of the polls. Provisional ballots
and related documentation shall be delivered to and securely maintained by the county auditor or
municipal clerk.
    (b) A voter who, because of an inability to produce photo identification on election day,
cast a provisional ballot in the polling place may personally appear before the county auditor or
municipal clerk no later than five business days following the election to determine whether the
provisional ballot will be counted. The county auditor or municipal clerk must count a provisional
ballot in the final certified results from the precinct if the voter either: (1) presents a form of photo
identification permissible under section 204C.10, subdivision 2, or the documentation necessary to
secure a Minnesota voter identification card under section 201.017, subdivision 3; or (2) executes
an affidavit before the county auditor or municipal clerk, in a form prescribed by the secretary
of state, affirming under penalty of perjury that the voter is the same person who appeared in the
polling place on election day and cast a provisional ballot and either: (i) is unable to obtain a
sufficient form of photo identification without the payment of a fee and was not able to secure a
Minnesota voter identification card prior to election day; or (ii) has a religious objection to being
photographed.
   (c) If a voter does not appear before the county auditor or municipal clerk within five business
days following the election, or otherwise does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b), the
voter's provisional ballot must not be counted.
   (d) The county auditor or municipal clerk must notify, in writing, any voter who does not appear
within five business days of the election that their provisional ballot was not cast because of the
voter's failure to provide photo identification at the polling place and the voter's failure to appear
within five business days following the election to determine whether the provisional ballot should
be counted."

Minneapolis, it must obtain permission from and is subject to reasonable limitations imposed by a
joint board consisting of one representative from the council, one member of a city council from a
city contiguous to the city of Minneapolis, two members of the board of park commissioners, and a
fifth member jointly selected by other members of the board.
    The board of park commissioners and the council may designate persons to sit on the joint
board. In considering a request by the council to use designated parkways for additional routes or
trips, the joint board consisting of the council or their designees, the board of park commissioners
or their designees, and the fifth member, shall base its decision to grant or deny the request based
on the criteria to be established by the joint board. The decision to grant or deny the request must
be made within 45 days of the date of the request. The park board must be notified immediately
by the council of any temporary route detours. If the park board objects to the temporary route
detours within five days of being notified, the joint board must convene and decide whether to grant
the request, otherwise the request is deemed granted. If the agency objects to the proposed use
or claims reimbursement from the council for additional cost of maintenance, it may commence
an action against the council in the district court of the county wherein the highway, roadway, or
appurtenance, or major portion thereof, is located. The proceedings in the action must conform to
the Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to the district courts. The court shall sit without jury. If the
court determines that the use in question interferes unreasonably with the public use or maintenance
of the roadway or appurtenance, it shall enjoin the use by the council. If the court determines that the
use in question does not interfere unreasonably with the public use or maintenance of the roadway
or appurtenance, but that it entails substantial additional maintenance costs, the court shall award
judgment to the agency for the amount of the additional costs. Otherwise the court shall award
judgment to the council. An aggrieved party may appeal from the judgment of the district court in
the same manner as is provided for such appeals in other civil actions. The council may also use
land within the right-of-way of any state highway or other public roadway for the erection of traffic
control devices, other signs, and passenger shelters upon the conditions stated in this subdivision
and subject only to the approval of the commissioner of transportation where required by statute,
and subject to the express provisions of other applicable statutes and to federal requirements where
necessary to qualify for federal aid."

rules under chapter 14 as are necessary for the administration of the Mississippi River corridor
critical area program. Duties of the Environmental Quality Council or the Environmental Quality
Board referenced in this chapter, related rules, and the governor's executive order number 79-19,
published in the State Register on March 12, 1979, that are related to the Mississippi River corridor

features with an average slope of 12 to 18 percent measured over a horizontal distance of 50 feet or
more; and
    (5) "very steep slopes" means slopes 18 percent or greater. Very steep slopes are natural
topographic features with an average slope of 18 percent or greater, measured over a horizontal
distance of 50 feet or more.

properly filled.
    (d) The determination of whether to make a grant for a qualifying site is within the sole discretion
of the commissioner, subject to the process provided by this section, and available unencumbered
money in the appropriation. The commissioner's decisions and application of the priorities under
section 116J.555 are not subject to judicial review, except for abuse of discretion.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116J.555, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Priorities. (a) The legislature expects that applications for grants will exceed the

available appropriations and the agency will be able to provide grants to only some of the applicant
development authorities.
    (b) If applications for grants for qualified sites exceed the available appropriations, the agency
shall make grants for sites that, in the commissioner's judgment, provide the highest return in public
benefits for the public costs incurred and that meet all the requirements provided by law. In making
this judgment, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the recommendations or ranking of projects by the commissioner of the Pollution Control
Agency regarding the potential threat to public health and the environment that would be reduced
or eliminated by completion of each of the response action plans;
    (2) the potential increase in the property tax base of the local taxing jurisdictions, considered
relative to the fiscal needs of the jurisdictions, that will result from developments that will occur
because of completion of each of the response action plans;
    (3) the social value to the community of the cleanup and redevelopment of the site, including
the importance of development of the proposed public facilities on each of the sites;
    (4) the probability that each site will be cleaned up without use of government money in the
reasonably foreseeable future by considering but not limited to the current market value of the site
versus the cleanup cost;
   (5) the amount of cleanup costs for each site; and
   (6) the amount of the commitment of municipal or other local resources to pay for the cleanup
costs.
    The factors are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather the commissioner may weigh each
factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner considers appropriate. The
commissioner may consider other factors that affect the net return of public benefits for completion
of the response action plan. The commissioner, notwithstanding the listing of priorities and the goal
of maximizing the return of public benefits, shall make grants that distribute available money to
sites both within and outside of the metropolitan area. The commissioner shall provide a written
statement of the supporting reasons for each grant. Unless sufficient applications are not received
for qualifying sites outside of the metropolitan area, at least 2
                                                                ­­

in the revolving fund that originated as operational charges to individuals licensed under this
subdivision for the establishment, operation, and supervision of vending stands by blind persons
for the following purposes:
   (1) purchase, upkeep and replacement of equipment;
   (2) expenses incidental to the setting up of new stands and improvement of old stands;
   (3) reimbursement under section 15.059 to individual blind vending operators for reasonable
expenses incurred in attending supervisory meetings as called by the commissioner and other
expenditures for management services consistent with federal law; and
    (4) purchase of fringe benefits for blind vending operators and their employees such as group
health insurance, retirement program, vacation or sick leave assistance provided that the purchase
of any fringe benefit is approved by a majority vote of blind vending operators licensed pursuant to
this subdivision after the commissioner provides to each blind vending operator information on all
matters relevant to the fringe benefits. "Majority vote" means a majority of blind vending operators
voting. Fringe benefits shall be paid only from assessments of operators for specific benefits, gifts
to the fund for fringe benefit purposes, and vending income which is not assignable to an individual
stand.
    (c) Money originally deposited as merchandise and supplies repayments by individuals
licensed under this subdivision may be expended for initial and replacement stocks of supplies and
merchandise. Money originally deposited from vending income on federal property must be spent

   (d) All other deposits may be used for the purchase of general liability insurance or any other
expense related to the operation and supervision of vending stands.
    (e) The commissioner shall issue each license for the operation of a vending stand or vending
machine for an indefinite period but may terminate any license in the manner provided. In granting
licenses for new or vacated stands preference on the basis of seniority of experience in operating
stands under the control of the commissioner shall be given to capable operators who are deemed
competent to handle the enterprise under consideration. Application of this preference shall not
prohibit the commissioner from selecting an operator from the community in which the stand is
located.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.626, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. County and tribal biennial service agreements. (a) Effective January 1, 2004, and
each two-year period thereafter, each county and tribe must have in place an approved biennial
service agreement related to the services and programs in this chapter. In counties with a city of
the first class with a population over 300,000, the county must consider a service agreement that
includes a jointly developed plan for the delivery of employment services with the city. Counties
may collaborate to develop multicounty, multitribal, or regional service agreements.
   (b) The service agreements will be completed in a form prescribed by the commissioner. The
agreement must include:
   (1) a statement of the needs of the service population and strengths and resources in the
community;
    (2) numerical goals for participant outcomes measures to be accomplished during the biennial
period. The commissioner may identify outcomes from section 256J.751, subdivision 2, as core
outcomes for all counties and tribes;
    (3) strategies the county or tribe will pursue to achieve the outcome targets. Strategies must
include specification of how funds under this section will be used and may include community
partnerships that will be established or strengthened;
   (4) strategies the county or tribe will pursue under family stabilization services; and
   (5) other items prescribed by the commissioner in consultation with counties and tribes.
    (c) The commissioner shall provide each county and tribe with information needed to complete
an agreement, including: (1) information on MFIP cases in the county or tribe; (2) comparisons with
the rest of the state; (3) baseline performance on outcome measures; and (4) promising program
practices.
    (d) The service agreement must be submitted to the commissioner by October 15, 2003, and
October 15 of each second year thereafter. The county or tribe must allow a period of not less than
30 days prior to the submission of the agreement to solicit comments from the public on the contents
of the agreement.
    (e) The commissioner must, within 60 days of receiving each county or tribal service agreement,
inform the county or tribe if the service agreement is approved. If the service agreement is not

payments to employers for on-the-job training costs that, during the period of the training, must not
exceed 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to the participant. The payments are deemed
to be in compensation for the extraordinary costs associated with training participants under this
section and in compensation for the costs associated with the lower productivity of the participants
during training.

    Subd. 3. Evaluation of applications. (a) The commissioner shall review and evaluate the
applications submitted pursuant to subdivision 2 and shall determine whether each area is eligible
for designation as an enterprise zone. In determining whether an area is eligible under section
469.168, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), if unemployment, employment, income, or other necessary
data are not available for the area from the federal departments of labor or commerce or the state
demographer, the commissioner may rely upon other data submitted by the municipality if the
commissioner determines it is statistically reliable or accurate. The commissioner, together with
the commissioner of revenue, shall prepare an estimate of the amount of state tax revenue which
will be foregone for each application if the area is designated as a zone.
   (b) By October 1 of each year, the commissioner shall submit to the Legislative Advisory
Commission a list of the areas eligible for designation as enterprise zones, along with
recommendations for designation and supporting documentation. In making recommendations

for designation, the commissioner shall consider and evaluate the applications pursuant to the
following criteria:
    (1) the pervasiveness of poverty, unemployment, and general distress in the area;
   (2) the extent of chronic abandonment, deterioration, or reduction in value of commercial,
industrial, or residential structures in the area and the extent of property tax arrearages in the area;
    (3) the prospects for new investment and economic development in the area with the tax
reductions proposed in the application relative to the state and local tax revenue which would be
foregone;
    (4) the competing needs of other areas of the state;
    (5) the municipality's proposed use of other state and federal development funds or programs to
increase the probability of new investment and development occurring;

residents of the economic hardship area, and particularly individuals who are unemployed or who

       Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.053, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Election. (a) Any nonprofit organization that has employees in covered
employment must pay taxes on a quarterly basis in accordance with section 268.051 unless it elects
to make reimbursements to the trust fund the amount of unemployment benefits charged to its
reimbursable account under section 268.047.
    The organization may elect to make reimbursements for a period of not less than two calendar
years beginning with the date that the organization was determined to be an employer with covered
employment by filing a notice of election not later than 30 calendar days after the date of the
determination.
    (b) Any nonprofit organization that makes an election will continue to be liable for
reimbursements until it files a notice terminating its election not later than 30 calendar days before
the beginning of the calendar year the termination is to be effective.
    (c) A nonprofit organization that has been making reimbursements that files a notice of
termination of election must be assigned the new employer tax rate under section 268.051,
subdivision 5, for the calendar year of the termination of election and unless or until it qualifies for
an experience rating under section 268.051, subdivision 3.
       (d) Any nonprofit organization that has been paying taxes may elect to make reimbursements by
filing no less than 30 calendar days before January 1 of any calendar year a notice of election. U                                                                          ­p­o ­n­

state funds and are not considered paid from any special insurance plan, nor as paid by an employer.
An application for unemployment benefits is not considered a claim against an employer but is
considered a request for unemployment benefits from the trust fund. The commissioner has the
responsibility for the proper payment of unemployment benefits regardless of the level of interest
or participation by an applicant or an employer in any determination or appeal. An applicant's
entitlement to unemployment benefits must be determined based upon that information available

The number of weeks of payment is determined as follows:
    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received is divided by
the applicant's last level of regular weekly pay from the employer; or
   (2) if the payment is made in a lump sum, that sum is divided by the applicant's last level of
regular weekly pay from the employer.
    (c) If the payment is less than the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount,
unemployment benefits are reduced by the amount of the payment. ­                 I­

and
   (3) credited to the maximum amount of unemployment benefits available to the applicant in a
benefit year that includes the weeks for which back pay was deducted.

The attachment to the work force must be genuine. An applicant may restrict availability to suitable
employment, but there must be no other restrictions, either self-imposed or created by circumstances,
temporary or permanent, that prevent accepting suitable employment.
   (b) To be considered "available for suitable employment," a student must be willing to quit
school to accept suitable employment.
    (c) An applicant who is absent from the labor market area for personal reasons, other than to
search for work, is not "available for suitable employment."
   (d) An applicant who has restrictions on the hours of the day or days of the week that the
applicant can or will work, that are not normal for the applicant's usual occupation or other suitable
employment, is not "available for suitable employment." An applicant must be available for daytime
employment, if suitable employment is performed during the daytime, even though the applicant
previously worked the night shift.

UNEMPLOYMENT.
    (a) An applicant who elects to become temporarily unemployed in order to avoid the layoff of
another employee with the applicant's employer due to lack of work is not ineligible for benefits
under the leave of absence provisions of section 268.085, subdivision 13a, nor ineligible under the
quit provisions of section 268.095, if:
    (1) the election is authorized under a collective bargaining agreement or written employer policy;
    (2) the employer has accepted the applicant's election;
   (3) the employer provides a written certification that is provided to the department that the
applicant's election prevented another employee with the employer from being laid off due to lack
of work; and
   (4) both the applicant and the employer, at the time of the election, expect the applicant's
unemployment from the employer to be temporary.
   (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), for unemployment benefits to be payable,
an applicant must meet all the other benefit eligibility requirements under this chapter, including
being available for suitable employment with a different employer.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Quit. An applicant who quit employment is ineligible for all unemployment
benefits according to subdivision 10 except when:
    (1) the applicant quit the employment because of a good reason caused by the employer as
defined in subdivision 3;
   (2) the applicant quit the employment to accept other covered employment that provided
substantially better terms and conditions of employment, but the applicant did not work long
enough at the second employment to have sufficient subsequent earnings to satisfy the period
of ineligibility that would otherwise be imposed under subdivision 10 for quitting the first
employment;
   (3) the applicant quit the employment within 30 calendar days of beginning the employment
because the employment was unsuitable for the applicant;
    (4) the employment was unsuitable for the applicant and the applicant quit to enter reemployment
assistance training;
    (5) the employment was part time and the applicant also had full-time employment in the base
period, from which full-time employment the applicant separated because of reasons for which the
applicant was held not to be ineligible, and the wage credits from the full-time employment are
sufficient to meet the minimum requirements to establish a benefit account under section 268.07;
    (6) the applicant quit because the employer notified the applicant that the applicant was going
to be laid off because of lack of work within 30 calendar days. An applicant who quit employment
within 30 calendar days of a notified date of layoff because of lack of work is ineligible for
unemployment benefits through the end of the week that includes the scheduled date of layoff;
    (7) the applicant quit the employment because the applicant's serious illness or injury made it
medically necessary that the applicant quit, provided that the applicant inform the employer of the
serious illness or injury and request accommodation and no reasonable accommodation is made
available.
    If the applicant's serious illness is chemical dependency, this exception does not apply if
the applicant was previously diagnosed as chemically dependent or had treatment for chemical
dependency, and since that diagnosis or treatment has failed to make consistent efforts to control
the chemical dependency.
  This exception raises an issue of the applicant's being ­ ab

    (9) domestic abuse of the applicant or the applicant's minor child, necessitated the applicant's
quitting the employment. Domestic abuse must be shown by one or more of the following:

   (i) a district court order for protection or other documentation of equitable relief issued by a
court;
   (ii) a police record documenting the domestic abuse;
    (iii) documentation that the perpetrator of the domestic abuse has been convicted of the offense
of domestic abuse;
   (iv) medical documentation of domestic abuse; or
   (v) written statement that the applicant or the applicant's minor child is a victim of domestic
abuse, provided by a social worker, member of the clergy, shelter worker, attorney at law, or other
professional who has assisted the applicant in dealing with the domestic abuse.
   Domestic abuse for purposes of this clause is defined under section 518B.01.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
  Subd. 2. Quit defined. (a) A quit from employment occurs when the decision to end the
employment was, at the time the employment ended, the employee's.
    (b) An employee who has been notified that the employee will be discharged in the future, who
chooses to end the employment while employment in any capacity is still available, is considered
to have quit the employment.
    (c) An employee who seeks to withdraw a previously submitted notice of quitting is considered
to have quit the employment if the employer does not agree that the notice may be withdrawn.
    (d) An applicant who, within five calendar days after completion of a suitable temporary job
assignment from a staffing service employer, (1) fails without good cause to affirmatively request
an additional job assignment, ­
                              o­r (2) refuses without good cause an additional suitable job assignment
offered, or (3) accepts employment with the client of the staffing service, is considered to have quit
employment with the staffing service. Accepting employment with the client of the staffing service
meets the requirements of the exception to ineligibility under subdivision 1, clause (2).
   This paragraph applies only if, at the time of beginning of employment with the staffing service
employer, the applicant signed and was provided a copy of a separate document written in clear and
concise language that informed the applicant of this paragraph and that unemployment benefits may
be affected.
    For purposes of this paragraph, "good cause" is a reason that is significant and would compel
an average, reasonable worker, who would otherwise want an additional temporary job assignment
with the staffing service employer, (1) to fail to contact the staffing service employer, or (2) to refuse
an offered assignment.
   For purposes of this paragraph, a "staffing service employer" is an employer whose business
involves employing individuals directly for the purpose of furnishing temporary job assignment
workers to clients of the staffing service.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.103, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 2a. Employer-agent appeals filed online. (a) If an agent files an appeal on behalf of an

employer, the appeal must be filed online. The appeal must be filed through the electronic address
provided on the determination being appealed. Use of another method of filing does not constitute
an appeal. This paragraph does not apply to an employee filing an appeal on behalf of an employer.
   (b) All information requested when the appeal is filed must be supplied or the communication
does not constitute an appeal.
    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.18, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Court fees; collection fees. (a) If the commissioner is required to pay any court fees
in an attempt to enforce collection of overpaid unemployment benefits, penalties, or interest, the
commissioner may add the amount of the court fees to the total amount due.
    (b) If an applicant who has been determined overpaid unemployment benefits because of
fraud seeks to have any portion of the debt discharged under the federal bankruptcy code, and the
commissioner files an objection in bankruptcy court to the discharge, the commissioner may add
the commissioner's cost of any court fees to the debt if the bankruptcy court does not discharge
the debt.
    (c) If the Internal Revenue Service assesses the commissioner a fee for offsetting from a federal
tax refund the amount of any fraud overpayment, including penalties and interest, the amount of the
fee may be added to the total amount due. The offset amount must be put in the trust fund and that
amount credited to the total amount due from the applicant.
    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.186, is amended to read:
    268.186 RECORDS; AUDITS.
    (a) Each employer must keep true and accurate records for the periods of time and containing
the information the commissioner may require by rule. For the purpose of administering this
chapter, the commissioner has the power to audit, examine, or cause to be supplied or copied,
any books, correspondence, papers, records, or memoranda that are relevant, whether the books,
correspondence, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the
employer or any other person at any reasonable time and as often as may be necessary.
     (b) Any employer that refuses to allow an audit of its records by the department, or that fails to
make all necessary records available for audit in Minnesota upon request of the commissioner, may
be assessed an administrative penalty of $500. An employer that fails to provide a weekly breakdown
of money earned by an applicant upon request of the commissioner, information necessary for the
detection of applicant fraud under section 268.18, subdivision 2, may be assessed an administrative
penalty of $100. Any notice requesting a weekly breakdown must clearly state that a $100 penalty
may be assessed for failure to provide the information. The penalty collected is credited to the

    Sec. 16. ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. Minnesota has been awarded a federal grant by the United States
Department of Labor under the Project GATE (Growing America Through Entrepreneurship)
program to assist certain dislocated workers in starting a business. Providing unemployment
benefits while the dislocated worker is receiving services such as entrepreneurial training, business
counseling, and technical assistance will assist in the success of this pilot project. In order to
provide unemployment benefits, the commissioner of employment and economic development is
authorized to waive the availability for suitable employment requirements of Minnesota Statutes,
section 268.085, subdivision 1, as well as the earnings deductibility provisions of Minnesota
Statutes, section 268.085, subdivision 5, for individuals enrolled in this pilot project.
    Subd. 2. Limitations. A maximum of 500 applicants for unemployment benefits are authorized
to receive a waiver.
    Subd. 3. Expiration date. The authorization under subdivision 1 expires June 30, 2012.
    Sec. 17. EFFECTIVE DATE.
    Sections 1 to 6, 8 to 12, 14, and 15 are effective August 2, 2009, and apply to all department
determinations and unemployment law judge decisions issued on or after that date. Section 13 is
effective April 1, 2010, and applies to all department determinations and unemployment law judge
decisions issued on or after that date. Section 7 is effective retroactively from December 1, 2008.
Section 16 is effective the day following final enactment.

    Subd. 2. Statutory application. This chapter is remedial in nature and must be applied in
favor of awarding unemployment benefits. Any legal conclusion that results in an applicant being
ineligible for unemployment benefits must be fully supported by the facts. In determining eligibility
or ineligibility for benefits, any statutory provision that would preclude an applicant from receiving

amount of unemployment benefits used in computing the future tax rate of taxpaying employers or
charged to the reimbursable account of a nonprofit or government employer that has elected to be
liable for reimbursements is the same percentage of the total amount of unemployment benefits paid
as the percentage of wage credits from the employer is of the total amount of wage credits from all
the applicant's base period employers.

      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.051, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
      Subd. 4. Experience rating history transfer. (a) When:
   (1) a taxpaying employer acquires all of the organization, trade or business, or workforce of
another taxpaying employer; and
    (2) there is 25 percent or more common ownership or there is substantially common management
or control between the predecessor and successor, the experience rating history of the predecessor
employer is transferred to the successor employer.
      (b) When:
   (1) a taxpaying employer acquires a portion, but less than all, of the organization, trade or
business, or workforce of another taxpaying employer; and
    (2) there is 25 percent or more common ownership or there is substantially common
management or control between the predecessor and successor, the successor employer acquires,
as of the date of acquisition, the experience rating history attributable to the portion it acquired, and
the predecessor employer retains the experience rating history attributable to the portion that it has
retained. If the commissioner determines that sufficient information is not available to substantiate
that a distinct severable portion was acquired and to assign the appropriate distinct severable

that percentage of the predecessor employer's experience rating history equal to that percentage of
the employment positions it has obtained, and the predecessor employer retains that percentage of
the experience rating history equal to the percentage of the employment positions it has retained.

    (d) Each successor employer that is subject to paragraph (a) or (b) must notify the commissioner
of the acquisition by electronic transmission, in a format prescribed by the commissioner, within

commissioner is subject to the penalties under section 268.184, subdivision 1a, if the successor's

the penalties are credited to the administration account to be used to ensure integrity in the
unemployment insurance program.
    (e) If the successor employer under paragraphs (a) and (b) had an experience rating at the time
of the acquisition, the transferred experience rating history of the predecessor is combined with the
successor's experience rating history for purposes of recomputing a tax rate.
  (f) If there has been a transfer of an experience rating history under paragraph (a) or (b),
employment with a predecessor employer is not considered to have been terminated if similar
employment is offered by the successor employer and accepted by the employee.

if the employer fails to provide the required notification, ­

the issue of succession or nonsuccession, recompute the tax rate under subdivision 6 of all employers
affected. The commissioner ­ sh

or electronic transmission. Any affected employer may appeal the recomputed tax rate in accordance
with the procedures in subdivision 6, paragraph (c).
    (h) The "experience rating history" for purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 4a means
the amount of unemployment benefits paid and the taxable wages that are being used and would be
used in computing the current and any future experience rating.
    For purposes of this chapter, an "acquisition" means anything that results in the obtaining by the
successor employer, in any way or manner, of the organization, trade or business, or workforce of
the predecessor employer.
   A "distinct severable portion" in paragraph (b) means a location or unit separately identifiable
within the employer's wage detail report under section 268.044.
    (i) Regardless of the ownership, management, or control requirements of paragraph (a), if there is
an acquisition or merger of a publicly held corporation by or with another publicly held corporation
the experience rating histories of the corporations are combined as of the date of acquisition or
merger for the purpose of recomputing a tax rate.

                                 l­ must examine each application for unemployment benefits to
determine the base period and the benefit year, and based upon all the covered employment in
the base period the commissioner shall determine the weekly unemployment benefit amount
available, if any, and the maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, if any. The

                            t­­e, which is a document separate and distinct from a document titled
a determination of eligibility or determination of ineligibility issued under section 268.101, must
be titled determination of benefit account. A determination of benefit account must be sent to the
applicant and all base period employers, by mail or electronic transmission.
    (c) If a base period employer did not provide wage information for the applicant as provided for
in section 268.044, or provided erroneous information, the commissioner may accept an applicant
certification as to wage credits, based upon the applicant's records, and issue a determination of
benefit account.
    (d) The commissioner may, at any time within 24 months from the establishment of a benefit
account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended determination if the
commissioner finds that the determination was incorrect for any reason. An amended determination
of benefit account must be promptly sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by mail
or electronic transmission. This subdivision does not apply to documents titled determinations of
eligibility or determinations of ineligibility issued under section 268.101.
    (e) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly unemployment benefit
amount or maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, any unemployment benefits
that have been paid greater than the applicant was entitled is considered an overpayment of
unemployment benefits. A determination or amended determination issued under this section that
results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount of the overpayment
and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid unemployment benefits
must be repaid.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
  Subd. 2. Benefit account requirements and weekly unemployment benefit amount and
maximum amount of unemployment benefits. (a) To establish a benefit account, an applicant
must have:
   (1) high quarter wage credits of $1,000 or more; and
   (2) wage credits, in other than the high quarter, of $250 or more.
   (b) If an applicant has established a benefit account, the weekly unemployment benefit amount
available during the benefit year is the higher of:
   (1) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the base period, to a maximum of
66-2/3 percent of the state's average weekly wage; or
   (2) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the high quarter, to a maximum of
43 percent of the state's average weekly wage.
50TH DAY]                                          FRIDAY, MAY 8, 2009                                                          4371

   The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (1) is computed by dividing the total wage
credits by 52. The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (2) is computed by dividing the
high quarter wage credits by 13.

for this subdivision is to prevent an applicant from establishing more than one benefit account as a

     Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.084, is amended to read:
     268.084 PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER; PRESUMPTION.
     (a) Each applicant must be issued a personal identification number (PIN) for the purpose of
filing continued requests for unemployment benefits, accessing information, and engaging in other
transactions with the department.
    (b) If a PIN assigned to an applicant is used in the filing of a continued request for unemployment
benefits under section ­26

                            .­ 8­ 268.0865 or any other type of transaction, the applicant is presumed
                               ­6
to have been the individual using that PIN and presumed to have received any unemployment benefit
payment issued. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence showing that
the applicant assigned the PIN was not the individual who used that PIN in the transaction.

later receives compensation as a result of the pending claim, the applicant is subject to the provisions
of paragraph (a) and the unemployment benefits paid are subject to recoupment by the commissioner
to the extent that the compensation constitutes overpaid unemployment benefits.
    (c) If the amount of compensation described under paragraph (a) for any week is less than the
applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount, unemployment benefits requested for that week
are reduced by the amount of that compensation payment.

   Subd. 4. Social Security benefits. (a) Any applicant aged 62 or over is required to state

Social Security old age benefits for any week during the benefit year.

    If an applicant meets the requirements of clause (1) there is no deduction from the applicant's
weekly benefit amount for any Social Security disability benefits. If only clause (2) applies, then
there must be deducted from the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount 50 percent of
the weekly equivalent of the primary Social Security disability benefits the applicant is receiving,
has received, or has filed for, with respect to that week; provided, however, that if the Social
Security Administration determines that an individual is not entitled to receive primary Social
Security disability benefits for any week the applicant has applied for those benefits, the 50 percent
deduction does not apply to that week.

benefit amount, the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for that week.
    (b) If the applicant has earnings, with respect to any week, that is less than the applicant's
weekly unemployment benefit amount, from employment, covered employment, noncovered
employment, self-employment, or volunteer work, 55 percent of the earnings are deducted from
the weekly unemployment benefit amount.

subdivision 3, but includes all compensation considered wages under section 268.035, subdivision
29, and any other compensation considered earned income under state and federal law for income
tax purposes.
   Sec. 28. [268.0865] CONTINUED REQUEST FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
    Subdivision 1. Continued request for unemployment benefits defined. A continued request
for unemployment benefits is a certification by an applicant, done on a weekly basis, that the
applicant is unemployed and meets the ongoing eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits
under section 268.085. A continued request must include information on possible issues of
ineligibility in accordance with section 268.101, subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
   Subd. 2. Filing continued requests for unemployment benefits. (a) The commissioner must
designate to each applicant one of the following methods for filing a continued request:
   (1) by electronic transmission under subdivision 3; or
   (2) by mail under subdivision 4.
    (b) The method designated by the commissioner is the only method allowed for filing a continued
request by that applicant. An applicant may ask that the other allowed method be designated and
the commissioner must consider inconvenience to the applicant as well as administrative capacity
in determining whether to allow an applicant to change the designated method for filing a continued
request for unemployment benefits.
    Subd. 3. Continued request for unemployment benefits by electronic transmission. (a)
A continued request for unemployment benefits by electronic transmission must be filed to that
electronic mail address, telephone number, or Internet address prescribed by the commissioner
for that applicant. In order to constitute a continued request, all information asked for, including
information authenticating that the applicant is sending the transmission, must be provided in the
format required. If all of the information asked for is not provided, the communication does not
constitute a continued request for unemployment benefits.
   (b) The electronic transmission communication must be filed on the date and during the time of
day designated for the applicant for filing a continued request by electronic transmission.
     (c) If the electronic transmission continued request is not filed on the date and during the time of
day designated, a continued request by electronic transmission must be accepted if the applicant files
the continued request by electronic transmission within two calendar weeks following the week in
which the date designated occurred. If the continued request by electronic transmission is not filed
within two calendar weeks following the week in which the date designated occurred, the electronic
continued request will not be accepted and the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for
the period covered by the continued request, unless the applicant shows good cause for failing to
file the continued request by electronic transmission within the time period required.
   Subd. 4. Continued request for unemployment benefits by mail. (a) A continued request for
unemployment benefits by mail must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner. The form, in
order to constitute a continued request, must be totally completed and signed by the applicant. The
form must be filed on the date required for the applicant for filing a continued request by mail, in an
envelope with postage prepaid, and sent to the address designated.

    (b) If the mail continued request for unemployment benefits is not filed on the date designated, a
continued request must be accepted if the form is filed by mail within two calendar weeks following
the week in which the date designated occurred. If the form is not filed within two calendar weeks
following the week in which the date designated occurred, the form will not be accepted and the
applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for the period covered by the continued request
for unemployment benefits, unless the applicant shows good cause for failing to file the form by
mail within the time period required.
    (c) If the applicant has been designated to file a continued request for unemployment benefits by
mail, an applicant may submit the form by facsimile transmission on the day otherwise required for
mailing, or within two calendar weeks following the week in which the date designated occurred. A
form submitted by facsimile transmission must be sent only to the telephone number assigned for
that purpose.
    (d) An applicant who has been designated to file a continued request by mail may personally
deliver a continued request form only to the location to which the form was otherwise designated
to be mailed.
     Subd. 5. Good cause defined. (a) "Good cause" for purposes of this section is a compelling
substantial reason that would have prevented a reasonable person acting with due diligence from
filing a continued request for unemployment benefits within the time periods required.
    (b) "Good cause" does not include forgetfulness, loss of the continued request form if filing by
mail, having returned to work, having an appeal pending, or inability to file a continued request
for unemployment benefits by the method designated if the applicant was aware of the inability
and did not make diligent effort to have the method of filing a continued request changed by the
commissioner. "Good cause" does not include having previously made an attempt to file a continued
request for unemployment benefits but where the communication was not considered a continued
request because the applicant failed to submit all required information.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Ineligibility duration. (a) Ineligibility from the payment of all unemployment benefits
under subdivisions 1 and 4 is for the duration of the applicant's unemployment and until the end of
the calendar week that the applicant had total earnings in subsequent covered employment of eight
times the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount.
   (b) Ineligibility imposed under subdivisions 1 and 4 begins on the Sunday of the week that the
applicant became separated from employment.
    (c) In addition to paragraph (a), if the applicant was discharged from employment because of
aggravated employment misconduct, wage credits from that employment are canceled and cannot
be used for purposes of a benefit account under section 268.07, subdivision 2.

   (b) Paragraph (a) also applies to employment covered under an unemployment insurance
program of any other state or established by an act of Congress.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.101, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notification. (a) In an application for unemployment benefits, each applicant
must report the name and the reason for no longer working for the applicant's most recent employer,
as well as the names of all employers and the reasons for no longer working for all employers
during the six calendar months before the date of the application. If the reason reported for no
longer working for any of those employers is other than a layoff because of lack of work, that
raises an issue of ineligibility that the department must determine. An applicant must report any
offers of employment refused during the eight calendar weeks before the date of the application for
unemployment benefits and the name of the employer that made the offer. An applicant's failure to
report the name of an employer, or giving an incorrect reason for no longer working for an employer,
or failing to disclose an offer of employment that was refused, is a violation of section 268.182,
subdivision 2.
    In an application, the applicant must also provide all information necessary to determine the
applicant's eligibility for unemployment benefits under this chapter. If the applicant fails or refuses
to provide information necessary to determine the applicant's eligibility for unemployment benefits,
the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.085, subdivision 2, until the
applicant provides this required information.
     (b) Upon establishment of a benefit account under section 268.07, subdivision 2, the
commissioner shall notify, by mail or electronic transmission, all employers the applicant was
required to report on the application and all base period employers and determined successors
to those employers under section 268.051, subdivision 4, in order to provide the employer
an opportunity to raise, in a manner and format prescribed by the commissioner, any issue of
ineligibility. An employer must be informed of the effect that failure to raise an issue of ineligibility
as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant, w ­­t

    (c) Each applicant must report any employment, and loss of employment, and offers of
employment refused, during those weeks the applicant filed continued requests for unemployment
benefits under section ­    26  .­ ­

                                    ­ 268.0865. Each applicant who stops filing continued requests
during the benefit year and later begins filing continued requests during that same benefit year must
report the name of any employer the applicant worked for during the period between the filing of
continued requests and the reason the applicant stopped working for the employer. The applicant
must report any offers of employment refused during the period between the filing of continued
requests for unemployment benefits. Those employers from which the applicant has reported
a loss of employment under this paragraph must be notified by mail or electronic transmission
and provided an opportunity to raise, in a manner prescribed by the commissioner, any issue of
ineligibility. An employer must be informed of the effect that failure to raise an issue of ineligibility
as a result of a quit or a discharge of the applicant may have on the employer under section 268.047.
    (d) The purpose for requiring the applicant to report the name of employers and the reason for no
longer working for those employers, or offers of employment refused, under paragraphs (a) and (c)
is for the commissioner to obtain information from an applicant raising all issues that may result in

the applicant being ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.095, because of a quit
or discharge, or the applicant being ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.085,
subdivision 13c. If the reason given by the applicant for no longer working for an employer is
other than a layoff because of lack of work, that raises an issue of ineligibility and the applicant is
required, as part of the determination process under subdivision 2, paragraph (a), to state all the facts
about the cause for no longer working for the employer, if known. If the applicant fails or refuses
to provide any required information, the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits under
section 268.085, subdivision 2, until the applicant provides this required information.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.101, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Determination. (a) The commissioner ­       s­

                                                             l­ must determine any issue of ineligibility
raised by information required from an applicant under subdivision 1, paragraph (a) or (c), and send
to the applicant and any involved employer, by mail or electronic transmission, a document titled a
determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility, as is appropriate. The determination
on an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or a discharge of the applicant must state the effect
on the employer under section 268.047. A determination must be made in accordance with this
paragraph even if a notified employer has not raised the issue of ineligibility.
    (b) The commissioner ­  sh
                             ­­ l­ must determine any issue of ineligibility raised by an employer and
                               a­l
send to the applicant and that employer, by mail or electronic transmission, a document titled a
determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility as is appropriate. The determination
on an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant must state the effect on
the employer under section 268.047.
   If a base period employer:
   (1) was not the applicant's most recent employer before the application for unemployment
benefits;
   (2) did not employ the applicant during the six calendar months before the application for
unemployment benefits; and
    (3) did not raise an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant within
ten calendar days of notification under subdivision 1, paragraph (b);
then any exception under section 268.047, subdivisions 2 and 3, begins the Sunday two weeks
following the week that the issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant
was raised by the employer.
    A communication from an employer must specifically set out why the applicant should be
determined ineligible for unemployment benefits for that communication to be considered to have
raised an issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section. A statement of "protest" or a similar
term without more information does not constitute raising an issue of ineligibility for purposes of
this section.
    (c) Subject to section 268.031, an issue of ineligibility is determined based upon that information
required of an applicant, any information that may be obtained from an applicant or employer, and
information from any other source,  ­   i­h

to an applicant a copy of the determination where the applicant has satisfied a period of ineligibility
because of a quit or a discharge under section 268.095, subdivision 10.
     (e) The commissioner may issue a determination on an issue of ineligibility at any time within 24
months from the establishment of a benefit account based upon information from any source, even
if the issue of ineligibility was not raised by the applicant or an employer. This paragraph does not
prevent the imposition of a penalty on an applicant under section 268.18, subdivision 2, or 268.182.
    (f) A determination of eligibility or determination of ineligibility is final unless an appeal is
filed by the applicant or notified employer within 20 calendar days after sending. The determination
must contain a prominent statement indicating the consequences of not appealing. Proceedings on
the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    (g) An issue of ineligibility required to be determined under this section includes any question
regarding the denial or allowing of unemployment benefits under this chapter except for issues under
section 268.07. An issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section includes any question of effect
on an employer under section 268.047.
    (h) Except for issues of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant, the employer
will be (1) sent a copy of the determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility, or
(2) considered an involved employer for purposes of an appeal under section 268.105, only if the
employer raised the issue of ineligibility.

the beginning of the hearing the unemployment law judge must fully explain how the hearing
will be conducted, that the applicant has the right to request that the hearing be rescheduled
so that documents or witnesses can be subpoenaed, that the facts will be determined based on
a preponderance of the evidence, and, in clear and simple language, the meaning of the term
"preponderance of the evidence." The unemployment law judge must ensure that all relevant facts
are clearly and fully developed. The department may adopt rules on evidentiary hearings. The
rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of
procedure. The department has discretion regarding the method by which the evidentiary hearing
is conducted. A report of any employee of the department, except a determination, made in the
regular course of the employee's duties, is competent evidence of the facts contained in it. An
affidavit or written statement based on personal knowledge and signed under penalty of perjury
is competent evidence of the facts contained in it; however, the veracity of statements contained
within the document or the credibility of the witness making the statement may be disputed with
other documents or testimony and production of such documents or testimony may be compelled
by subpoena.
     (c) After the conclusion of the hearing, upon the evidence obtained, the unemployment law judge
must make findings of fact and decision and send those, by mail or electronic transmission, to all
involved parties. When the credibility of an involved party or witness testifying in an evidentiary
hearing has a significant effect on the outcome of a decision, the unemployment law judge must set
out the reason for crediting or discrediting that testimony. The unemployment law judge's decision
is final unless a request for reconsideration is filed under subdivision 2.
   (d) Regardless of paragraph (c), if the appealing party fails to participate in the evidentiary
hearing, the unemployment law judge has the discretion to dismiss the appeal by summary order.
By failing to participate, the appealing party is considered to have failed to exhaust available
administrative remedies unless the appealing party files a request for reconsideration under
subdivision 2 and establishes good cause for failing to participate in the evidentiary hearing under
subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Submission of a written statement does not constitute participation.
The applicant must participate personally and appearance solely by a representative does not
constitute participation.
   (e) Only employees of the department who are attorneys licensed to practice law in Minnesota
may serve as the chief unemployment law judge, senior unemployment law judges who are
supervisors, or unemployment law judges. The commissioner must designate a chief unemployment
law judge. The chief unemployment law judge may transfer to another unemployment law judge
any proceedings pending before an unemployment law judge.
    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Request for reconsideration. (a) Any involved applicant, involved employer, or
the commissioner may, within 20 calendar days of the sending of the unemployment law judge's
decision under subdivision 1, file a request for reconsideration asking the unemployment law judge
to reconsider that decision. Section 268.103 applies to a request for reconsideration. If a request for

an additional evidentiary hearing be conducted under subdivision 1; or
   (3) affirming the findings of fact and decision issued under subdivision 1.
    (b) Upon a timely request for reconsideration having been filed, the department must send a
notice, by mail or electronic transmission, to all involved parties that a request for reconsideration
has been filed. The notice must inform the involved parties:
    (1) of the opportunity to provide comment on the request for reconsideration, and the right
under subdivision 5 to obtain a copy of any recorded testimony and exhibits offered or received
into evidence at the evidentiary hearing;
    (2) that providing specific comments as to a perceived factual or legal error in the decision, or a
perceived error in procedure during the evidentiary hearing, will assist the unemployment law judge
in deciding the request for reconsideration;
   (3) of the right to obtain any comments and submissions provided by the other involved party
regarding the request for reconsideration; and
   (4) of the provisions of paragraph (c) regarding additional evidence.
This paragraph does not apply if paragraph (d) is applicable.
    (c) In deciding a request for reconsideration, the unemployment law judge must not, except for
purposes of determining whether to order an additional evidentiary hearing, consider any evidence
that was not submitted at the evidentiary hearing conducted under subdivision 1.
    The unemployment law judge must order an additional evidentiary hearing if an involved party
shows that evidence which was not submitted at the evidentiary hearing: (1) would likely change
the outcome of the decision and there was good cause for not having previously submitted that
evidence; or (2) would show that the evidence that was submitted at the evidentiary hearing was
likely false and that the likely false evidence had an effect on the outcome of the decision.
    (d) If the involved applicant or involved employer who filed the request for reconsideration
failed to participate in the evidentiary hearing conducted under subdivision 1, an order setting aside

must be issued if the party who failed to participate had good cause for failing to do so. In the notice
that a request for reconsideration has been filed, the party who failed to participate must be informed
of the requirement, and provided the opportunity, to show good cause for failing to participate. If the
unemployment law judge determines that good cause for failure to participate has not been shown,
the unemployment law judge must state that in the order issued under paragraph (a).
   Submission of a written statement at the evidentiary hearing under subdivision 1 does not
constitute participation for purposes of this paragraph.
   All involved parties must be informed of this paragraph with the notice of appeal and notice of
hearing provided for in subdivision 1.

judge.
    (f) The unemployment law judge must send to any involved applicant or involved employer,
by mail or electronic transmission, the order issued under this subdivision. An order modifying the
previously issued findings of fact and decision or an order affirming the previously issued findings
of fact and decision is the final department decision on the matter and is final and binding on the
involved applicant and involved employer unless judicial review is sought under subdivision 7.
    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Decisions. (a) If an unemployment law judge's decision or order allows unemployment
benefits to an applicant, the unemployment benefits must be paid regardless of any request for
reconsideration or any appeal to the Minnesota Court of Appeals having been filed.
    (b) If an unemployment law judge's decision or order modifies or reverses a determination, or
prior decision of the unemployment law judge, allowing unemployment benefits to an applicant,
any benefits paid in accordance with the determination, or prior decision of the unemployment law
judge, is considered an overpayment of those unemployment benefits. A decision or order issued
under this section that results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount
of the overpayment and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid
unemployment benefits must be repaid.
    (c) If an unemployment law judge's order under subdivision 2 allows unemployment benefits
to an applicant under section 268.095 because of a quit or discharge and the unemployment law
judge's decision is reversed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court of Minnesota,
the applicant cannot be held ineligible for any of the unemployment benefits paid the applicant and it
is not considered an overpayment of those unemployment benefits under section 268.18, subdivision
1. The effect of the court's reversal is the application of section 268.047, subdivision 3, in computing
the future tax rate of the employer.
    (d) If an unemployment law judge, under subdivision 2, orders the taking of additional evidence,
the unemployment law judge's prior decision must continue to be enforced until new findings of fact
and decision are made by the unemployment law judge.
    Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Oaths; subpoenas. An unemployment law judge has authority to administer oaths
and affirmations, take depositions, and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and
the production of documents and other personal property considered necessary as evidence in
connection with the subject matter of an evidentiary hearing.
  The unemployment law judge must give full consideration to a request for a subpoena and
must not unreasonably deny a request for a subpoena. If a subpoena request is initially denied,

the unemployment law judge must, on the unemployment law judge's own motion, reconsider that
request during the evidentiary hearing and rule on whether the request was properly denied. If the
request was not properly denied, the evidentiary hearing must be continued for issuance of the
subpoena. The subpoenas are enforceable through the district court in Ramsey County. Witnesses
subpoenaed, other than an involved applicant or involved employer or officers and employees of
an involved employer, must be paid by the department the same witness fees as in a civil action in
district court.
    Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Use of evidence; data privacy. (a) All testimony at any evidentiary hearing conducted
under subdivision 1 must be recorded. A copy of any recorded testimony and exhibits offered or
received into evidence at the hearing must, upon request, be furnished to a party at no cost during the
time period for filing a request for reconsideration or while a request for reconsideration is pending.
    (b) Regardless of any provision of law to the contrary, if recorded testimony and exhibits received
into evidence at the evidentiary hearing are not requested during the time period for filing a request
for reconsideration, ­
                     o­r while a request for reconsideration is pending, during the time for filing any
appeal under subdivision 7, or during the pendency thereof, that testimony and other evidence may
later be made available only under a district court order. A subpoena is not considered a district
court order.
    (c) Testimony obtained under subdivision 1, may not be used or considered for any purpose,
including impeachment, in any civil, administrative, or contractual proceeding, except by a local,
state, or federal human rights agency with enforcement powers, unless the proceeding is initiated
by the department.
    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.115, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Maximum amount of extended unemployment benefits. The maximum amount of
extended unemployment benefits available to an applicant is 50 percent of the maximum amount of
regular unemployment benefits available in the benefit year,

percent of the maximum amount of regular unemployment benefits available in the benefit year.
    Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.125, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

offset from any future unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of the overpayment.
Except when the overpayment resulted because the applicant failed to report deductible earnings or
deductible or benefit delaying payments, no single offset may exceed 50 percent of the amount of

    Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.18, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Overpayment because of fraud. (a) Any applicant who receives unemployment
benefits by knowingly misrepresenting, misstating, or failing to disclose any material fact, or who
makes a false statement or representation without a good faith belief as to the correctness of the
statement or representation, has committed fraud. After the discovery of facts indicating fraud,

benefits by fraud and that the applicant must promptly repay the unemployment benefits to the trust

fraudulently obtained. This penalty is in addition to penalties under section 268.182.
    (b) Unless the applicant files an appeal within 20 calendar days after the sending of the
determination of overpayment by fraud to the applicant by mail or electronic transmission, the
determination is final. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    (c) If the applicant fails to repay the unemployment benefits, penalty, and interest assessed, the
total due may be collected by the ­  s­

collection the commissioner may use to recover the overpayment. Money received in repayment
of fraudulently obtained unemployment benefits, penalties, and interest is first applied to the
unemployment benefits overpaid, then to the penalty amount due, then to any interest due. 62.5
percent of the payments made toward the penalty are credited to the contingent account and 37.5
percent credited to the administration account ­ f­

   (d) If an applicant has been overpaid unemployment benefits under the law of another state
because of fraud and that state certifies that the applicant is liable to repay the unemployment benefits
and requests the commissioner to recover the overpayment, the commissioner may offset from future
unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of overpayment.
    (e) Unemployment benefits paid for weeks more than four years before the date of a
determination of overpayment by fraud issued under this subdivision are not considered overpaid
unemployment benefits.

    Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.211, is amended to read:
    268.211 UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS TELEPHONE SYSTEM.
    The commissioner must ensure that ­h  t­­e any automated telephone system used for unemployment
insurance benefits provides an option for any caller to speak to an unemployment insurance
specialist. An individual who calls any of the publicized telephone numbers seeking information
about applying for unemployment benefits or on the status of a ­    c­a

option to speak on the telephone to a specialist who can provide direct assistance or can direct the
caller to the ­

                    ­ individual or office that is able to respond to the caller's needs.
    Sec. 49. UNEMPLOYMENT LAW JUDGES.
    It is in the public interest, as well as the interest of applicants and employees, that an
unemployment law judge conducting contested unemployment insurance hearings should be an
experienced attorney with a background in civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. An
unemployment law judge should have a level of skill equal to that of a workers' compensation judge.
In order to recruit and retain individuals with the appropriate skills, the pay of an unemployment
law judge should be commensurate with that of a workers' compensation judge, but should also
take into account the less formal nature of an unemployment insurance hearing. Before October
1, 2009, the commissioner of finance is directed, in consultation with the deputy commissioner
of employment and economic development and the chief unemployment law judge, to determine
and implement the appropriate pay level, with no more than two pay steps, for unemployment law
judges, giving consideration only to the pay level provided to workers' compensation judges, but
taking into account the less formal nature of an unemployment insurance hearing.
    Sec. 50. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
   In Minnesota Statutes, chapter 268, the revisor shall change "shall" to "must," except in
Minnesota Statutes, sections 268.035 and 268.103.
    Sec. 51. REPEALER.
    Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 268.085, subdivision 14; and 268.086, subdivisions 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, are repealed.
    Sec. 52. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Sections 1 to 48 and 50 are effective August 2, 2009, and apply to all department determinations
and unemployment law judge decisions issued on or after that date.
                                                   ARTICLE 5
                 LABOR STANDARDS AND WAGES; LICENSING AND FEES
    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16C.28, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 6. Contract awards. When prevailing wage laws apply, an agency shall not be liable for
costs under section 177.43, subdivision 3, if it has included language in its contracts which requires
4388                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [50TH DAY

vendors and contractors to comply with prevailing wage laws and the contract also contains the
following elements:
    (1) a description of the prevailing wage laws and a citation to relevant statutes;
    (2) contact details for further information from the Department of Labor and Industry; and
   (3) a statement of contractor and subcontractor liability for failure to adhere to prevailing wage
laws.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 177.27, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Compliance orders. The commissioner may issue an order requiring an employer
to comply with sections 177.21 to 177.435, 181.02, 181.03, 181.031, 181.032, 181.101, 181.11,
181.12, 181.13, 181.14, 181.145, 181.15, 181.275, subdivision 2a, and 181.79, or with any rule
promulgated under section 177.28. The commissioner shall issue an order requiring an employer to
comply with sections 177.41 to 177.435 if the violation is repeated. For purposes of this subdivision
only, a violation is repeated if at any time during the two years that preceded the date of violation,
the commissioner issued an order to the employer for violation of sections 177.41 to 177.435 and
the order is final or the commissioner and the employer have entered into a settlement agreement
that required the employer to pay back wages that were required by sections 177.41 to 177.435. The
department shall serve the order upon the employer or the employer's authorized representative in
person or by certified mail at the employer's place of business. An employer who wishes to contest
the order must file written notice of objection to the order with the commissioner within 15 calendar
days after being served with the order. A contested case proceeding must then be held in accordance
with sections 14.57 to 14.69. If, within 15 calendar days after being served with the order, the
employer fails to file a written notice of objection with the commissioner, the order becomes a final
order of the commissioner.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 177.30, is amended to read:
    177.30 KEEPING RECORDS; PENALTY.

    (3) the hours worked each day and each workweek by the employee;
    (4) for each employer subject to sections 177.41 to 177.44, and while performing work on public
works projects funded in whole or in part with state funds, the employer shall furnish under oath
signed by an owner or officer of an employer to the contracting authority and the project owner every
two weeks, a certified payroll report with respect to the wages and benefits paid each employee
during the preceding weeks specifying for each employee: name; identifying number; prevailing
wage master job classification ­o­

reasonable basis for believing that a person has engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of a
statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the board or
complaint committee may proceed as provided in subdivision 2 or 3. Except as otherwise provided
in this section, all hearings must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Subd. 2. Legal actions. (a) When necessary to prevent an imminent violation of a statute, rule,
or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the board, or a complaint
committee if authorized by the board, may bring an action in the name of the state in the District
Court of Ramsey County in which jurisdiction is proper to enjoin the act or practice and to enforce
compliance with the statute, rule, or order. On a showing that a person has engaged in or is about
to engage in an act or practice that constitutes a violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board
has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the court shall grant a permanent or temporary
injunction, restraining order, or other appropriate relief.

violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce.

registration, or renewal.
    Subd. 3. Cease and desist orders. (a) The board, or complaint committee if authorized by
the board, may issue and have served upon an unlicensed or unregistered person, or a holder of
a license or registration, an order requiring the person to cease and desist from an act or practice
that constitutes a violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is
empowered to enforce. The order must (1) give reasonable notice of the rights of the person named
in the order to request a hearing, and (2) state the reasons for the entry of the order. No order may
be issued under this subdivision until an investigation of the facts has been conducted under section
214.10.
    (b) Service of the order under this subdivision is effective when the order is personally served
on the person or counsel of record, or served by certified mail to the most recent address provided

within 30 days of the close of the contested case hearing. Within 30 days after receiving the report

of the order, the order becomes final and remains in effect until modified or vacated by the board.

or applicant for a license or registration under this chapter, the board may by order deny, refuse to
renew, suspend, temporarily suspend, or revoke the application, license, or registration, censure or
reprimand the person, refuse to permit the person to sit for examination, or refuse to release the
person's examination grades, if the board finds that such an order is in the public interest and that,
based on a preponderance of the evidence presented, the person has:
   (1) violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to
enforce;
    (2) engaged in conduct or acts that are fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest, whether or not the
conduct or acts relate to the practice of a profession regulated by this chapter, if the fraudulent,
deceptive, or dishonest conduct or acts reflect adversely on the person's ability or fitness to engage
in the practice of the profession;
   (3) engaged in conduct or acts that constitute malpractice, are negligent, demonstrate
incompetence, or are otherwise in violation of the standards in the rules of the board, where the

or committed practices that the board, or complaint committee if authorized by the board, has
determined may result or may have resulted in an immediate threat to the public.
    (b) In lieu of or in addition to any remedy under paragraph (a), the board may, as a condition

effect until the board issues a final order in the matter after a hearing, or on agreement between the
board and the licensee or registrant.
    (b) An order under this subdivision may (1) prohibit the licensee or registrant from engaging in
the practice of a profession regulated by the board in whole or in part, as the facts require, and (2)

board for all or part of the cost of (1) the proceedings resulting in disciplinary action authorized
under this section, (2) the imposition of a civil penalty under paragraph (a), or (3) the issuance of
a cease and desist order. The board may impose a fee under this paragraph when the board shows
that the position of the person who has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or
issued or is empowered to enforce is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make
such a fee unjust, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary. Costs under this paragraph include, but
are not limited to, the amount paid by the board for services from the Office of Administrative
Hearings, attorney fees, court reporter costs, witness costs, reproduction of records, board members'
compensation, board staff time, and expenses incurred by board members and staff.

chapter are met. No license or registration may be reinstated until the former licensee or registrant
has completed at least one-half of the suspension period.

    Funds for the purposes of this section are provided by section 298.28, subdivision 11, relating
to the taconite area environmental protection fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 298.227, is amended to read:
   298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    (a) An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production
and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of
the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that producer.
The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each local
employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the employee
committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees. The review
must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal for expenditure
of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be released only for
workforce development and associated public facility improvement, or for acquisition of plant
and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or for research and development
in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology, but only if the
producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at least 50 percent
of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with distributions in 2002. Effective for
proposals for expenditures of money from the fund beginning May 26, 2007, the commissioner
may not release the funds before the next scheduled meeting of the board. If ­h    t­­ ­­

proposed expenditure is not approved by at least seven Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation
Board members, the funds must be deposited in the Taconite Environmental Protection Fund under
sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a producer uses money which has been released from the fund prior
to May 26, 2007 to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and the producer
removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134 within
ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a portion of the money granted from
the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development fund. The portion of the money
to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed from the taconite tax relief

area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund, declining by ten percent for each
of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains within the taconite tax relief
area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the facility had ceased, any money
remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to the purchaser of the facility on the
terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this section. If a producer fails to provide
matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months after the commissioner approves
release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another producer in proportion to the
distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any portion of the fund which is not
released by the commissioner within one year of its deposit in the fund shall be divided between
the taconite environmental protection fund created in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson
economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292 for placement in their respective special
accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds shall be distributed to the taconite environmental
protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund.
    (b)(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), setting the amount of distributions
and the review process, an amount equal to ten cents per taxable ton of production in 2007, for
distribution in 2008 only, that would otherwise be distributed under paragraph (a), may be used for a
loan for the cost of construction of a biomass energy facility. This amount must be deducted from the
distribution under paragraph (a) for which a matching expenditure by the producer is not required.

    (1) to provide loans, loan guarantees, interest buy-downs and other forms of participation with
private sources of financing, but a loan to a private enterprise shall be for a principal amount not
to exceed one-half of the cost of the project for which financing is sought, and the rate of interest
on a loan to a private enterprise shall be no less than the lesser of eight percent or an interest rate
three percentage points less than a full faith and credit obligation of the United States government

    (2) to fund reserve accounts established to secure the payment when due of the principal of and
interest on bonds issued pursuant to section 298.2211;

employee, or owner of an interest in the entity that exceeds ten percent of the value of all interests
in it. For purposes of determining the limitations under this clause, the amount of investments made
by an investor other than the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund is the sum of all
investments made in the venture capital fund or enterprise during the period beginning one year
before the date of the investment by the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund; and

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327C.095, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Change in use, relocation expenses; payments by park owner. (a) If a manufactured
home owner is required to relocate due to the conversion of all or a portion of a manufactured
home park to another use, the closure of a manufactured home park, or cessation of use of the land
as a manufactured home park under subdivision 1, and the manufactured home owner complies
with the requirements of this section, the manufactured home owner is entitled to payment from
the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund equal to the manufactured home owner's
actual relocation costs for relocating the manufactured home to a new location within a 25-mile
radius of the park that is being closed, up to a maximum of $4,000 for a single-section and $8,000
for a multisection manufactured home. The actual relocation costs must include the reasonable cost
of taking down, moving, and setting up the manufactured home, including equipment rental, utility
connection and disconnection charges, minor repairs, modifications necessary for transportation of
the home, necessary moving permits and insurance, moving costs for any appurtenances, which
meet applicable local, state, and federal building and construction codes.
   (b) A manufactured home owner is not entitled to compensation under paragraph (a) if the
manufactured home park owner is not required to make a payment to the Minnesota manufactured
home relocation trust fund under subdivision 12, paragraph (b).
   (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e), in order to obtain payment from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, the manufactured home owner shall submit to the
neutral third party and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, with a copy to the park owner, an
application for payment, which includes:
   (1) a copy of the closure statement under subdivision 1;
   (2) a copy of the contract with a moving or towing contractor, which includes the relocation
costs for relocating the manufactured home;
   (3) a statement with supporting materials of any additional relocation costs as outlined in
subdivision 1;
   (4) a statement certifying that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under
subdivision 12, paragraph (b), apply to the manufactured home owner;
    (5) a statement from the manufactured park owner that the lot rental is current and that the annual
$12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been paid when due;
and
   (6) a statement from the county where the manufactured home is located certifying that personal
property taxes for the manufactured home are paid through the end of that year.
    (d) If the neutral third party has acted reasonably and does not approve or deny payment within
45 days after receipt of the information set forth in paragraph (c), the payment is deemed approved.
Upon approval and request by the neutral third party, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall
issue two checks in equal amount for 50 percent of the contract price payable to the mover and
towing contractor for relocating the manufactured home in the amount of the actual relocation cost,
plus a check to the home owner for additional certified costs associated with third-party vendors,
that were necessary in relocating the manufactured home. The moving or towing contractor shall
receive 50 percent upon execution of the contract and 50 percent upon completion of the relocation

and approval by the manufactured home owner. The moving or towing contractor may not apply
the funds to any other purpose other than relocation of the manufactured home as provided in the
contract. A copy of the approval must be forwarded by the neutral third party to the park owner with
an invoice for payment of the amount specified in subdivision 12, paragraph (a).
     (e) In lieu of collecting a relocation payment from the Minnesota manufactured home relocation
trust fund under paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner may collect an amount from the fund
after reasonable efforts to relocate the manufactured home have failed due to the age or condition of
the manufactured home, or because there are no manufactured home parks willing or able to accept
the manufactured home within a 25-mile radius. A manufactured home owner may tender title of
the manufactured home in the manufactured home park to the manufactured home park owner, and
collect an amount to be determined by an independent appraisal. The appraiser must be agreed to
by both the manufactured home park owner and the manufactured home owner. The amount that
may be reimbursed under the fund is a maximum of $5,000 for a single section and $9,000 for a
multisection manufactured home. The manufactured home owner shall deliver to the manufactured
home park owner the current certificate of title to the manufactured home duly endorsed by the
owner of record, and valid releases of all liens shown on the certificate of title, and a statement from
the county where the manufactured home is located evidencing that the personal property taxes have
been paid. The manufactured home owner's application for funds under this paragraph must include
a document certifying that the manufactured home cannot be relocated, that the lot rental is current,
that the annual $12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been
paid when due, that the manufactured home owner has chosen to tender title under this section,
and that the park owner agrees to make a payment to the commissioner of finance in the amount
established in subdivision 12, paragraph (a), less any documented costs submitted to the neutral
third party, required for demolition and removal of the home, and any debris or refuse left on the
lot, not to exceed $1,000. The manufactured home owner must also provide a copy of the certificate
of title endorsed by the owner of record, and certify to the neutral third party, with a copy to the
park owner, that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under subdivision 12, paragraph
(b), clauses (1) to (6), apply to the manufactured home owner, and that the home owner will vacate
the home within 60 days after receipt of payment or the date of park closure, whichever is earlier,
provided that the monthly lot rent is kept current.
    (f) The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency must make a determination of the amount of
payment a manufactured home owner would have been entitled to under a local ordinance in effect
on May 26, 2007. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner's compensation
for relocation costs from the fund under section 462A.35, is the greater of the amount provided
under this subdivision, or the amount under the local ordinance in effect on May 26, 2007, that is
applicable to the manufactured home owner. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to increase the
liability of the park owner.
    (g) Neither the neutral third party nor the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall be liable
to any person for recovery if the funds in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund
are insufficient to pay the amounts claimed. The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall keep a
record of the time and date of its approval of payment to a claimant.
    (h) The agency shall report to the chairs of the senate Finance Committee and house of
representatives Ways and Means Committee by January 15 of each year on the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, including the account balance, payments to claimants,

the amount of any advances to the fund, ­

                                         ­d­ the amount of any insufficiencies encountered during
the previous calendar year, and any administrative charges or expenses deducted from the trust
fund balance. If sufficient funds become available, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall
pay the manufactured home owner whose unpaid claim is the earliest by time and date of approval.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462A.05, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Rehabilitation loans. It may agree to purchase, make, or otherwise participate in the
making, and may enter into commitments for the purchase, making, or participation in the making,
of eligible loans for rehabilitation, with terms and conditions as the agency deems advisable, to
persons and families of low and moderate income, and to owners of existing residential housing
for occupancy by such persons and families, for the rehabilitation of existing residential housing
owned by them. The loans may be insured or uninsured and may be made with security, or may be
unsecured, as the agency deems advisable. The loans may be in addition to or in combination with
long-term eligible mortgage loans under subdivision 3. They may be made in amounts sufficient
to refinance existing indebtedness secured by the property, if refinancing is determined by the
agency to be necessary to permit the owner to meet the owner's housing cost without expending
an unreasonable portion of the owner's income thereon. No loan for rehabilitation shall be made
unless the agency determines that the loan will be used primarily to make the housing more
desirable to live in, to increase the market value of the housing, for compliance with state, county
or municipal building, housing maintenance, fire, health or similar codes and standards applicable
to housing, or to accomplish energy conservation related improvements. In unincorporated areas
and municipalities not having codes and standards, the agency may, solely for the purpose of
administering the provisions of this chapter, establish codes and standards. Except for accessibility
improvements under this subdivision and subdivisions 14a and 24, clause (1), no secured loan for
rehabilitation of any owner-occupied property shall be made in an amount which, with all other
existing indebtedness secured by the property, would exceed 110 percent of its market value, as
determined by the agency. No loan under this subdivision for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied
housing shall be denied solely because the loan will not be used for placing the owner-occupied
residential housing in full compliance with all state, county, or municipal building, housing
maintenance, fire, health, or similar codes and standards applicable to housing. Rehabilitation loans
shall be made only when the agency determines that financing is not otherwise available, in whole
or in part, from private lenders upon equivalent terms and conditions. Accessibility rehabilitation
loans authorized under this subdivision may be made to eligible persons and families without
limitations relating to the maximum incomes of the borrowers if:
    (1) the borrower or a member of the borrower's family requires a level of care provided in
a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities;
   (2) home care is appropriate; and
    (3) the improvement will enable the borrower or a member of the borrower's family to reside in
the housing.
The agency may waive any requirement that the housing units in a residential housing development
be rented to persons of low and moderate income if the development consists of four or less dwelling
units, one of which is occupied by the owner.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462A.05, subdivision 14a, is amended to read:
4440                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [50TH DAY

    Subd. 14a. Rehabilitation loans; existing owner occupied residential housing. It may make
loans to persons and families of low and moderate income to rehabilitate or to assist in rehabilitating
existing residential housing owned and occupied by those persons or families. No loan shall be
made unless the agency determines that the loan will be used primarily for rehabilitation work
necessary for health or safety, essential accessibility improvements, or to improve the energy
efficiency of the dwelling. No loan for rehabilitation of owner occupied residential housing
shall be denied solely because the loan will not be used for placing the residential housing in
full compliance with all state, county or municipal building, housing maintenance, fire, health
or similar codes and standards applicable to housing. The amount of any loan shall not exceed
the lesser of (a) a maximum loan amount determined under rules adopted by the agency not to
exceed ­$2  ,­ 0
           ­­0
          ­0   ­0
                ­ $27,000, or (b) the actual cost of the work performed, or (c) that portion of the
cost of rehabilitation which the agency determines cannot otherwise be paid by the person or
family without the expenditure of an unreasonable portion of the income of the person or family.
Loans made in whole or in part with federal funds may exceed the maximum loan amount to the
extent necessary to comply with federal lead abatement requirements prescribed by the funding
source. In making loans, the agency shall determine the circumstances under which and the terms
and conditions under which all or any portion of the loan will be repaid and shall determine the
appropriate security for the repayment of the loan. Loans pursuant to this subdivision may be made
with or without interest or periodic payments.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.201, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. City. "City" means a city of the first class as defined in section 410.01 ­

second class that is designated as an economically depressed area by the United States Department
of Commerce, and a statutory or home rule charter city, town, or township. For each city, a port
authority, housing and redevelopment authority, or other agency or instrumentality, the jurisdiction
of which is the territory of the city, is included within the meaning of city.

    Subd. 4. City matching money. (a) "City matching money" means the money of a city specified
in a targeted revitalization program. The sources of city matching money may include:
    (1) money from the general fund or a special fund of a city used to implement a targeted
revitalization program;

federal government, a profit or nonprofit corporation, or another entity or individual, that is to be

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 580.07, is amended to read:
   580.07 POSTPONEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Postponement by mortgagee. The sale may be postponed, from time to time,
by the party conducting the foreclosure, by inserting a notice of the postponement, as soon as
practicable, in the newspaper in which the original advertisement was published, at the expense
of the party requesting the postponement. The notice shall be published only once.
    Subd. 2. Postponement by mortgagor or owner. (a) If all or a part of the property to be sold is
classified as homestead under section 273.124 and contains one to four dwelling units, the mortgagor
or owner may postpone the sale to the first date that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday and is
five months after the originally scheduled date of sale in the manner provided in this subdivision. To
postpone a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision, at any time after the first publication of the
notice of mortgage foreclosure sale under section 580.03 but at least 15 days prior to the scheduled
sale date specified in that notice, the mortgagor shall: (1) execute a sworn affidavit in the form set
forth in subdivision 3, (2) record the affidavit in the office of each county recorder and registrar
of titles where the mortgage was recorded, and (3) file with the sheriff conducting the sale and
deliver to the attorney foreclosing the mortgage, a copy of the recorded affidavit, showing the date
and office in which the affidavit was recorded. Recording of the affidavit and postponement of the
foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision shall automatically reduce the mortgagor's redemption
period under section 580.23 to five weeks. The postponement of a foreclosure sale pursuant to this
subdivision does not require any change in the contents of the notice of sale, service of the notice of
sale if the occupant was served with the notice of sale prior to postponement under this subdivision,
or publication of the notice of sale if publication was commenced prior to postponement under this
subdivision, notwithstanding the service and publication time periods specified in section 580.03,
but the sheriff's certificate of sale shall indicate the actual date of the foreclosure sale and the actual
length of the mortgagor's redemption period. No notice of postponement need be published. An
affidavit complying with subdivision 3 shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and
shall be entitled to be recorded. The right to postpone a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision
may be exercised only once, regardless whether the mortgagor reinstates the mortgage prior to the
postponed mortgage foreclosure sale.

    (b) If the automatic stay under United States Code, title 11, section 362, applies to the mortgage
foreclosure after a mortgagor or owner requests postponement of the sheriff's sale under this
section, then when the automatic stay is no longer applicable, the mortgagor's or owner's election to
shorten the redemption period to five weeks under this section remains applicable to the mortgage
foreclosure.

following form and shall contain all of the following information.

     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 129D.155, is amended to read:
     129D.155 REPAYMENT OF FUNDS.
      State funds distributed to public television or noncommercial radio stations and used to purchase
equipment assets must be repaid to the state, without interest, if the assets purchased with these funds
are sold within five years or otherwise converted to a person other than a nonprofit or municipal
corporation. The amount due to the state shall be the net amount realized from the sale of the
assets, but shall not exceed the amount of state funds advanced for the purchase of the asset. P                           ­u­­

by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), and (13) and reduced by the
Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under section
290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses (9), (10), (14), (15), and (16), after applying the allocation and assignability provisions of
section 290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
   (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), and (13) and reduced by the amounts
specified in section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (1), (9), (10), (14), (15), and (16).
    (f) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013, the maximum tax rate under this
subdivision is 7.85 percent, if the commissioner of finance estimates in the February 2013 economic
forecast that the unrestricted general fund balance at the end of fiscal year 2013 equals or exceeds
$500,000,000.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2008.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.06, subdivision 2d, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2d. Inflation adjustment of brackets. (a) For taxable years beginning after December
31, 2
    ­0­0
       ­0­ 2009, the minimum and maximum dollar amounts for each rate bracket for which a tax
is imposed in subdivision 2c shall be adjusted for inflation by the percentage determined under
paragraph (b). For the purpose of making the adjustment as provided in this subdivision all of the
rate brackets provided in subdivision 2c shall be the rate brackets as they existed for taxable years
beginning after December 31, ­   19

any rate bracket must not be changed. The dollar amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted to
reflect the changes in the rate brackets. The rate brackets as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest
$10 amount. If the rate bracket ends in $5, it must be rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.
    (b) The commissioner shall adjust the rate brackets and by the percentage determined pursuant
to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that:
    (1) in section 1(f)(2)(A) the words "increasing or decreasing" shall be substituted for the word
"increasing";
      (2) in section 1(f)(3)(A) the words "differs from" shall be substituted for the word "exceeds";

    Subdivision 1. Persons authorized to perform marriages. Marriages may be solemnized
throughout the state by an individual who has attained the age of 21 years and is a judge of a court
of record, a retired judge of a court of record, a court administrator, a retired court administrator
with the approval of the chief judge of the judicial district, a former court commissioner who
is employed by the court system or is acting pursuant to an order of the chief judge of the
commissioner's judicial district, the residential school administrators of the Minnesota State
Academy for the Deaf and the Minnesota State Academy for the Blind, a licensed or ordained
minister of any religious denomination, or by any mode recognized in section 517.18.
    Subd. 2. Solemnization requirements. A marriage may be solemnized only if it is between a
man and a woman, both of whom the person solemnizing the marriage believes to be capable in law
of contracting marriage, to which the parties have consented. Lawful marriage may be solemnized
only between persons of the opposite sex and only when a license has been obtained as provided
by law and the marriage is contracted in the presence of two witnesses and solemnized by one
authorized, or whom one or both of the parties in good faith believe to be authorized, to do so. A
person authorized to perform marriages may not solemnize a marriage between persons of the same
sex."

                    EXECUTIVE AND OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS

   The following communication was received.
                                                                                       May 8, 2009
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear Senator Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 122, Chapter 47, a bill requiring retailers to post a
warning regarding the effect of unprocessed cocoa bean mulch on pets.
Many of us are pet lovers and will go to considerable lengths to care for and protect our pets. This
legislation is well intended, but it is an example of legislative overreach.
According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' Animal Poison Control
Center, there are only a small number of cocoa bean mulch ingestion incidents each year. Very few
result in death.
Many household and outdoor items are harmful to pets if ingested. Retailers are generally not
required to post warnings at the point of purchase for those products.
I share the goal that we should take reasonable precautions to protect our pets. However, it is
unreasonable to ask all retailers to post signs at the point of purchase for such products. A better
approach would be to require manufacturers to post warning labels on the products themselves,
where necessary and appropriate. We should also supplement efforts to protect our pets by raising
public awareness regarding products that are potentially harmful to them.
Additionally, the bill language is unclear regarding the extent a business would be liable for not
properly displaying warning signs.
I sincerely appreciate the intentions and efforts of the legislators and advocates who supported this
50TH DAY]                            FRIDAY, MAY 8, 2009                                     4473

legislation. I hope we can find other ways to advocate for the safety of our pets.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 122 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.
