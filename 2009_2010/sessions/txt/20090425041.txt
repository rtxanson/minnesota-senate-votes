representative, or the nursing facility or boarding care home may request that the commissioner of
health reconsider the assigned reimbursement classification. The request for reconsideration must
be submitted in writing to the commissioner within 30 days of the day the resident or the resident's
representative receives the resident classification notice. The request for reconsideration must
include the name of the resident, the name and address of the facility in which the resident resides,
the reasons for the reconsideration, the requested classification changes, and documentation
supporting the requested classification. The documentation accompanying the reconsideration
request is limited to documentation which establishes that the needs of the resident at the time of
the assessment justify a classification which is different than the classification established by the
commissioner of health.
    (b) Upon request, the nursing facility must give the resident or the resident's representative a
copy of the assessment form and the other documentation that was given to the commissioner of
health to support the assessment findings. The nursing facility shall also provide access to and a copy
of other information from the resident's record that has been requested by or on behalf of the resident
to support a resident's reconsideration request. A copy of any requested material must be provided
within three working days of receipt of a written request for the information. If a facility fails to
provide the material within this time, it is subject to the issuance of a correction order and penalty
assessment under sections 144.653 and 144A.10. Notwithstanding those sections, any correction
order issued under this subdivision must require that the nursing facility immediately comply with
the request for information and that as of the date of the issuance of the correction order, the facility
shall forfeit to the state a $100 fine for the first day of noncompliance, and an increase in the $100
fine by $50 increments for each day the noncompliance continues.
    (c) In addition to the information required under paragraphs (a) and (b), a reconsideration request
from a nursing facility must contain the following information: (i) the date the reimbursement
classification notices were received by the facility; (ii) the date the classification notices were
distributed to the resident or the resident's representative; and (iii) a copy of a notice sent to the
resident or to the resident's representative. This notice must inform the resident or the resident's

representative that a reconsideration of the resident's classification is being requested, the reason
for the request, that the resident's rate will change if the request is approved by the commissioner,
the extent of the change, that copies of the facility's request and supporting documentation are
available for review, and that the resident also has the right to request a reconsideration. If the
facility fails to provide the required information with the reconsideration request, the request
must be denied, and the facility may not make further reconsideration requests on that specific
reimbursement classification.
    (d) Reconsideration by the commissioner must be made by individuals not involved in
reviewing the assessment, audit, or reconsideration that established the disputed classification. The
reconsideration must be based upon the initial assessment and upon the information provided to the
commissioner under paragraphs (a) and (b). If necessary for evaluating the reconsideration request,
the commissioner may conduct on-site reviews. Within 15 working days of receiving the request
for reconsideration, the commissioner shall affirm or modify the original resident classification.
The original classification must be modified if the commissioner determines that the assessment
resulting in the classification did not accurately reflect the needs or assessment characteristics of
the resident at the time of the assessment. The resident and the nursing facility or boarding care
home shall be notified within five working days after the decision is made. A decision by the
commissioner under this subdivision is the final administrative decision of the agency for the party
requesting reconsideration.
    (e) The resident classification established by the commissioner shall be the classification
that applies to the resident while the request for reconsideration is pending. If a request for
reconsideration applies to an assessment used to determine nursing facility level of care under
subdivision 4, paragraph (c), the resident shall continue to be eligible for nursing facility level of
care while the request for reconsideration is pending.

need is not required for a change in ownership at the same address.
    (c) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the moratorium established in
paragraph (a), that are in the process of receiving an adult or child foster care license as of July 1,

   (1) participants have made decisions to move into the residential setting, including
documentation in each participant's care plan;
   (2) the provider has purchased housing or has made a financial investment in the property;
    (3) the lead agency has approved the plans, including costs for the residential setting for each
individual;
   (4) the completion of the licensing process, including all necessary inspections, is the only
remaining component prior to being able to provide services; and
   (5) the needs of the individuals cannot be met within the existing capacity in that county.
To qualify for the process under this paragraph, the lead agency must submit documentation to the

   i­­e price and other information requested by the commissioner of human services regarding
rents and services. The commissioners of human services and health shall align the data elements
required by this section, and section 144G.06, the Uniform Consumer Information Guide, to
provide consumers standardized information and ease of comparison of long-term care options.
The commissioner of human services shall provide the data to the Minnesota Board on Aging for
inclusion in the MinnesotaHelp.info network long-term care database;
     (10) provide long-term care options counseling. Long-term care options counselors shall:
    (i) for individuals not eligible for case management under a public program or public funding
source, provide interactive decision support under which consumers, family members, or other
helpers are supported in their deliberations to determine appropriate long-term care choices in
the context of the consumer's needs, preferences, values, and individual circumstances, including
implementing a community support plan;
   (ii) provide Web-based educational information and collateral written materials to familiarize
consumers, family members, or other helpers with the long-term care basics, issues to be considered,
and the range of options available in the community;
  (iii) provide long-term care futures planning, which means providing assistance to individuals
who anticipate having long-term care needs to develop a plan for the more distant future; and
   (iv) provide expertise in benefits and financing options for long-term care, including Medicare,
long-term care insurance, tax or employer-based incentives, reverse mortgages, private pay options,
and ways to access low or no-cost services or benefits through volunteer-based or charitable
programs; and
   (11) using risk management and support planning protocols, provide long-term care options
counseling to prospective residents of housing with services establishments registered under chapter
144D and current residents of nursing homes deemed appropriate for discharge by the commissioner.
In order to meet this requirement, the commissioner shall provide designated Senior LinkAge
Line contact centers with a list of nursing home residents appropriate for discharge planning via a
secure Web portal. Senior LinkAge Line shall provide these residents, if they indicate a preference
to receive long-term care options counseling, with initial assessment, review of risk factors,
independent living support consultation, or referral to:
     (i) services under section 256B.0911, subdivision 3;
    (ii) designated care coordinators of contracted entities under section 256B.035 for persons who
are enrolled in a managed care plan; or
   (iii) the long-term care consultation team for those who are appropriate for relocation service
coordination due to high-risk factors or psychological or physical disability.

recipient enrolled in managed care experiences a temporary disenrollment from a health plan, the
commissioner shall accept the current health plan authorization for personal care assistance services
for up to 60 days. The request must be received within the first 30 days of the disenrollment. If the
recipient's reenrollment in managed care is after the 60 days and before 90 days, the provider shall
request an additional 30-day extension of the current health plan authorization, for a total limit of
90 days from the time of disenrollment.

are cooperatively applying for home care services under the community alternative care program
developed under section 256B.49, or until it is determined by the appropriate regulatory agency
that a health benefit plan is or is not required to pay for appropriate medically necessary health care
services. Recipients or their representatives must cooperatively assist the commissioner in obtaining
this determination. Recipients who are eligible for the community alternative care program may not

    (i) The commissioner shall provide a rate methodology for shared private duty nursing. For two
persons sharing nursing care, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed 1.5 times the regular private
duty nursing rates paid for serving a single individual by a registered nurse or licensed practical
nurse. These rates apply only to situations in which both recipients are present and receive shared
private duty nursing care on the date for which the service is billed.
    Subd. 4. Hardship criteria; private duty nursing. (a) Payment is allowed for extraordinary
services that require specialized nursing skills and are provided by parents of minor children,
spouses, and legal guardians who are providing private duty nursing care under the following
conditions:
   (1) the provision of these services is not legally required of the parents, spouses, or legal
guardians;
     (2) the services are necessary to prevent hospitalization of the recipient; and
   (3) the recipient is eligible for state plan home care or a home and community-based waiver and
one of the following hardship criteria are met:
   (i) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian resigns from a part-time or full-time job to provide
nursing care for the recipient; ­
                                o­r
   (ii) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian goes from a full-time to a part-time job with less
compensation to provide nursing care for the recipient; ­
                                                        o­r
    (iii) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian takes a leave of absence without pay to provide nursing
care for the recipient; or
    (iv) because of labor conditions, special language needs, or intermittent hours of care needed,
the parent, spouse, or legal guardian is needed in order to provide adequate private duty nursing
services to meet the medical needs of the recipient.
   (b) Private duty nursing may be provided by a parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal
guardian who is a nurse licensed in Minnesota. Private duty nursing services provided by a parent,
spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian cannot be used in lieu of nursing services covered and
available under liable third-party payors, including Medicare. The private duty nursing provided
by a parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian must be included in the service ­    p­a

residence and provided by the parent, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian may not exceed
50 percent of the total approved nursing hours, or eight hours per day, whichever is less, up to a
maximum of 40 hours per week. A parent or parents, spouse, family foster parent, or legal guardian
shall not provide more than 40 hours of services in a seven-day period. For parents, family foster
parents, and legal guardians, 40 hours is the total amount allowed regardless of the number of
children or adults who receive services. Nothing in this subdivision precludes the parent's, spouse's,
or legal guardian's obligation of assuming the nonreimbursed family responsibilities of emergency
backup caregiver and primary caregiver.
    (c) A parent, family foster parent, or a spouse may not be paid to provide private duty nursing
care if:
     (1) the parent or spouse fails to pass a criminal background check according to chapter 245C,

    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0655, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
     Subd. 1b. Assessment. "Assessment" means a review and evaluation of a recipient's need for

determination of need, evaluation of service effectiveness, identification of appropriate services,
service plan development or modification, coordination of services, referrals and follow-up to
appropriate payers and community resources, completion of required reports, recommendation of
service authorization, and consumer education. Once the need for personal care assistant services
is determined under this section or sections 256B.0651, 256B.0653, 256B.0654, and 256B.0656,
the county public health nurse or certified public health nurse under contract with the county is
responsible for communicating this recommendation to the commissioner and the recipient. A                                   ­

there is a change in the need for personal care assistant services. A service update may substitute
for the annual face-to-face assessment when there is not a significant change in recipient condition
or a change in the need for personal care assistant service. A service update may be completed
by telephone, used when there is no need for an increase in personal care assistant services, and
used for two consecutive assessments if followed by a face-to-face assessment. A service update
must be completed on a form approved by the commissioner. A service update or review for
temporary increase includes a review of initial baseline data, evaluation of service effectiveness,

                                             t assistance services authorized must be based on the
recipient's home care rating. The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or
the commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner identifying the
following:
      (1) total number of dependencies of activities of daily living as defined in section 256B.0659;
      (2) number of complex health-related functions as defined in section 256B.0659; and
      (3) number of behavior descriptions as defined in section 256B.0659.
    (c) The methodology to determine total time for personal care assistance services for each home
care rating is based on the median paid units per day for each home care rating from fiscal year
2007 data for the personal care assistance program. Each home care rating has a base level of hours
assigned. Additional time is added through the assessment and identification of the following:
    (1) 30 additional minutes per day for a dependency in each critical activity of daily living as
defined in section 256B.0659;
   (2) 30 additional minutes per day for each complex health-related function as defined in section
256B.0659; and
      (3) 30 additional minutes per day for each behavior issue as defined in section 256B.0659.
    (d) A limit of 96 units of qualified professional supervision may be authorized for each recipient
receiving personal care assistance services. A request to the commissioner to exceed this total in a
calendar year must be requested by the personal care provider agency on a form approved by the
commissioner.

    Subd. 15. Flexible use. (a) "Flexible use" means the scheduled use of authorized hours of
personal care assistance services, which vary within a service authorization period covering no
more than six months, in order to more effectively meet the needs and schedule of the recipient.
Each 12-month service agreement is divided into two six-month authorization date spans. No more
than 75 percent of the total authorized units for a 12-month service agreement may be used in a
six-month date span.
    (b) Authorization of flexible use occurs during the authorization process under section
256B.0652. The flexible use of authorized hours does not increase the total amount of authorized
hours available to a recipient. The commissioner shall not authorize additional personal care
assistance services to supplement a service authorization that is exhausted before the end date
under a flexible service use plan, unless the assessor determines a change in condition and a need
for increased services is established. Authorized hours not used within the six-month period must
not be carried over to another time period.
    (c) A recipient who has terminated personal care assistance services before the end of the
12-month authorization period must not receive additional hours upon reapplying during the same

be prorated for the remainder of the 12-month authorization period based on the first six-month
assessment.
   (d) The recipient, responsible party, and qualified professional must develop a written
month-to-month plan of the projected use of personal care assistance services that is part of the
personal care assistance care plan and ensures:
   (1) that the health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of the
2812                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

authorization period; and
    (2) that the total authorized amount of personal care assistance services for each date span must
not be used before the end of each date span in the authorization period.
    (e) The personal care assistance provider agency shall monitor the use of personal care assistance
services to ensure health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of
the authorization period. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall provide written
notice to the provider and the recipient or responsible party when a recipient is at risk of exceeding
the personal care assistance services prior to the end of the six-month period.
    (f) Misuse and abuse of the flexible use of personal care assistance services resulting in the
overuse of units in a manner where the recipient will not have enough units to meet their needs for
assistance and ensure health and safety for the entire six-month date span may lead to an action by
the commissioner. The commissioner may take action including, but not limited to: (1) restricting
recipients to service authorizations of no more than one month in duration; (2) requiring the recipient
to have a responsible party; and (3) requiring a qualified professional to monitor and report services
on a monthly basis.
    Subd. 16. Shared services. (a) Medical assistance payments for shared personal care assistance
services are limited according to this subdivision.

   (1) the home residence or family foster care home of one or more of the individual recipients; or
    (2) a child care program licensed under chapter 245A or operated by a local school district or
private school.
   (d) Shared personal care assistance services follow the same criteria for covered services as
subdivision 2.
   (e) Noncovered shared personal care assistance services include the following:
   (1) services for more than three recipients by one personal care assistant at one time;
   (2) staff requirements for child care programs under chapter 245C;
   (3) caring for multiple recipients in more than one setting;
   (4) additional units of personal care assistance based on the selection of the option; and
   (5) use of more than one personal care assistance provider agency for the shared care services.
    (f) The option of shared personal care assistance is elected by the recipient or the responsible
party with the assistance of the assessor. The option must be determined appropriate based on the
ages of the recipients, compatibility, and coordination of their assessed care needs. The recipient or
the responsible party, in conjunction with the qualified professional, shall arrange the setting and
grouping of shared services based on the individual needs and preferences of the recipients. The
41ST DAY]                           SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                          2813

personal care assistance provider agency shall offer the recipient or the responsible party the option
of shared or one-on-one personal care assistance services or a combination of both. The recipient or
the responsible party may withdraw from participating in a shared services arrangement at any time.
    (g) Authorization for the shared service option must be determined by the commissioner based
on the criteria that the shared service is appropriate to meet all of the recipients' needs and their health
and safety is maintained. The authorization of shared services is part of the overall authorization of
personal care assistance services. Nothing in this subdivision must be construed to reduce the total
number of hours authorized for an individual recipient.
   (h) A personal care assistant providing shared personal care assistance services must:
   (1) receive training specific for each recipient served; and
   (2) follow all required documentation requirements for time and services provided.
   (i) A qualified professional shall:
    (1) evaluate the ability of the personal care assistant to provide services for all of the recipients
in a shared setting;
    (2) visit the shared setting as services are being provided at least once every six months or

assistance staff;
   (3) provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the
shared services;
    (4) develop a contingency plan with each of the recipients which accounts for absence of the
recipient in a share services setting due to illness or other circumstances;
   (5) obtain permission from each of the recipients who are sharing a personal care assistant for
number of shared hours for services provided inside and outside the home residence; and
   (6) document the training completed by the personal care assistants specific to the shared setting
and recipients sharing services.
    Subd. 17. Shared services; rates. The commissioner shall provide a rate system for shared
personal care assistance services. For two persons sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must
not exceed one and one-half times the rate paid for serving a single individual, and for three persons
sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed twice the rate paid for serving a single
individual. These rates apply only when all of the criteria for the shared care personal care assistance
service have been met.
    Subd. 18. Personal care assistance choice option; generally. (a) The commissioner may allow
a recipient of personal care assistance services to use a fiscal intermediary to assist the recipient in
paying and accounting for medically necessary covered personal care assistance services. Unless

care assistance services apply to a recipient using the personal care assistance choice option.
    (b) Personal care assistance choice is an option of the personal care assistance program that
allows the recipient who receives personal care assistance services to be responsible for the hiring,

choice provider agency as a fiscal intermediary. This personal care assistance choice provider agency
manages payroll, invoices the state, is responsible for all payroll related taxes and insurance, and

facility for persons with developmental disabilities who request or are referred for assistance.
Transition assistance must include assessment, community support plan development, referrals to
long-term care options counseling under section 256B.975, subdivision 10, for community support
plan implementation and to Minnesota health care programs, and referrals to programs that provide
assistance with housing. Transition assistance must also include information about the Centers for
Independent Living and the Senior LinkAge Line, and about other organizations that can provide
assistance with relocation efforts, and information about contacting these organizations to obtain
their assistance and support.
   (b) The county shall develop transition processes with institutional social workers and discharge
planners to ensure that:
     (1) persons admitted to facilities receive information about transition assistance that is available;
   (2) the assessment is completed for persons within ten working days of the date of request or
recommendation for assessment; and
    (3) there is a plan for transition and follow-up for the individual's return to the community. The
plan must require notification of other local agencies when a person who may require assistance is
screened by one county for admission to a facility located in another county.
    (c) If a person who is eligible for a Minnesota health care program is admitted to a nursing
facility, the nursing facility must include a consultation team member or the case manager in the
discharge planning process.

applicants to Medicaid certified nursing facilities, including certified boarding care facilities, must
be screened prior to admission regardless of income, assets, or funding sources for nursing facility
care, except as described in subdivision 4b. The purpose of the screening is to determine the need
for nursing facility level of care as described in paragraph (d) and to complete activities required
under federal law related to mental illness and developmental disability as outlined in paragraph (b).
    (b) A person who has a diagnosis or possible diagnosis of mental illness or developmental
disability must receive a preadmission screening before admission regardless of the exemptions
outlined in subdivision 4b, paragraph (b), to identify the need for further evaluation and specialized

services, unless the admission prior to screening is authorized by the local mental health authority
or the local developmental disabilities case manager, or unless authorized by the county agency
according to Public Law 101-508.
     The following criteria apply to the preadmission screening:
    (1) the county must use forms and criteria developed by the commissioner to identify persons
who require referral for further evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services;
and
     (2) the evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services must be done by:
   (i) a qualified independent mental health professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of a serious mental illness; or
    (ii) a qualified developmental disability professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of developmental disability. For purposes of this requirement, a qualified developmental
disability professional must meet the standards for a qualified developmental disability professional
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.430.
    (c) The local county mental health authority or the state developmental disability authority under
Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508 may prohibit admission to a nursing facility if the
individual does not meet the nursing facility level of care criteria or needs specialized services as
defined in Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508. For purposes of this section, "specialized
services" for a person with developmental disability means active treatment as that term is defined
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.440 (a)(1).
    (d) The determination of the need for nursing facility level of care must be made according to
criteria established in sections 144.0724, subdivision 11, and 256B.092, using forms developed by
the commissioner. In assessing a person's needs, consultation team members shall have a physician
available for consultation and shall consider the assessment of the individual's attending physician,
if any. The individual's physician must be included if the physician chooses to participate. Other
personnel may be included on the team as deemed appropriate by the county.

     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Payment for long-term care consultation services. (a) The total payment for each
county must be paid monthly by certified nursing facilities in the county. The monthly amount to

be paid by each nursing facility for each fiscal year must be determined by dividing the county's
annual allocation for long-term care consultation services by 12 to determine the monthly payment
and allocating the monthly payment to each nursing facility based on the number of licensed beds
in the nursing facility. Payments to counties in which there is no certified nursing facility must be
made by increasing the payment rate of the two facilities located nearest to the county seat.
    (b) The commissioner shall include the total annual payment determined under paragraph (a)
for each nursing facility reimbursed under section 256B.431 or 256B.434 according to section
256B.431, subdivision 2b, paragraph (g).
    (c) In the event of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway of 25
percent or more of the beds in a facility, the commissioner may adjust the per diem payment amount
in paragraph (b) and may adjust the monthly payment amount in paragraph (a). The effective date
of an adjustment made under this paragraph shall be on or after the first day of the month following
the effective date of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway.
   (d) Payments for long-term care consultation services are available to the county or counties to
cover staff salaries and expenses to provide the services described in subdivision 1a. The county
shall employ, or contract with other agencies to employ, within the limits of available funding,
sufficient personnel to provide long-term care consultation services while meeting the state's
long-term care outcomes and objectives as defined in section 256B.0917, subdivision 1. The
county shall be accountable for meeting local objectives as approved by the commissioner in the
biennial home and community-based services quality assurance plan on a form provided by the
commissioner.
   (e) Notwithstanding section 256B.0641, overpayments attributable to payment of the screening
costs under the medical assistance program may not be recovered from a facility.
    (f) The commissioner of human services shall amend the Minnesota medical assistance plan to
include reimbursement for the local consultation teams.
    (g) The county may bill, as case management services, assessments, support planning, and
follow-along provided to persons determined to be eligible for case management under Minnesota
health care programs. No individual or family member shall be charged for an initial assessment or
initial support plan development provided under subdivision 3a or 3b.
   (h) The commissioner shall develop an alternative payment methodology for long-term care
consultation services that includes the funding available under this subdivision, and sections
256B.092 and 256B.0659. In developing the new payment methodology, the commissioner shall
consider the maximization of federal funding for this activity.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Reimbursement for certified nursing facilities. (a) Medical assistance reimbursement
for nursing facilities shall be authorized for a medical assistance recipient only if a preadmission
screening has been conducted prior to admission or the county has authorized an exemption. Medical
assistance reimbursement for nursing facilities shall not be provided for any recipient who the local
screener has determined does not meet the level of care criteria for nursing facility placement in
section 144.0724, subdivision 11, or, if indicated, has not had a level II OBRA evaluation as required
under the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 completed unless an admission for a

recipient with mental illness is approved by the local mental health authority or an admission for a
recipient with developmental disability is approved by the state developmental disability authority.
    (b) The nursing facility must not bill a person who is not a medical assistance recipient
for resident days that preceded the date of completion of screening activities as required under
subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c. The nursing facility must include unreimbursed resident days in the
nursing facility resident day totals reported to the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0913, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility for funding for services for nonmedical assistance recipients. (a) Funding
for services under the alternative care program is available to persons who meet the following
criteria:
    (1) the person has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911 to be
a person who would require the level of care provided in a nursing facility, but for the provision of
services under the alternative care program. Effective January 1, 2011, this determination must be
made according to the criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11;
   (2) the person is age 65 or older;
    (3) the person would be eligible for medical assistance within 135 days of admission to a nursing
facility;
    (4) the person is not ineligible for the payment of long-term care services by the medical
assistance program due to an asset transfer penalty under section 256B.0595 or equity interest in
the home exceeding $500,000 as stated in section 256B.056;
   (5) the person needs long-term care services that are not funded through other state or federal
funding;
    (6) except for individuals described in clause (7), the monthly cost of the alternative care services
funded by the program for this person does not exceed 75 percent of the monthly limit described
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a. This monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care
client from payment for additional services, but in no case may the cost of additional services
purchased under this section exceed the difference between the client's monthly service limit defined
under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3, and the alternative care program monthly service limit
defined in this paragraph. If care-related supplies and equipment or environmental modifications
and adaptations are or will be purchased for an alternative care services recipient, the costs may be
prorated on a monthly basis for up to 12 consecutive months beginning with the month of purchase. If
the monthly cost of a recipient's other alternative care services exceeds the monthly limit established
in this paragraph, the annual cost of the alternative care services shall be determined. In this event,
the annual cost of alternative care services shall not exceed 12 times the monthly limit described in
this paragraph; ­an

subdivision 3a, paragraph (a), with (i) no dependencies in activities of daily living, (ii) only one
dependency in bathing, dressing, grooming, or walking, or (iii) a dependency score of less than
three if eating is the only dependency as determined by an assessment performed under section

256B.0911, the monthly cost of alternative care services funded by the program cannot exceed $600
per month for all new participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1, 2009. This monthly
limit shall be applied to all other participants who meet this criteria at reassessment. This monthly
limit shall be increased annually as described in section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a, paragraph (a).
This monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services,
but in no case may the cost of additional services purchased exceed the difference between the
client's monthly service limit defined in this clause and the limit described in clause (6) for case mix
classification A; and
     (8) the person is making timely payments of the assessed monthly fee.
A person is ineligible if payment of the fee is over 60 days past due, unless the person agrees to:
     (i) the appointment of a representative payee;
     (ii) automatic payment from a financial account;
     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
     (iv) another method acceptable to the lead agency to ensure prompt fee payments.
    The lead agency may extend the client's eligibility as necessary while making arrangements to
facilitate payment of past-due amounts and future premium payments. Following disenrollment due
to nonpayment of a monthly fee, eligibility shall not be reinstated for a period of 30 days.
    (b) Alternative care funding under this subdivision is not available for a person who is a medical
assistance recipient or who would be eligible for medical assistance without a spenddown or waiver
obligation. A person whose initial application for medical assistance and the elderly waiver program
is being processed may be served under the alternative care program for a period up to 60 days. If
the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for
services payable under the federally approved elderly waiver plan and delivered from the date the
individual was found eligible for the federally approved elderly waiver plan. Notwithstanding this
provision, alternative care funds may not be used to pay for any service the cost of which: (i) is
payable by medical assistance; (ii) is used by a recipient to meet a waiver obligation; or (iii) is used
to pay a medical assistance income spenddown for a person who is eligible to participate in the
federally approved elderly waiver program under the special income standard provision.
    (c) Alternative care funding is not available for a person who resides in a licensed nursing home,
certified boarding care home, hospital, or intermediate care facility, except for case management
services which are provided in support of the discharge planning process for a nursing home resident
or certified boarding care home resident to assist with a relocation process to a community-based
setting.
    (d) Alternative care funding is not available for a person whose income is greater than the
maintenance needs allowance under section 256B.0915, subdivision 1d, but equal to or less than
120 percent of the federal poverty guideline effective July 1 in the fiscal year for which alternative
care eligibility is determined, who would be eligible for the elderly waiver with a waiver obligation.

     Subd. 3a. Elderly waiver cost limits. (a) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services
to an individual elderly waiver client except for individuals described in paragraph (b) shall be the
weighted average monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly
waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the
recipient's maintenance needs allowance as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the
first day of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section
256B.438 for nursing home rate determination is implemented. Effective on the first day of the state
fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section 256B.438 for nursing
home rate determination is implemented and the first day of each subsequent state fiscal year, the
monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client shall be the rate
of the case mix resident class to which the waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, in effect on the last day of the previous state fiscal year, adjusted
by the greater of any legislatively adopted home and community-based services percentage rate
increase or the average statewide percentage increase in nursing facility payment rates.
    (b) The monthly limit for the cost of waivered services to an individual elderly waiver client
assigned to a case mix classification A under paragraph (a) with (i) no dependencies in activities
of daily living, (ii) only one dependency in bathing, dressing, grooming, or walking, or (iii) a
dependency score of less than three if eating is the only dependency, shall be the lower of the
case mix classification amount for case mix A as determined under paragraph (a) or the case
mix classification amount for case mix A effective on October 1, 2008, per month for all new
participants enrolled in the program on or after July 1, 2009. This monthly limit shall be applied to
all other participants who meet this criteria at reassessment. This monthly limit shall be increased
annually as described in paragraph (a).
    (c) If extended medical supplies and equipment or environmental modifications are or will be
purchased for an elderly waiver client, the costs may be prorated for up to 12 consecutive months
beginning with the month of purchase. If the monthly cost of a recipient's waivered services exceeds
the monthly limit established in paragraph (a) or (b), the annual cost of all waivered services shall
be determined. In this event, the annual cost of all waivered services shall not exceed 12 times the
monthly limit of waivered services as described in paragraph (a) or (b).

the recipient's community budget cap specified in subdivision 3a. Customized living services must
not include rent or raw food costs.
    (f) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payment rates shall not exceed
the 95 percentile of statewide monthly authorizations for 24-hour customized living services in
effect and in the Medicaid management information systems on March 31, 2009, for each case
mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
   (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
an alternative payment rate system for 24-hour customized living services by approving a single
hourly rate for direct services provided in establishments, which meet the following criteria:
    (1) are registered as housing with services establishments with a capacity of 12 or fewer
residents; and
    (2) are licensed as adult foster care or as a board and lodge establishment.
    Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Assessments and reassessments for waiver clients. (a) Each client shall receive an
initial assessment of strengths, informal supports, and need for services in accordance with section
256B.0911, subdivisions 3, 3a, and 3b. A reassessment of a client served under the elderly waiver
must be conducted at least every 12 months and at other times when the case manager determines
that there has been significant change in the client's functioning. This may include instances where
the client is discharged from the hospital. There must be a determination that the client requires a
nursing facility level of care as defined in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, at initial and subsequent
assessments to initiate and maintain participation in the waiver program.
    (b) Regardless of other assessments identified in section 144.0724, subdivision 4, as appropriate
to determine nursing facility level of care for purposes of medical assistance payment for nursing
facility services, only face-to-face assessments conducted according to section 256B.0911,

    Subd. 10. Waiver payment rates; managed care organizations. The commissioner shall
adjust the elderly waiver capitation payment rates for managed care organizations paid under
section 256B.69, subdivisions 6a and 23, to reflect the maximum service rate limits for customized
living services and 24-hour customized living services under subdivisions 3e and 3h for the
contract period beginning October 1, 2009. Medical assistance rates paid to customized living
providers by managed care organizations under this section shall not exceed the maximum service
rate limits determined by the commissioner under subdivisions 3e and 3h.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0917, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 14. Essential community supports grants. (a) The purpose of the essential community
supports grant program is to provide targeted services to persons 65 years and older who need
essential community support, but whose needs do not meet the level of care required for nursing
facility placement under section 144.0724, subdivision 11.
  (b) Within the limits of the appropriation and not to exceed $400 per person per month, funding
must be available to a person who:
   (1) is age 65 or older;
   (2) is not eligible for medical assistance;
   (3) would otherwise be financially eligible for the alternative care program under section
256B.0913, subdivision 4;
   (4) has received a community assessment under section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a or 3b, and
does not require the level of care provided in a nursing facility;
   (5) has a community support plan; and
    (6) has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a or
3b, to be a person who would require provision of at least one of the following services, as defined
in the approved elderly waiver plan, in order to maintain their community residence:
   (i) caregiver support;
   (ii) homemaker;
   (iii) chore; or
   (iv) a personal emergency response device or system.
    (c) The person receiving any of the essential community supports in this subdivision must also
receive service coordination as part of their community support plan.

    (d) A person who has been determined to be eligible for an essential community support grant
must be reassessed at least annually and continue to meet the criteria in paragraph (b) to remain
eligible for an essential community support grant.
    (e) The commissioner shall allocate grants to counties and tribes under contract with the
department based upon the historic use of the medical assistance elderly waiver and alternative
care grant programs and other criteria as determined by the commissioner.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
      Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, subdivision 8a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8a. County concurrence. (a) If the county of financial responsibility wishes to place a
person in another county for services, the county of financial responsibility shall seek concurrence
from the proposed county of service and the placement shall be made cooperatively between the
two counties. Arrangements shall be made between the two counties for ongoing social service,
including annual reviews of the person's individual service plan. The county where services are
provided may not make changes in the person's service plan without approval by the county of
financial responsibility.
     (b) When a person has been screened and authorized for services in an intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities or for home and community-based services for persons
with developmental disabilities, the case manager shall assist that person in identifying a service
provider who is able to meet the needs of the person according to the person's individual service plan.
If the identified service is to be provided in a county other than the county of financial responsibility,
the county of financial responsibility shall request concurrence of the county where the person is
requesting to receive the identified services. The county of service may refuse to concur if:
    (1) it can demonstrate that the provider is unable to provide the services identified in the person's
individual service plan as services that are needed and are to be provided; or
    (2) in the case of an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
there has been no authorization for admission by the admission review team as required in section

payment limits under this section may be established by the commissioner. Financial disputes
between counties shall be resolved as provided in section 256G.09.
   Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Residential support services. (a) Upon federal approval, there is established a new
service called residential support that is available on the CAC, CADI, DD, and TBI waivers. Existing
waiver service descriptions must be modified to the extent necessary to ensure there is no duplication
between other services. Residential support services must be provided by vendors licensed as a
community residential setting as defined in section 245A.11, subdivision 8.
   (b) Residential support services must meet the following criteria:
   (1) providers of residential support services must own or control the residential site;
   (2) the residential site must not be the primary residence of the license holder;
   (3) the residential site must have a designated program supervisor responsible for program
oversight, development, and implementation of policies and procedures;
    (4) the provider of residential support services must provide supervision, training, and assistance
as described in the person's community support plan; and
   (5) the provider of residential support services must meet the requirements of licensure and
additional requirements of the person's community support plan.
    (c) Providers of residential support services that meet the definition in paragraph (a) must be
registered using a process determined by the commissioner beginning July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 53. [256B.0948] FOSTER CARE RATE LIMITS.
    The commissioner shall decrease by five percent rates for adult foster care and supportive living
services that are reimbursed under section 256B.092 or 256B.49, and are above 95 percent of the
statewide rate for the service. The reduction in rates shall take into account acuity of individuals
served based on the methodology used to allocate dollars to local lead agency budgets. Lead agency
contracts for services specified in this section shall be amended to implement these rate changes for
services rendered on or after July 1, 2009. The commissioner shall make corresponding reductions
to waiver allocations and capitated rates.
   Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.37, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Subrogation. Upon furnishing medical assistance services under this chapter
or alternative care services under section 256B.0913 to any person who has private accident or
health care coverage, or receives or has a right to receive health or medical care from any type of
organization or entity, or has a cause of action arising out of an occurrence that necessitated the
payment of medical assistance, the state agency or the state agency's agent shall be subrogated, to
the extent of the cost of medical care furnished, to any rights the person may have under the terms
of the coverage, or against the organization or entity providing or liable to provide health or medical
care, or under the cause of action.
   The right of subrogation created in this section includes all portions of the cause of action,
notwithstanding any settlement allocation or apportionment that purports to dispose of portions of

the cause of action not subject to subrogation.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
    Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.37, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Private benefits to be used first. Private accident and health care coverage including
Medicare for medical services is primary coverage and must be exhausted before medical assistance
i­ or alternative care services are paid for medical services including home health care, personal
­s
care assistant services, hospice, supplies and equipment, or services covered under a Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services waiver. When a person who is otherwise eligible for medical
assistance has private accident or health care coverage, including Medicare or a prepaid health plan,
the private health care benefits available to the person must be used first and to the fullest extent.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
    Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.434, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Alternate rates for nursing facilities. (a) For nursing facilities which have their
payment rates determined under this section rather than section 256B.431, the commissioner shall
establish a rate under this subdivision. The nursing facility must enter into a written contract with
the commissioner.
    (b) A nursing facility's case mix payment rate for the first rate year of a facility's contract under
this section is the payment rate the facility would have received under section 256B.431.
    (c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a
facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an
inflation adjustment and, for facilities reimbursed under this section or section 256B.431, an
adjustment to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing fees for the facility
taking effect on or after July 1, 2001. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted by
the commissioner of finance's national economic consultant, as forecasted in the fourth quarter of
the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be based on the 12-month
period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the rate year for which the rate
is being determined. For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1999, July 1, 2000, July 1, 2001, July 1,
2002, July 1, 2003, July 1, 2004, July 1, 2005, July 1, 2006, July 1, 2007, July 1, 2008, October 1,

          ­ October 1, 2010, October 1, 2011, October 1, 2012, and October 1, 2013, this paragraph
shall apply only to the property-related payment rate, except that adjustments to include the cost
of any increase in Health Department licensing fees taking effect on or after July 1, 2001, shall
be provided. Beginning in 2005, adjustment to the property payment rate under this section and
section 256B.431 shall be effective on October 1. In determining the amount of the property-related
payment rate adjustment under this paragraph, the commissioner shall determine the proportion of
the facility's rates that are property-related based on the facility's most recent cost report.
    (d) The commissioner shall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent
above a facility's operating payment rate for achieving outcomes specified in a contract. The
commissioner may solicit contract amendments and implement those which, on a competitive
basis, best meet the state's policy objectives. The commissioner shall limit the amount of any
incentive payment and the number of contract amendments under this paragraph to operate the
2838                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [41ST DAY

incentive payments within funds appropriated for this purpose. The contract amendments may
specify various levels of payment for various levels of performance. Incentive payments to facilities
under this paragraph may be in the form of time-limited rate adjustments or onetime supplemental
payments. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria, the commissioner shall
consider the following state policy objectives:
   (1) successful diversion or discharge of residents to the residents' prior home or other
community-based alternatives;
   (2) adoption of new technology to improve quality or efficiency;
   (3) improved quality as measured in the Nursing Home Report Card;
   (4) reduced acute care costs; and
   (5) any additional outcomes proposed by a nursing facility that the commissioner finds desirable.
    (e) Notwithstanding the threshold in section 256B.431, subdivision 16, facilities that take action
to come into compliance with existing or pending requirements of the life safety code provisions or
federal regulations governing sprinkler systems must receive reimbursement for the costs associated
with compliance if all of the following conditions are met:
   (1) the expenses associated with compliance occurred on or after January 1, 2005, and before
December 31, 2008;
   (2) the costs were not otherwise reimbursed under subdivision 4f or section 144A.071 or
144A.073; and
    (3) the total allowable costs reported under this paragraph are less than the minimum threshold
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 15, paragraph (e), and subdivision 16.
The commissioner shall use money appropriated for this purpose to provide to qualifying nursing
facilities a rate adjustment beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30, 2008. Nursing
facilities that have spent money or anticipate the need to spend money to satisfy the most recent life
safety code requirements by (1) installing a sprinkler system or (2) replacing all or portions of an
existing sprinkler system may submit to the commissioner by June 30, 2007, on a form provided by
the commissioner the actual costs of a completed project or the estimated costs, based on a project
bid, of a planned project. The commissioner shall calculate a rate adjustment equal to the allowable
costs of the project divided by the resident days reported for the report year ending September 30,
2006. If the costs from all projects exceed the appropriation for this purpose, the commissioner shall
allocate the money appropriated on a pro rata basis to the qualifying facilities by reducing the rate
adjustment determined for each facility by an equal percentage. Facilities that used estimated costs
when requesting the rate adjustment shall report to the commissioner by January 31, 2009, on the
use of this money on a form provided by the commissioner. If the nursing facility fails to provide the
report, the commissioner shall recoup the money paid to the facility for this purpose. If the facility
reports expenditures allowable under this subdivision that are less than the amount received in the
facility's annualized rate adjustment, the commissioner shall recoup the difference.

(b), for up to 5,140 beds according to clauses (1) to (4):
      (1) the amount available is the net reduction of nursing facility beds multiplied by $2,080;
   (2) the total number of beds in the nursing facility or facilities receiving the planned closure rate
adjustment must be identified;
      (3) capacity days are determined by multiplying the number determined under clause (2) by 365;

days determined under clause (3).
    (b) A planned closure rate adjustment under this section is effective on the first day of the month
following completion of closure of the facility designated for closure in the application and becomes
part of the nursing facility's total operating payment rate.

a new nursing facility or an addition to an existing nursing facility or as an operating payment rate
adjustment. Applications approved under this subdivision are exempt from other requirements for
moratorium exceptions under section 144A.073, subdivisions 2 and 3.
   (d) Upon the request of a closing facility, the commissioner must allow the facility a closure rate
adjustment as provided under section 144A.161, subdivision 10.

facility that is under the same ownership at any time within three years of its effective date. The
amount of the adjustment shall be computed according to paragraph (a).
    (f) If the per bed dollar amount specified in paragraph (a), clause (1), is increased, the
commissioner shall recalculate planned closure rate adjustments for facilities that delicense beds
under this section on or after July 1, 2001, to reflect the increase in the per bed dollar amount. The
recalculated planned closure rate adjustment shall be effective from the date the per bed dollar
amount is increased.
   (g) For planned closures approved after June 30, 2009, the commissioner of human services
shall calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 3,

determination must have been made or confirmed within the previous 12 months. In the case of a
non-English-speaking person: (i) the determination must be made by a qualified professional with
experience conducting culturally appropriate assessments, whenever possible; and (ii) these reports
must include a statement of confidence in the results. If a rehabilitation plan for a participant
extended as learning disabled is developed or approved by the county agency, the plan must

requirement to develop and comply with an employment plan under section 256J.521; or
  (4) a person who has been granted a family violence waiver, and who is complying with an
employment plan under section 256J.521, subdivision 3.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable
employment" means that a qualified professional has determined that the person's condition prevents
the person from working 20 or more hours per week.
    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.425, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Temporary hardship. A participant who has reached the 60-month time limit under
section 256J.42, and does not qualify for an extension under subdivision 2, 3, 4, or 5, may receive
MFIP assistance under a temporary hardship extension between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011.
To receive a temporary hardship extension, the participant must meet the MFIP eligibility criteria
in chapter 256J, except that the requirement that the participant be in compliance in the 60th month
does not apply. Sanction provisions in subdivisions 6 and 7 apply to participants extended under
this subdivision.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.425, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Employed participants. (a) An assistance unit subject to the time limit under section
256J.42, subdivision 1, is eligible to receive assistance under a hardship extension if the participant
who reached the time limit belongs to:
    (1) a one-parent assistance unit in which the participant is participating in work activities for at
least 30 hours per week, of which an average of at least 25 hours per week every month are spent
participating in employment;
     (2) a two-parent assistance unit in which the participants are participating in work activities for
at least 55 hours per week, of which an average of at least 45 hours per week every month are spent
participating in employment; or

    (3) an assistance unit in which a participant is participating in employment for fewer hours than
those specified in clause (1), and the participant submits verification from a qualified professional,
in a form acceptable to the commissioner, stating that the number of hours the participant may
work is limited due to illness or disability, as long as the participant is participating in employment
for at least the number of hours specified by the qualified professional. The participant must be
following the treatment recommendations of the qualified professional providing the verification.
The commissioner shall develop a form to be completed and signed by the qualified professional,
documenting the diagnosis and any additional information necessary to document the functional
limitations of the participant that limit work hours. If the participant is part of a two-parent assistance
unit, the other parent must be treated as a one-parent assistance unit for purposes of meeting the work
requirements under this subdivision.
   (b) For purposes of this section, employment means:
   (1) unsubsidized employment under section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (1);
   (2) subsidized employment under section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (2);
   (3) on-the-job training under section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (2);
   (4) an apprenticeship under section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (1);

employment; or
    (8) unpaid work under section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (3), if it is combined with job
search for up to 12 months in duration.
   (c) If a participant is complying with a child protection plan under chapter 260C, the number of
hours required under the child protection plan count toward the number of hours required under this
subdivision.
    (d) The county shall provide the opportunity for subsidized employment to participants needing
that type of employment within available appropriations.
    (e) To be eligible for a hardship extension for employed participants under this subdivision,
a participant must be in compliance for at least ten out of the 12 months the participant received
MFIP immediately preceding the participant's 61st month on assistance. If ten or fewer months
of eligibility for TANF assistance remain at the time the participant from another state applies for
assistance, the participant must be in compliance every month.
    (f) The employment plan developed under section 256J.521, subdivision 2, for participants under
this subdivision must contain at least the minimum number of hours specified in paragraph (a) for
the purpose of meeting the requirements for an extension under this subdivision. The job counselor
and the participant must sign the employment plan to indicate agreement between the job counselor
and the participant on the contents of the plan.
   (g) Participants who fail to meet the requirements in paragraph (a), without good cause under

section 256J.57, shall be sanctioned or permanently disqualified under subdivision 6. Good cause
may only be granted for that portion of the month for which the good cause reason applies.
Participants must meet all remaining requirements in the approved employment plan or be subject
to sanction or permanent disqualification.
    (h) If the noncompliance with an employment plan is due to the involuntary loss of employment,
the participant is exempt from the hourly employment requirement under this subdivision for one
month. Participants must meet all remaining requirements in the approved employment plan or be
subject to sanction or permanent disqualification. This exemption is available to each participant
two times in a 12-month period.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.46, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Participants not complying with program requirements. (a) A participant who
fails without good cause under section 256J.57 to comply with the requirements of this chapter, and
who is not subject to a sanction under subdivision 2, shall be subject to a sanction as provided in this
subdivision. Prior to the imposition of a sanction, a county agency shall provide a notice of intent
to sanction under section 256J.57, subdivision 2, and, when applicable, a notice of adverse action
as provided in section 256J.31.
    (b) A sanction under this subdivision becomes effective the month following the month in which
a required notice is given. A sanction must not be imposed when a participant comes into compliance
with the requirements for orientation under section 256J.45 prior to the effective date of the sanction.
A sanction must not be imposed when a participant comes into compliance with the requirements for
employment and training services under sections 256J.515 to 256J.57 ten days prior to the effective
date of the sanction. For purposes of this subdivision, each month that a participant fails to comply
with a requirement of this chapter shall be considered a separate occurrence of noncompliance.
If both participants in a two-parent assistance unit are out of compliance at the same time, it is
considered one occurrence of noncompliance.
   (c) Sanctions for noncompliance shall be imposed as follows:
    (1) For the first occurrence of noncompliance by a participant in an assistance unit, the assistance
unit's grant shall be reduced by ten percent of the MFIP standard of need for an assistance unit of
the same size with the residual grant paid to the participant. The reduction in the grant amount must
be in effect for a minimum of one month and shall be removed in the month following the month
that the participant returns to compliance.
    (2) For a second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth occurrence of noncompliance by a participant
in an assistance unit, the assistance unit's shelter costs shall be vendor paid up to the amount of
the cash portion of the MFIP grant for which the assistance unit is eligible. At county option, the
assistance unit's utilities may also be vendor paid up to the amount of the cash portion of the MFIP
grant remaining after vendor payment of the assistance unit's shelter costs. The residual amount
of the grant after vendor payment, if any, must be reduced by an amount equal to 30 percent of
the MFIP standard of need for an assistance unit of the same size before the residual grant is paid
to the assistance unit. The reduction in the grant amount must be in effect for a minimum of one
month and shall be removed in the month following the month that the participant in a one-parent
assistance unit returns to compliance. In a two-parent assistance unit, the grant reduction must be
in effect for a minimum of one month and shall be removed in the month following the month
both participants return to compliance. The vendor payment of shelter costs and, if applicable,

to compliance. If an assistance unit is sanctioned under this clause, the participant's case file must
be reviewed to determine if the employment plan is still appropriate.
    (d) For a seventh occurrence of noncompliance by a participant in an assistance unit, or when
the participants in a two-parent assistance unit have a total of seven occurrences of noncompliance,
the county agency shall close the MFIP assistance unit's financial assistance case, both the cash
and food portions, and redetermine the family's continued eligibility for food support payments.
The MFIP case must remain closed for a minimum of one full month. Before the case is closed,
the county agency or employment services provider must assess the participant and determine if
information is available that the participant may be eligible for family stabilization services based on
the criteria in section 256J.575, subdivision 3. The county agency must also review the participant's
case to determine if the employment plan is still appropriate and attempt to meet with the participant
face-to-face. The participant may bring an advocate to the face-to-face meeting. If a face-to-face
meeting is not conducted, the county agency must send the participant a written notice that includes
the information required under clause (1).
   (1) During the face-to-face meeting, the county agency must:
    (i) determine whether the continued noncompliance can be explained and mitigated by providing
a needed preemployment activity, as defined in section 256J.49, subdivision 13, clause (9);
    (ii) determine whether the participant qualifies for a good cause exception under section 256J.57,
or if the sanction is for noncooperation with child support requirements, determine if the participant
qualifies for a good cause exemption under section 256.741, subdivision 10;
    (iii) determine whether the work activities in the employment plan are appropriate based on the
criteria in section 256J.521, subdivision 2 or 3;
   (iv) determine whether the participant qualifies for the family violence waiver;
   (v) inform the participant of the participant's sanction status and explain the consequences of
continuing noncompliance;
   (vi) identify other resources that may be available to the participant to meet the needs of the
family; and
   (vii) inform the participant of the right to appeal under section 256J.40.
   (2) If the lack of an identified activity or service can explain the noncompliance, the county must
work with the participant to provide the identified activity.
    (3) The grant must be restored to the full amount for which the assistance unit is eligible
retroactively to the first day of the month in which the participant was found to lack preemployment
activities or to qualify for a family violence waiver, family stabilization services, or for a good
cause exemption under section 256.741, subdivision 10, or 256J.57.
    (e) For the purpose of applying sanctions under this section, only occurrences of noncompliance
that occur after July 1, 2003, shall be considered. If the participant is in 30 percent sanction in the
month this section takes effect, that month counts as the first occurrence for purposes of applying
the sanctions under this section, but the sanction shall remain at 30 percent for that month.

   (f) An assistance unit whose case is closed under paragraph (d) or (g), may reapply for MFIP
and shall be eligible if the participant complies with MFIP program requirements and demonstrates
compliance for up to one month. No assistance shall be paid during this period.
   (g) An assistance unit whose case has been closed for noncompliance, that reapplies under
paragraph (f), is subject to sanction under paragraph (c), clause (2), for a first occurrence of
noncompliance. Any subsequent occurrence of noncompliance shall result in case closure under
paragraph (d).

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.521, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Employment plan; contents. (a) Based on the assessment under subdivision 1, the
job counselor and the participant must develop an employment plan that includes participation in
activities and hours that meet the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1. The purpose of the
employment plan is to identify for each participant the most direct path to unsubsidized employment
and any subsequent steps that support long-term economic stability. The employment plan should
be developed using the highest level of activity appropriate for the participant. Activities must be
chosen from clauses (1) to (6), which are listed in order of preference. Notwithstanding this order
of preference for activities, priority must be given for activities related to a family violence waiver
when developing the employment plan. The employment plan must also list the specific steps the
participant will take to obtain employment, including steps necessary for the participant to progress
from one level of activity to another, and a timetable for completion of each step. Levels of activity
include:
   (1) unsubsidized employment;
   (2) job search;
   (3) subsidized employment or unpaid work experience;
   (4) unsubsidized employment and job readiness education or job skills training;
    (5) unsubsidized employment or unpaid work experience and activities related to a family
violence waiver or preemployment needs; and
   (6) activities related to a family violence waiver or preemployment needs.
    (b) Participants who are determined to possess sufficient skills such that the participant is likely
to succeed in obtaining unsubsidized employment must job search at least 30 hours per week for up
to six weeks and accept any offer of suitable employment. The remaining hours necessary to meet
the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1, may be met through participation in other work
activities under section 256J.49, subdivision 13. The participant's employment plan must specify, at
a minimum: (1) whether the job search is supervised or unsupervised; (2) support services that will
be provided; and (3) how frequently the participant must report to the job counselor. Participants
who are unable to find suitable employment after six weeks must meet with the job counselor to
determine whether other activities in paragraph (a) should be incorporated into the employment

    (d
     ­­) Participants who are determined to have barriers to obtaining or retaining employment that
will not be overcome during six weeks of job search under paragraph (b) must work with the job
counselor to develop an employment plan that addresses those barriers by incorporating appropriate
activities from paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6). The employment plan must include enough hours
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, unless a compelling reason
to require fewer hours is noted in the participant's file.

    g­) (f) When a participant fails to meet the agreed upon hours of participation in paid
employment because the participant is not eligible for holiday pay and the participant's place of
employment is closed for a holiday, the job counselor shall not impose a sanction or increase the
hours of participation in any other activity, including paid employment, to offset the hours that
were missed due to the holiday.

    (­
     h­) (g) Employment plans must be reviewed at least every three months to determine whether
activities and hourly requirements should be revised. The job counselor is encouraged to allow
participants who are participating in at least 20 hours of work activities to also participate in
education and training activities in order to meet the federal hourly participation rates.

employment services provider must inform the participant of the right to bring an advocate to the
face-to-face meeting.
   During the face-to-face meeting, the county agency shall:
   (1) determine whether the continued noncompliance can be explained and mitigated by
providing a needed family stabilization service, as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
    (2) determine whether the participant qualifies for a good cause exception under section 256J.57,
or if the sanction is for noncooperation with child support requirements, determine if the participant
qualifies for a good cause exemption under section 256.741, subdivision 10;
   (3) determine whether activities in the family stabilization plan are appropriate based on the
family's circumstances;
   (4) explain the consequences of continuing noncompliance;
   (5) identify other resources that may be available to the participant to meet the needs of the
family; and
   (6) inform the participant of the right to appeal under section 256J.40.
   If the lack of an identified activity or service can explain the noncompliance, the county shall
work with the participant to provide the identified activity.
   (d) If the participant fails to come to the face-to-face meeting, the case manager or a designee
shall attempt at least one home visit. If a face-to-face meeting is not conducted, the county agency
shall send the participant a written notice that includes the information under paragraph (c).
    (e) After the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) are met and prior to imposition of a sanction,
the county agency shall provide a notice of intent to sanction under section 256J.57, subdivision 2,
and, when applicable, a notice of adverse action under section 256J.31.
   (f) Section 256J.57 applies to this section except to the extent that it is modified by this
subdivision.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.621, is amended to read:

family's basic needs as the participant continues to move toward self-sufficiency.
    (b) To be eligible for work participation cash benefits, the participant shall not receive MFIP
or diversionary work program assistance during the month and the participant or participants must
meet the following work requirements:
   (1) if the participant is a single caregiver and has a child under six years of age, the participant

must be employed at least 87 hours per month;
    (2) if the participant is a single caregiver and does not have a child under six years of age, the
participant must be employed at least 130 hours per month; or
   (3) if the household is a two-parent family, at least one of the parents must be employed an

consecutive months.
    (c) Expenditures on the program are maintenance of effort state funds under a separate state
program for participants under paragraph (b), clauses (1) and (2). Expenditures for participants
under paragraph (b), clause (3), are nonmaintenance of effort funds. Months in which a participant
receives work participation cash benefits under this section do not count toward the participant's
MFIP 60-month time limit.

                                                ARTICLE 3
                       SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.10, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Application fee for initial license or certification. (a) For fees required under
subdivision 1, an applicant for an initial license or certification issued by the commissioner shall
submit a $500 application fee with each new application required under this subdivision. The
application fee shall not be prorated, is nonrefundable, and is in lieu of the annual license or
certification fee that expires on December 31. The commissioner shall not process an application
until the application fee is paid.
    (b) Except as provided in clauses (1) to (3), an applicant shall apply for a license to provide
services at a specific location.
    (1) For a license to provide waivered services to persons with developmental disabilities or
related conditions, an applicant shall submit an application for each county in which the waivered
services will be provided. Upon licensure, the license holder may provide services to persons in that
county plus no more than three persons at any one time in each of up to ten additional counties. A

license holder in one county may not provide services under the home and community-based waiver
for persons with developmental disabilities to more than three people in a second county without
holding a separate license for that second county. Applicants or licensees providing services under
this clause to not more than three persons, remain subject to the inspection fees established in section
245A.10, subdivision 2, for each location.
    (2) For a license to provide semi-independent living services to persons with developmental
disabilities or related conditions, an applicant shall submit a single application to provide services
statewide.
   (3) For a license to provide independent living assistance for youth under section 245A.22, an
applicant shall submit a single application to provide services statewide.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that staff are not present on-site overnight; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.
    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.
    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:
   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on-site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on-site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                       2869

    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2);
   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill be to conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
    (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on-site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on-site to respond to
the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the licenser holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to care, health,
and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license holder
to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation or
participation by the foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone
call or answer a telephone call does not meet this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under
item (i) during the absence of the license holder on-site;
    (iii) the license holder maintains written procedures to dispatch emergency response personnel
to the site in the event of an identified emergency; and
2870                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [41ST DAY

    (iv) each foster care recipient's individualized plan of care, individual service plan under section
256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required, or individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required, identifies the maximum response time, which may
be greater than ten minutes, for the license holder to be on-site for that foster care recipient.
    (f) All placement agreements, individual service agreements, and plans applicable to the foster
care recipient must clearly state that the adult foster care license category is a program without the
presence of a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours; the protocols in place for
responding to situations that present a serious risk to health, safety, or rights of foster care recipients
under paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2); and a signed informed consent from each foster care recipient
or the person's legal representative documenting the person's or legal representative's agreement with
placement in the program. If electronic monitoring technology is used in the home, the informed
consent form must also explain the following:
   (1) how any electronic monitoring is incorporated into the alternative supervision system;
   (2) the backup system for any electronic monitoring in times of electrical outages or other
equipment malfunctions;
   (3) how the license holder is trained on the use of the technology;
   (4) the event types and license holder response times established under paragraph (e);
    (5) how the license holder protects the foster care recipient's privacy related to electronic
monitoring and related to any electronically recorded data generated by the monitoring system. The
consent form must explain where and how the electronically recorded data is stored, with whom it
will be shared, and how long it is retained; and
   (6) the risks and benefits of the alternative overnight supervision system.
    The written explanations under clauses (1) to (6) may be accomplished through cross-references
to other policies and procedures as long as they are explained to the person giving consent, and the
person giving consent is offered a copy.
    (g) Nothing in this section requires the applicant or license holder to develop or maintain separate
or duplicative polices, procedures, documentation, consent forms, or individual plans that may be
required for other licensing standards, if the requirements of this section are incorporated into those
documents.
    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.
    (i) For the purposes of paragraphs (d) through (h), license holder has the meaning under section
245A.2, subdivision 9, and additionally includes all staff, volunteers, and contractors affiliated with
the license holder.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.16, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

with representatives from counties, advocacy organizations, and the provider community, shall
review the consolidated standards under chapter 245B and the supervised living facility rule under
Minnesota Rules, chapter 4665, to determine what provisions in Minnesota Rules, chapter 4665,
may be waived by the commissioner of health for intermediate care facilities in order to enable
facilities to implement the performance measures in their contract and provide quality services to
residents without a duplication of or increase in regulatory requirements.
  Sec. 13. COMMON SERVICE MENU FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED
WAIVER PROGRAMS.
    The commissioner of human services shall confer with representatives of recipients, advocacy
groups, counties, providers, and health plans to develop and update a common service menu
for home and community-based waiver programs. The commissioner may consult with existing
stakeholder groups convened under the commissioner's authority to meet all or part of the
requirements of this section.
  Sec. 14. INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES                                                                      FOR           PERSONS                 WITH
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES REPORT.

persons with developmental disabilities providers and advocates to monitor progress made in
response to the commissioner's December 15, 2008, report to the legislature regarding intermediate
care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities.

client is able to pay. If the client is unable to pay the uncovered cost of care, the commissioner
shall determine the client's relatives' ability to pay. The client and relatives shall provide to the
commissioner documents and proof necessary to determine the client and relatives' ability to
pay. Failure to provide the commissioner with sufficient information to determine ability to pay

client's relatives have the ability to pay. The client and relatives shall provide to the commissioner
documents and proof necessary to determine the client and relatives' ability to pay. Failure to provide
the commissioner with sufficient information to determine ability to pay may make the client or
relatives liable for the full cost of care until the time when sufficient information is provided. No
parent shall be liable for the cost of care given a client at a regional treatment center after the client
has reached the age of 18 years.

   (b) For services at the Minnesota extended treatment options program, a county's payment shall
be made from the county's own sources of revenue and payments shall equal a percentage of the
cost of care, as determined by the commissioner, for each day, or the portion thereof, that the client
spends at the program according to the following schedule:
      (1) ten percent for the first 90 days;
      (2) 20 percent for days 91 to 270; and
      (3) 50 percent for any days over 271.
If payments received by the state under sections 246.50 to 246.53 exceed 90 percent of the cost of
care for days zero to 90, 80 percent for days 91 to 270, or 50 percent for any days over 271, the
county shall be responsible for paying the state only the remaining amount. The county shall not be
entitled to reimbursement from the client, the client's estate, or from the client's relatives, except as
provided in section 246.53.
    (c) Regardless of the facility to which the client is committed, subdivision 1 does not apply to
the following individuals:
      (1) clients who are committed as mentally ill and dangerous under section 253B.02, subdivision
17;
   (2) clients who are committed as sexual psychopathic personalities under section 253B.02,
subdivision 18b; and

   (3) clients who are committed as sexually dangerous persons under section 253B.02, subdivision
18c.
   For each of the individuals in clauses (1) to (3), the payment by the county to the state shall
equal ten percent of the cost of care for each day as determined by the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 246B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1a. Client. "Client" means a person who is admitted to the Minnesota sex offender
program or subject to a court hold order under section 253B.185 for the purpose of assessment,
diagnosis, care, treatment, supervision, or other services provided by the Minnesota sex offender
program.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 246B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Client's county. "Client's county" means the county of the client's legal settlement for
poor relief purposes at the time of commitment. If the client has no legal settlement for poor relief
in this state, it means the county of commitment, except that when a client with no legal settlement
for poor relief is committed while serving a sentence at a penal institution, it means the county from
which the client was sentenced.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 246B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Cost of care. "Cost of care" means the commissioner's charge for housing and
treatment services provided to any person admitted to the Minnesota sex offender program.
    For purposes of this subdivision, "charge for housing and treatment services" means the cost of
services, treatment, maintenance, bonds issued for capital improvements, depreciation of buildings
and equipment, and indirect costs related to the operation of state facilities. The commissioner may
determine the charge for services on an anticipated average per diem basis as an all-inclusive charge
per facility.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 246B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Local social services agency. "Local social services agency" means the local social
services agency of the client's county as defined in subdivision 1b and of the county of commitment,
and any other local social services agency possessing information regarding, or requested by the
commissioner to investigate, the financial circumstances of a client.
   Sec. 13. [246B.07] PAYMENT FOR CARE AND TREATMENT: DETERMINATION.
    Subdivision 1. Procedures. The commissioner shall determine or redetermine, if necessary,
what amount of the cost of care, if any, the client is able to pay. The client shall provide to the
commissioner documents and proof necessary to determine the ability to pay. Failure to provide the
commissioner with sufficient information to determine ability to pay may make the client liable for
the full cost of care until the time when sufficient information is provided.
    Subd. 2. Rules. The commissioner shall use the standards in section 246.51, subdivision 2, to
determine the client's liability for the care provided by the Minnesota sex offender program.
41ST DAY]                           SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                         2879

   Subd. 3. Applicability. The commissioner may recover, under sections 246B.07 to 246B.10, the
cost of any care provided by the Minnesota sex offender program.
    Sec. 14. [246B.08] PAYMENT FOR CARE; ORDER; ACTION.
    The commissioner shall issue an order to the client or the guardian of the estate, if there is one,
requiring the client or guardian to pay to the state the amounts determined, the total of which must
not exceed the full cost of care. The order must specifically state the commissioner's determination
and must be conclusive, unless appealed. If a client fails to pay the amount due, the attorney general,
upon request of the commissioner, may institute, or direct the appropriate county attorney to institute
a civil action to recover the amount.
    Sec. 15. [246B.09] CLAIM AGAINST ESTATE OF DECEASED CLIENT.
    Subdivision 1. Client's estate. Upon the death of a client, or a former client, the total cost of care
provided to the client, less the amount actually paid toward the cost of care by the client, must be
filed by the commissioner as a claim against the estate of the client with the court having jurisdiction
to probate the estate, and all proceeds collected by the state in the case must be divided between the
state and county in proportion to the cost of care each has borne.
    Subd. 2. Preferred status. An estate claim in subdivision 1 must be considered an expense of
the last illness for purposes of section 524.3-805.
    If the commissioner determines that the property or estate of a client is not more than needed
to care for and maintain the spouse and minor or dependent children of a deceased client, the
commissioner has the power to compromise the claim of the state in a manner deemed just and
proper.
    Subd. 3. Exception from statute of limitations. Any statute of limitations that limits the
commissioner in recovering the cost of care obligation incurred by a client or former client must
not apply to any claim against an estate made under this section to recover cost of care.
    Sec. 16. [246B.10] LIABILITY OF COUNTY; REIMBURSEMENT.
    The client's county shall pay to the state a portion of the cost of care provided in the Minnesota
sex offender program to a client who has legally settled in that county. A county's payment must be
made from the county's own sources of revenue and payments must equal ten percent of the cost
of care, as determined by the commissioner, for each day or portion of a day, that the client spends

lead work outside of the person's property must obtain certification as a lead firm. The certificate
must be in writing, contain an expiration date, be signed by the commissioner, and give the name
and address of the person to whom it is issued. The certification fee is $100, is nonrefundable, and
must be submitted with each application. The certificate or a copy of the certificate must be readily
available at the worksite for review by the contracting entity, the commissioner, and other public
health officials charged with the health, safety, and welfare of the state's citizens.
     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9505, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Notice of regulated lead work. (a) At least five working days before starting work
at each regulated lead worksite, the person performing the regulated lead work shall give written
notice to the commissioner and the appropriate board of health.
    (b) This provision does not apply to lead hazard screen, lead inspection, lead risk assessment,
lead sampling technician, renovation, or lead project design activities.
     Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9508, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Regulated lead work standards and methods. (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules
establishing regulated lead work standards and methods in accordance with the provisions of this
section, for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, and soil in a manner that protects public health and
the environment for all residences, including residences also used for a commercial purpose, child
care facilities, playgrounds, and schools.
    (b) In the rules required by this section, the commissioner shall require lead hazard reduction
of intact paint only if the commissioner finds that the intact paint is on a chewable or lead-dust
producing surface that is a known source of actual lead exposure to a specific individual. The
commissioner shall prohibit methods that disperse lead dust into the air that could accumulate to
a level that would exceed the lead dust standard specified under this section. The commissioner
shall work cooperatively with the commissioner of administration to determine which lead
hazard reduction methods adopted under this section may be used for lead-safe practices
including prohibited practices, preparation, disposal, and cleanup. The commissioner shall
work cooperatively with the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency to develop disposal
procedures. In adopting rules under this section, the commissioner shall require the best available
technology for regulated lead work methods, paint stabilization, and repainting.

    (c) The commissioner of health shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead
in bare soil in a manner to protect public health and the environment. The commissioner shall adopt
a maximum standard of 100 parts of lead per million in bare soil. The commissioner shall set a soil
replacement standard not to exceed 25 parts of lead per million. Soil lead hazard reduction methods
shall focus on erosion control and covering of bare soil.
    (d) The commissioner shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead in dust
in a manner to protect the public health and environment. Dust standards shall use a weight of lead
per area measure and include dust on the floor, on the window sills, and on window wells. Lead
hazard reduction methods for dust shall focus on dust removal and other practices which minimize
the formation of lead dust from paint, soil, or other sources.
    (e) The commissioner shall adopt lead hazard reduction standards and methods for lead in
drinking water both at the tap and public water supply system or private well in a manner to protect
the public health and the environment. The commissioner may adopt the rules for controlling lead
in drinking water as contained in Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, part 141. Drinking water
lead hazard reduction methods may include an educational approach of minimizing lead exposure
from lead in drinking water.
    (f) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall adopt rules to ensure that removal
of exterior lead-based coatings from residences and steel structures by abrasive blasting methods is
conducted in a manner that protects health and the environment.
   (g) All regulated lead work standards shall provide reasonable margins of safety that
are consistent with more than a summary review of scientific evidence and an emphasis on
overprotection rather than underprotection when the scientific evidence is ambiguous.
   (h) No unit of local government shall have an ordinance or regulation governing regulated lead
work standards or methods for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, or soil that require a different
regulated lead work standard or method than the standards or methods established under this section.
   (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (h), the commissioner may approve the use by a unit of local
government of an innovative lead hazard reduction method which is consistent in approach with
methods established under this section.
    (j) The commissioner shall adopt rules for issuing lead orders required under section 144.9504,
rules for notification of abatement or interim control activities requirements, and other rules
necessary to implement sections 144.9501 to 144.9512.
   (k) The commissioners shall adopt rules consistent with section 402(c)(3) of the Toxic
Substances Control Act to ensure that renovation is a pre-1978 affected property where a child or
pregnant female resides is conducted in a manner that protects health and the environment.
   (l) The commissioner shall adopt rules consistent with sections 406(a) and 406(b) of the Toxic
Substances Control Act.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9508, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Available programs, categories, and analytes. (a) The commissioner shall accredit
laboratories that test samples under the following programs:
   (1) the clean water program, such as compliance monitoring under the federal Clean Water Act,
and ambient monitoring of surface and ground water, or analysis of biological tissue;
   (2) the safe drinking water program, including compliance monitoring under the federal Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the state requirements for monitoring private wells;
   (3) the resource conservation and recovery program, including federal and state requirements for
monitoring solid and hazardous wastes, biological tissue, leachates, and ground water monitoring
wells not intended as drinking water sources;
    (4) the underground storage tank program; and
   (5) the clean air program, including air and emissions testing under the federal Clean Air Act,
and state and federal requirements for vapor intrusion monitoring.
   (b) The commissioner shall maintain and publish a list of analytes available for accreditation.
The list must be reviewed at least once every six months and the changes published in the State
Register and posted on the program's Web site. The commissioner shall publish the notification of
changes and review comments on the changes no less than 30 days from the date the list is published.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3b. Additional fees. (a) Laboratories located outside of this state that require an on-site
assessment more frequent than once every two years must pay an additional assessed fee of $3,000
per assessment for each additional on-site assessment conducted. The laboratory must pay the fee
within 15 business days of receiving the commissioner's notification that an on-site assessment is
required. The commissioner may conduct additional on-site assessments to determine a laboratory's
continued compliance with the standards provided in subdivision 2a.
   (b) A late fee of $200 shall be added to the annual fee for accredited laboratories submitting
renewal applications to the commissioner after November 1.
    (c) A change fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests additional fields of testing at any
time other than when initially applying for or renewing its accreditation. A change fee does not
apply for applications to add fields of testing for new analytes in response to the published notice
under subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), if the laboratory holds valid accreditation for the changed test
category and applies for additional analytes within the same test category. The change fee is equal
to the applicable test category fee for the field of testing requested. An application that requests
accreditation of multiple fields of testing within a test category requires a single payment of the
applicable test category fee per application submitted.

    (d) A variance fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests a variance from a standard provided
in subdivision 2a. The variance fee is $500 per variance.
   (e) The commissioner shall assess a fee for changes to laboratory information regarding
ownership, name, address, or personnel. Laboratories must submit changes through the application
process under subdivision 6. The information update fee is $250 per application.
   (f) Fees must be set so that the total fees support the laboratory accreditation program. Direct
costs of the accreditation service include program administration, assessments, the agency's general
support costs, and attorney general costs attributable to the fee function.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3c. Refunds and nonpayment. Refunds or credits shall not be made for applications
received but not approved. Accreditation of a laboratory shall not be awarded until all fees are paid.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Application. (a) Laboratories seeking accreditation must apply on a form provided by
the commissioner, include the laboratory's procedures and quality manual, and pay the applicable
fees.
   (b) Laboratories may be fixed-base or mobile. The commissioner shall accredit mobile
laboratories individually and require a vehicle identification number, license plate number, or other
uniquely identifying information in addition to the application requirements of paragraph (a).
   (c) Laboratories maintained on separate properties, even though operated under the same
management or ownership, must apply separately. Laboratories with more than one building on the
same or adjoining properties do not need to submit a separate application.
    (d) The commissioner may accredit laboratories located out-of-state. Accreditation for
out-of-state laboratories may be obtained directly from the commissioner following the
requirements in paragraph (a), or out-of-state laboratories may be accredited through a reciprocal
agreement if the laboratory:
    (1) is accredited by a NELAP-recognized accreditation body for those fields of testing in which
the laboratory requests accreditation from the commissioner;
   (2) submits an application and documentation according to this subdivision; and
   (3) submits a current copy of the laboratory's unexpired accreditation from a NELAP-recognized
accreditation body showing the fields of accreditation for which the laboratory is currently
accredited.
    (e) Under the conflict of interest determinations provided in section 43A.38, subdivision 6,
clause (a), the commissioner shall not accredit governmental laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state. If accreditation is required, laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state must apply for accreditation through any other NELAP-recognized
accreditation body.

required in this section, provided the laboratory maintains compliance with the standards specified
in subdivision 2a, and attests to the compliance on the application form.
   (b) The commissioner shall prorate the fees in subdivision 3 for laboratories applying for
accreditation after December 31. The fees are prorated on a quarterly basis beginning with the
quarter in which the commissioner receives the completed application from the laboratory.
   (c) Applications for renewal of accreditation must be received by November 1 and no earlier
than October 1 of each year. The commissioner shall send annual renewal notices to laboratories
90 days before expiration. Failure to receive a renewal notice does not exempt laboratories from
meeting the annual November 1 renewal date.
    (d) The commissioner shall issue all accreditations for the calendar year for which the application
is made, and the accreditation shall expire on December 31 of that year.
    (e) The accreditation of any laboratory that fails to submit a renewal application and fees to
the commissioner expires automatically on December 31 without notice or further proceeding.
Any person who operates a laboratory as accredited after expiration of accreditation or without
having submitted an application and paid the fees is in violation of the provisions of this section
and is subject to enforcement action under sections 144.989 to 144.993, the Health Enforcement
Consolidation Act. A laboratory with expired accreditation may reapply under subdivision 6.

    Prior to final promulgation of the joint rule the commissioner of human services shall report
preliminary findings along with any comments of the advisory group and a plan for monitoring and
enforcement by the Department of Health to the legislature by February 15, 1992.
   Limits on the extent of personal care services that may be provided to an individual must be
based on the cost-effectiveness of the services in relation to the costs of inpatient hospital care,
nursing home care, and other available types of care. The rules must provide, at a minimum:
    (1) that agencies be selected to contract with or employ and train staff to provide and supervise
the provision of personal care services;
    (2) that agencies employ or contract with a qualified applicant that a qualified recipient proposes
to the agency as the recipient's choice of assistant;

in that county and shall waive the requirement for personal care assistants required to join an agency
for the first time during 1993 when personal care services are provided under a relative hardship
waiver under Minnesota Statutes 1992, section 256B.0627, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (7),
and at least two agencies providing personal care services have refused to employ or contract with
the independent personal care assistant.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.055, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Disabled children. (a) A person is eligible for medical assistance if the person is under
age 19 and qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section 1382c(a), and
would be eligible for medical assistance under the state plan if residing in a medical institution, and
the child requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities, for whom home care is appropriate, provided that the
cost to medical assistance under this section is not more than the amount that medical assistance
would pay for if the child resides in an institution. After the child is determined to be eligible under
this section, the commissioner shall review the child's disability under United States Code, title
42, section 1382c(a) and level of care defined under this section no more often than annually and
may elect, based on the recommendation of health care professionals under contract with the state
medical review team, to extend the review of disability and level of care up to a maximum of four
years. The commissioner's decision on the frequency of continuing review of disability and level of
care is not subject to administrative appeal under section 256.045. The county agency shall send a
notice of disability review to the enrollee six months prior to the date the recertification of disability
is due. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting other redeterminations of medical

assistance eligibility under this chapter and annual cost-effective reviews under this section.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means an institution as defined in section
144.696, subdivision 3, 144.55, subdivision 3, or Minnesota Rules, part 4640.3600, and licensed
pursuant to sections 144.50 to 144.58. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of
care provided in a hospital if the child is determined by the commissioner to need an extensive
array of health services, including mental health services, for an undetermined period of time,
whose health condition requires frequent monitoring and treatment by a health care professional
or by a person supervised by a health care professional, who would reside in a hospital or require
frequent hospitalization if these services were not provided, and the daily care needs are more
complex than a nursing facility level of care.
    A child with serious emotional disturbance requires a level of care provided in a hospital if
the commissioner determines that the individual requires 24-hour supervision because the person
exhibits recurrent or frequent suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, recurrent or frequent
psychosomatic disorders or somatopsychic disorders that may become life threatening, recurrent or
frequent severe socially unacceptable behavior associated with psychiatric disorder, ongoing and
chronic psychosis or severe, ongoing and chronic developmental problems requiring continuous
skilled observation, or severe disabling symptoms for which office-centered outpatient treatment is
not adequate, and which overall severely impact the individual's ability to function.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "nursing facility" means a facility which provides nursing
care as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, licensed pursuant to sections 144A.02 to 144A.10,
which is appropriate if a person is in active restorative treatment; is in need of special treatments
provided or supervised by a licensed nurse; or has unpredictable episodes of active disease processes
requiring immediate judgment by a licensed nurse. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires
the level of care provided in a nursing facility if the child is determined by the commissioner to meet
the requirements of the preadmission screening assessment document under section 256B.0911 and
the home care independent rating document under section ­          25

    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities" or "ICF/MR" means a program licensed to provide services to persons with
developmental disabilities under section 252.28, and chapter 245A, and a physical plant licensed
as a supervised living facility under chapter 144, which together are certified by the Minnesota
Department of Health as meeting the standards in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part
483, for an intermediate care facility which provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities who require 24-hour supervision and active treatment for medical, behavioral, or
habilitation needs. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of care provided in an
ICF/MR if the commissioner finds that the child has a developmental disability in accordance with
section 256B.092, is in need of a 24-hour plan of care and active treatment similar to persons with
developmental disabilities, and there is a reasonable indication that the child will need ICF/MR
services.
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a person requires the level of care provided in a nursing
facility if the person requires 24-hour monitoring or supervision and a plan of mental health
treatment because of specific symptoms or functional impairments associated with a serious mental
illness or disorder diagnosis, which meet severity criteria for mental health established by the

commissioner and published in March 1997 as the Minnesota Mental Health Level of Care for
Children and Adolescents with Severe Emotional Disorders.
    (f) The determination of the level of care needed by the child shall be made by the commissioner
based on information supplied to the commissioner by the parent or guardian, the child's physician
or physicians, and other professionals as requested by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
establish a screening team to conduct the level of care determinations according to this subdivision.
    (g) If a child meets the conditions in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e), the commissioner must assess
the case to determine whether:
   (1) the child qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section
1382c(a), and would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a medical institution; and
    (2) the cost of medical assistance services for the child, if eligible under this subdivision, would
not be more than the cost to medical assistance if the child resides in a medical institution to be
determined as follows:
    (i) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the cost of care for the child
in an institution shall be determined using the average payment rate established for the regional
treatment centers that are certified as ICF's/MR;
    (ii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an inpatient hospital setting according to
paragraph (b), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3520,
items F and G; and
    (iii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in a nursing facility according to paragraph
(c) or (e), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3040,
except that the nursing facility average rate shall be adjusted to reflect rates which would be paid
for children under age 16. The commissioner may authorize an amount up to the amount medical
assistance would pay for a child referred to the commissioner by the preadmission screening team
under section 256B.0911.
    (h) Children eligible for medical assistance services under section 256B.055, subdivision 12, as
of June 30, 1995, must be screened according to the criteria in this subdivision prior to January 1,
1996. Children found to be ineligible may not be removed from the program until January 1, 1996.

   (5) "targeted case management" means case management services provided to help recipients
gain access to needed medical, social, educational, and other services and supports.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 19a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 19a. Personal care assistant services. Medical assistance covers personal care
assistant services in a recipient's home. To qualify for personal care assistant services, recipients
or responsible parties must be able to identify the recipient's needs, direct and evaluate task
accomplishment, and provide for health and safety. Approved hours may be used outside the home
when normal life activities take them outside the home. To use personal care assistant services
at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan
identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school. Total hours
for services, whether actually performed inside or outside the recipient's home, cannot exceed that
which is otherwise allowed for personal care assistant services in an in-home setting according to
sections 256B.0651 ­       an

cover personal care assistant services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care
facility, health care facility licensed by the commissioner of health, or unless a resident who is
otherwise eligible is on leave from the facility and the facility either pays for the personal care
assistant services or forgoes the facility per diem for the leave days that personal care assistant
services are used. All personal care assistant services must be provided according to sections
256B.0651 ­     an

be reimbursed if the personal care assistant is the spouse or legal guardian of the recipient or the
parent of a recipient under age 18, or the responsible party or the foster care provider of a recipient
who cannot direct the recipient's own care unless, in the case of a foster care provider, a county or
state case manager visits the recipient as needed, but not less than every six months, to monitor
the health and safety of the recipient and to ensure the goals of the care plan are met. Parents of
adult recipients, adult children of the recipient or adult siblings of the recipient may be reimbursed
for personal care assistant services, if they are granted a waiver under sections 256B.0651 ­               an­d

methods for allocating to local agencies the home and community-based waivered service resources
available to support recipients with disabilities in need of the level of care provided in a nursing
facility or a hospital. The commissioner shall allocate resources to single counties and county
partnerships in a manner that reflects consideration of:
   (1) an incentive-based payment process for achieving outcomes;
   (2) the need for a state-level risk pool;
   (3) the need for retention of management responsibility at the state agency level; and
   (4) a phase-in strategy as appropriate.
    (c) Until the allocation methods described in paragraph (b) are implemented, the annual
allowable reimbursement level of home and community-based waiver services shall be the greater
of:
    (1) the statewide average payment amount which the recipient is assigned under the waiver
reimbursement system in place on June 30, 2001, modified by the percentage of any provider rate
increase appropriated for home and community-based services; or
    (2) an amount approved by the commissioner based on the recipient's extraordinary needs that
cannot be met within the current allowable reimbursement level. The increased reimbursement level
must be necessary to allow the recipient to be discharged from an institution or to prevent imminent
placement in an institution. The additional reimbursement may be used to secure environmental
modifications; assistive technology and equipment; and increased costs for supervision, training,
and support services necessary to address the recipient's extraordinary needs. The commissioner
may approve an increased reimbursement level for up to one year of the recipient's relocation from
an institution or up to six months of a determination that a current waiver recipient is at imminent
risk of being placed in an institution.

limits of the established average daily reimbursement rates for waivered services to include the
cost of home care services that may be provided to waivered services recipients. This adjustment
must be used to maintain or increase services and shall not be used by county agencies for inflation
increases for waivered services vendors. Home care services referenced in this section are those
listed in section 256B.0651, subdivision 2. The average daily reimbursement rates established in
accordance with the provisions of this subdivision apply only to the combined average, daily costs of
waivered and home care services and do not change home care limitations under sections 256B.0651

    Sec. 3. STATE-COUNTY CHEMICAL HEALTH CARE HOME PILOT PROJECT.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; purpose. There is established a state-county chemical health
care home pilot project. The purpose of the pilot project is for the Department of Human Services and
counties to authentically and creatively work in partnership to redesign the current chemical health
service delivery system in a way that promotes greater accountability, productivity, and results in the
delivery of state chemical dependency services. The pilot project or projects must look to provide
appropriate flexibility in a way that ensures timely access to needed services as well as better aligning
systems and services to offer the most appropriate level of chemical health care services to the
client. This may include, but is not limited to, looking into new governance agreements, performance
agreements, or service level agreements. Pilot projects must maintain eligibility requirements for the
consolidated chemical dependency treatment fund, continue to meet the requirements of Minnesota
Rules, parts 9530.6600 to 9530.6655 (also known as Rule 25) and Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6405
to 9530.6505 (also known as Rule 31), and must not put at risk current and future federal funding
toward chemical health-related services in the state of Minnesota.
   Subd. 2. Workgroup; report. A workgroup must be convened on or before July 15, 2009,
consisting of representatives from the Department of Human Services and potential participating
counties to develop draft proposals for pilot projects meeting the requirements of this section. The
workgroup shall report back to the legislative committees with jurisdiction over chemical health by
January 15, 2010, for potential approval of one metro and one nonmetro county pilot project to be
implemented beginning July 10, 2010.
    Subd. 3. Report. The Department of Human Services shall evaluate the efficacy and feasibility
of the pilot projects and report the results of that evaluation to the legislative committees having
jurisdiction over chemical health by June 30, 2011. Expansion of pilot projects may occur only if
the department's report finds the pilot projects effective.
    Subd. 4. Expiration. This section expires June 30, 2012.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

practice, shall pay an initial fee or a biennial license renewal fee if the person wishes to practice
veterinary medicine in the coming two-year period or remain licensed as a veterinarian. A licensure
period begins on March 1 and expires the last day of February two years later. A licensee with an
even-numbered license shall renew by March 1 of even-numbered years and a licensee with an
odd-numbered license shall renew by March 1 of odd-numbered years.
    Subd. 2. Amount. The initial licensure fee and the biennial renewal fee is $280 and must be paid
to the executive director of the board. By January 1 of the first year for which the biennial renewal fee
is due, the board shall issue a renewal application to a current licensee to the last address maintained
in the board file. Failure to receive this notice does not relieve the licensee of the obligation to pay
renewal fees so that they are received by the board on or before the renewal date of March 1.
    Initial licenses issued after the start of the licensure renewal period are valid only until the end
of the period.
    Subd. 3. Date due. A licensee must apply for a renewal license on or before March 1 of the first
year of the biennial license renewal period. A renewal license is valid from March 1 through the last
day of February of the last year of the two-year license renewal period. An application postmarked
no later than the last day of February must be considered to have been received on March 1.
    Subd. 4. Late renewal penalty. An applicant for renewal must pay a late renewal penalty of
$140 in addition to the renewal fee if the application for renewal is received after March 1 of the
licensure renewal period. A renewed license issued after March 1 of the licensure renewal period is
valid only to the end of the period regardless of when the renewal fee is received.
     Subd. 5. Reinstatement fee. An applicant for license renewal whose license has previously been

suspended by official board action for nonrenewal must pay a reinstatement fee of $60 in addition
to the $280 renewal fee and the $140 late renewal penalty.
    Subd. 6. Penalty for failure to pay. Within 30 days after the renewal date, a licensee who has
not renewed the license must be notified by letter sent to the last known address of the licensee in
the file of the board that the renewal is overdue and that failure to pay the current fee and current late
fee within 60 days after the renewal date will result in suspension of the license. A second notice
must be sent by registered or certified mail at least seven days before a board meeting occurring 60
days or more after the renewal date to a licensee who has not paid the renewal fee and late fee.
    Subd. 7. Suspension. The board, by means of a roll call vote, shall suspend the license of a
licensee whose license renewal is at least 60 days overdue and to whom notification has been sent
as provided in subpart 5. Failure of a licensee to receive notification is not grounds for later challenge
by the licensee of the suspension. The former licensee must be notified by registered or certified letter
within seven days of the board action. The suspended status placed on a license may be removed
only on payment of renewal fees and late penalty fees for each licensure period or part of a period
that the license was not renewed. A licensee who fails to renew a license for five years or more must
meet the criteria of section 156.071, for relicensure.
    Subd. 8. Inactive license. (a) A person holding a current active license to practice veterinary
medicine in Minnesota may, at the time of the person's next biennial license renewal date, renew
the license as an inactive license at one-half the renewal fee of an active license. The license may
be continued in an inactive status by renewal on a biennial basis at one-half the regular license fee.
   (b) A person holding an inactive license is not permitted to practice veterinary medicine in
Minnesota and remains under the disciplinary authority of the board.
   (c) A person may convert a current inactive license to an active license upon application to and
approval by the board. The application must include:
   (1) documentation of licensure in good standing and of having met continuing education
requirements of current state of practice, or documentation of having met Minnesota continuing
education requirements retroactive to the date of licensure inactivation;
   (2) certification by the applicant that the applicant is not currently under disciplinary orders or
investigation for acts that could result in disciplinary action in any other jurisdiction; and
    (3) payment of a fee equal to the full difference between an inactive and active license if
converting during the first year of the biennial license cycle or payment of a fee equal to one-half
the difference between an inactive and an active license if converting during the second year of
the license cycle.
    (d) Deadline for renewal of an inactive license is March 1 of the first year of the biennial license
renewal period. A late renewal penalty of one-half the inactive renewal fee must be paid if renewal
is received after March 1.

    Subd. 3. Implementation. Consistent with section 256B.0625, subdivision 26, school districts
may enroll as medical assistance providers or subcontractors and bill the Department of Human
Services under the medical assistance fee for service claims processing system for special education
services which are covered services under chapter 256B, which are provided in the school setting
for a medical assistance recipient, and for whom the district has secured informed consent consistent
with section 13.05, subdivision 4, paragraph (d), and section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),
to bill for each type of covered service. School districts shall be reimbursed by the commissioner of
human services for the federal share of individual education plan health-related services that qualify
for reimbursement by medical assistance, minus up to five percent retained by the commissioner of
human services for administrative costs,  ­

may withhold up to five percent of each payment to a school district. Following the end of each fiscal
year, the commissioner shall settle up with each school district in order to ensure that collections
from each district for departmental administrative costs are made on a pro rata basis according
to federal earnings for these services in each district. A school district is not eligible to enroll as
a home care provider or a personal care provider organization for purposes of billing home care
services under sections 256B.0651 and 256B.0653 to 256B.0656 until the commissioner of human
services issues a bulletin instructing county public health nurses on how to assess for the needs
of eligible recipients during school hours. To use private duty nursing services or personal care
services at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care
plan identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school.

                                            ) The commissioner shall develop and implement a
pay-for-performance system to provide performance payments to eligible medical groups and
clinics that demonstrate optimum care in serving individuals with chronic diseases who are enrolled
in health care programs administered by the commissioner under chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L.
The commissioner may receive any federal matching money that is made available through the
medical assistance program for managed care oversight contracted through vendors, including
consumer surveys, studies, and external quality reviews as required by the federal Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part 438-managed care, subpart E-external
quality review. Any federal money received for managed care oversight is appropriated to the
commissioner for this purpose. The commissioner may expend the federal money received in either
year of the biennium.

    Subdivision 1. Urgent dental care services. The commissioner shall authorize a pilot project to
reduce the total cost to the state for dental services provided to enrollees of the state public health
care programs by reducing hospital emergency room costs for preventable or nonemergency dental
services. As part of the project, a community dental clinic or dental provider, in collaboration with a
hospital emergency room, shall provide urgent care dental services as an alternative to the hospital
emergency room for nonemergency dental care. The project participants shall establish a process
to divert a patient presenting at the emergency room for nonemergency dental care to the dental
community clinic or to an appropriate dental provider. The commissioner may establish special
payment rates for urgent care services provided and may change or waive existing payment policies
in order to adequately reimburse providers for providing cost-effective alternative services in an
outpatient or urgent care setting. The commissioner may establish a project in conjunction with the
initiative authorized under section 256.963.
    Subd. 2. Dental care in nursing facilities. (a) The commissioner shall establish a pilot project
to improve access to on-site dental services for residents of nursing facilities. The pilot project
must demonstrate methods of reducing total costs to the state by providing more cost-effective
delivery of dental services, including new workforce roles, enhanced caregiver assistance with daily
oral care, periodic assessment and triage of dental problems, care coordination and provision of
comprehensive year round on-site dental services. As part of the pilot project, the commissioner
may:
    (1) establish a special pilot project funding model for dental services provided that waives
existing reimbursement policies; and
   (2) contract with a single on-site dental provider to provide services to residents of pilot project
nursing facilities.
   (b) The commissioner shall evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot project on cost-savings and

health outcomes.
    Subd. 3. Dental health care homes. The commissioner shall establish a pilot project under
which dental providers shall be paid a care coordination fee to coordinate dental care for patients
with existing dental disease and for whom the total cost of dental care for the patients can be reduced
through better prevention, coordination of services, use of cost-effective treatments and settings,
and reducing utilization of hospital emergency rooms and reductions in hospitalizations for medical
problems linked with oral infections.
   Sec. 11. [256.9652] E-PRESCRIBING INITIATIVE.
   (a) The commissioner shall implement a demonstration project that incorporates e-prescribing
applications with a clinical information database in order to increase patient safety and efficiencies
and reduce medication errors, duplication of therapies, and eliminate waste.
    (b) The commissioner shall identify providers who are currently using e-prescribing and ensure
that each provider has the ability through e-prescribing software to receive the following:
   (1) a patient's specific medication history for the last 100 days;
   (2) the preferred drug list and formulary verification;
   (3) prescription details; and
   (4) drug interaction alerts.
    (c) Beginning January 1, 2010, each provider identified by the commissioner shall use the
e-prescribing applications for each prescription.
    (d) Beginning January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall ensure that any provider using
e-prescribing has access to the applications identified in paragraph (b).
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Operating payment rates. In determining operating payment rates for admissions
occurring on or after the rate year beginning January 1, 1991, and every two years after, or more
frequently as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain operating data from
an updated base year and establish operating payment rates per admission for each hospital based on
the cost-finding methods and allowable costs of the Medicare program in effect during the base year.
Rates under the general assistance medical care, medical assistance, and MinnesotaCare programs
shall not be rebased to more current data on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2005, ­     an
                                                                                      ­d­ for the first 24
months of the rebased period beginning January 1, 2009, and for the first three months of the rebased
period beginning January 1, 2011. From April 1, 2011, to March 31, 2012, rates shall be rebased
at 72.5 percent of full value. Effective April 1, 2012, rates shall be rebased at full value. The base
year operating payment rate per admission is standardized by the case mix index and adjusted by
the hospital cost index, relative values, and disproportionate population adjustment. The cost and
charge data used to establish operating rates shall only reflect inpatient services covered by medical
assistance and shall not include property cost information and costs recognized in outlier payments.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                        2953

must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.
    (d) In addition to the reduction in paragraphs (b) and (c), the total payment for fee-for-service
admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2005, made to hospitals for inpatient services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 6.0 percent from the current statutory rates. Mental
health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision
16 are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for
purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care.
Payments made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January
1, 2006, to reflect this reduction.

    (e) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 3.46 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432
and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to
managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2009, through
June 30, 2009, to reflect this reduction.
    (f) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 1.9 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432
and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to
managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after July 1, 2009, through June
30, 2010, to reflect this reduction.

fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2010, made to hospitals for inpatient
services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 1.79 percent from the current
statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities
defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to managed care
plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after July 1, 2010, to reflect this reduction.
    (h) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g), the total payment
for fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2009, made to hospitals for inpatient
services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced one percent from the current
statutory rates. Facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after October 1, 2009, to
reflect this reduction.

and quality measure used for provider peer grouping, and separate thresholds shall be set for hospital
and physician services.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2012, any health care provider with a combined cost and quality score
below the threshold set in paragraph (a) shall be prohibited from enrolling as a vendor of medical
care in the medical assistance, general assistance medical care, or MinnesotaCare programs, and
shall not be eligible for direct payments under those programs or for payments made by managed
care plans under their contracts with the commissioner under section 256B.69 or 256L.12. A
health care provider that is prohibited from enrolling as a vendor or receiving payments under this

than $6,000 in assets, plus $200 for each additional legal dependent. In addition to these maximum
amounts, an eligible individual or family may accrue interest on these amounts, but they must be
reduced to the maximum at the time of an eligibility redetermination. The accumulation of the
clothing and personal needs allowance according to section 256B.35 must also be reduced to the
maximum at the time of the eligibility redetermination. The value of assets that are not considered

of a trade or business;
   (3) motor vehicles are excluded to the same extent excluded by the supplemental security income
program;
    (4) assets designated as burial expenses are excluded to the same extent excluded by the
supplemental security income program. Burial expenses funded by annuity contracts or life
insurance policies must irrevocably designate the individual's estate as contingent beneficiary to
the extent proceeds are not used for payment of selected burial expenses; and

of ineligibility as an employed person with a disability, to the extent that the person's total assets
remain within the allowed limits of section 256B.057, subdivision 9, paragraph (c).
The assets specified in clauses (1) to (4) must be disclosed to the local agency at the time of
application and at the time of an eligibility redetermination, and must be verified upon request of
the local agency.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.056, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Treatment of trusts. (a) A "medical assistance qualifying trust" is a revocable or
irrevocable trust, or similar legal device, established on or before August 10, 1993, by a person
or the person's spouse under the terms of which the person receives or could receive payments
from the trust principal or income and the trustee has discretion in making payments to the person
from the trust principal or income. Notwithstanding that definition, a medical assistance qualifying
trust does not include: (1) a trust set up by will; (2) a trust set up before April 7, 1986, solely to
benefit a person with a developmental disability living in an intermediate care facility for persons
with developmental disabilities; or (3) a trust set up by a person with payments made by the Social
Security Administration pursuant to the United States Supreme Court decision in Sullivan v. Zebley,
110 S. Ct. 885 (1990). The maximum amount of payments that a trustee of a medical assistance
qualifying trust may make to a person under the terms of the trust is considered to be available
assets to the person, without regard to whether the trustee actually makes the maximum payments

treated according to section 13611(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),
Public Law 103-66.
   (c) For purposes of paragraph (d), a pooled trust means a trust established under United States
Code, title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(C).
    (d) A beneficiary's interest in a pooled trust is considered an available asset unless the trust
provides that upon the death of the beneficiary or termination of the trust during the beneficiary's
lifetime, whichever is sooner, the department receives any amount up to the amount of medical
assistance benefits paid on behalf of the beneficiary remaining in the beneficiary's trust account after
a deduction for reasonable administrative fees and expenses and an additional remainder amount.
The retained remainder amount of the subaccount must not exceed ten percent of the account value
at the time of the beneficiary's death or termination of the trust and must only be used for the benefit
of disabled individuals who have a beneficiary interest in the pooled trust.

must not own more than $20,000 in total net assets, and a household of one person must not own
more than $10,000 in total net assets. In addition to these maximum amounts, an eligible individual
or family may accrue interest on these amounts, but they must be reduced to the maximum at the time
of an eligibility redetermination. The value of assets that are not considered in determining eligibility
for medical assistance for families and children is the value of those assets excluded under the AFDC
state plan as of July 16, 1996, as required by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), Public Law 104-193, with the following exceptions:

that a bank account that contains personal income or assets, or is used to pay personal expenses, is
not considered a capital or operating asset of a trade or business;
   (3) one motor vehicle is excluded for each person of legal driving age who is employed or
seeking employment;
   (4) one burial plot and all other burial expenses equal to the supplemental security income
program asset limit are not considered for each individual;

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.057, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
  Subd. 9. Employed persons with disabilities. (a) Medical assistance may be paid for a person
who is employed and who:
    (1) meets the definition of disabled under the supplemental security income program;
    (2) is at least 16 but less than 65 years of age;
    (3) meets the asset limits in paragraph (c); and
    (4) effective November 1, 2003, pays a premium and other obligations under paragraph (e).
Any spousal income or assets shall be disregarded for purposes of eligibility and premium
determinations.

who:
   (1) is temporarily unable to work and without receipt of earned income due to a medical
condition, as verified by a physician, may retain eligibility for up to four calendar months; or
    (2) effective January 1, 2004, loses employment for reasons not attributable to the enrollee,
may retain eligibility for up to four consecutive months after the month of job loss. To receive
a four-month extension, enrollees must verify the medical condition or provide notification of job
loss. All other eligibility requirements must be met and the enrollee must pay all calculated premium
costs for continued eligibility.
   (c) For purposes of determining eligibility under this subdivision, a person's assets must not
exceed $20,000, excluding:
   (1) all assets excluded under section 256B.056;
   (2) retirement accounts, including individual accounts, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, Keogh plans,
and pension plans; and
   (3) medical expense accounts set up through the person's employer.
    (d)(1) Effective January 1, 2004, for purposes of eligibility, there will be a $65 earned income
disregard. To be eligible, a person applying for medical assistance under this subdivision must have
earned income above the disregard level.
   (2) Effective January 1, 2004, to be considered earned income, Medicare, Social Security, and
applicable state and federal income taxes must be withheld. To be eligible, a person must document
earned income tax withholding.
    (e)(1) A person whose earned and unearned income is equal to or greater than 100 percent
of federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size must pay a premium to be eligible
for medical assistance under this subdivision. The premium shall be based on the person's gross
earned and unearned income and the applicable family size using a sliding fee scale established
by the commissioner, which begins at one percent of income at 100 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines and increases to 7.5 percent of income for those with incomes at or above 300 percent of
the federal poverty guidelines. Annual adjustments in the premium schedule based upon changes in
the federal poverty guidelines shall be effective for premiums due in July of each year.
    (2) Effective January 1, 2004, all enrollees must pay a premium to be eligible for medical
assistance under this subdivision. An enrollee shall pay the greater of a $35 premium or the
premium calculated in clause (1).
    (3) Effective November 1, 2003, all enrollees who receive unearned income must pay one-half
of one percent of unearned income in addition to the premium amount.
    (4) Effective November 1, 2003, for enrollees whose income does not exceed 200 percent of the
federal poverty guidelines and who are also enrolled in Medicare, the commissioner must reimburse
the enrollee for Medicare Part B premiums under section 256B.0625, subdivision 15, paragraph (a).
    (5) Increases in benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall not be counted as income
for purposes of this subdivision until July 1 of each year.

must be paid to the commissioner. All premiums are dedicated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any required premium shall be determined at application and redetermined at the enrollee's
six-month income review or when a change in income or household size is reported. Enrollees
must report any change in income or household size within ten days of when the change occurs. A
decreased premium resulting from a reported change in income or household size shall be effective
the first day of the next available billing month after the change is reported. Except for changes
occurring from annual cost-of-living increases, a change resulting in an increased premium shall
not affect the premium amount until the next six-month review.
   (h) Premium payment is due upon notification from the commissioner of the premium amount
required. Premiums may be paid in installments at the discretion of the commissioner.
    (i) Nonpayment of the premium shall result in denial or termination of medical assistance
unless the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment. Good cause exists if the requirements
specified in Minnesota Rules, part 9506.0040, subpart 7, items B to D, are met. Except when an
installment agreement is accepted by the commissioner, all persons disenrolled for nonpayment
of a premium must pay any past due premiums as well as current premiums due prior to being
reenrolled. Nonpayment shall include payment with a returned, refused, or dishonored instrument.
The commissioner may require a guaranteed form of payment as the only means to replace a
returned, refused, or dishonored instrument.
    (j) Following a determination that the applicant is not aged or blind and does not meet any other
category of eligibility for medical assistance and has not been determined disabled by the Social
Security Administration, applicants under this subdivision shall be referred to the commissioner's
state medical review team for a determination of disability. Disability shall be determined according
to the rules of title XVI and title XIX of the Social Security Act and pertinent rules and policies of
the Social Security Administration.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.057, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
  Subd. 11. Treatment for colorectal cancer. (a) Medical assistance shall be paid for an individual

project;
   (2) according to the individual's treating health professional, needs treatment for colorectal
cancer;
   (3) meets income eligibility guidelines for the colorectal cancer prevention demonstration
project;
   (4) is under the age of 65; and
   (5) is not otherwise eligible for medical assistance or other creditable coverage as defined under
United States Code, title 42, section 1396a(aa).
   (b) Medical assistance provided under this subdivision shall be limited to services provided
during the period that the individual receives treatment for colorectal cancer.

    (c) An individual meeting the criteria in paragraph (a) is eligible for medical assistance without
meeting the eligibility criteria relating to income and assets in section 256B.056, subdivisions 1a to
5b.
      (d) This subdivision expires December 31, 2010.
      Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0575, is amended to read:
      256B.0575 AVAILABILITY OF INCOME FOR INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS.
    Subdivision 1. Income deductions. When an institutionalized person is determined eligible for
medical assistance, the income that exceeds the deductions in paragraphs (a) and (b) must be applied
to the cost of institutional care.
    (a) The following amounts must be deducted from the institutionalized person's income in the
following order:
    (1) the personal needs allowance under section 256B.35 or, for a veteran who does not have
a spouse or child, or a surviving spouse of a veteran having no child, the amount of an improved
pension received from the veteran's administration not exceeding $90 per month;
      (2) the personal allowance for disabled individuals under section 256B.36;
   (3) if the institutionalized person has a legally appointed guardian or conservator, five
percent of the recipient's gross monthly income up to $100 as reimbursement for guardianship or
conservatorship services;
    (4) a monthly income allowance determined under section 256B.058, subdivision 2, but only to
the extent income of the institutionalized spouse is made available to the community spouse;
    (5) a monthly allowance for children under age 18 which, together with the net income of the
children, would provide income equal to the medical assistance standard for families and children
according to section 256B.056, subdivision 4, for a family size that includes only the minor children.
This deduction applies only if the children do not live with the community spouse and only to the
extent that the deduction is not included in the personal needs allowance under section 256B.35,
subdivision 1, as child support garnished under a court order;
   (6) a monthly family allowance for other family members, equal to one-third of the difference
between 122 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and the monthly income for that family
member;
  (7) reparations payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany and reparations payments
made by the Netherlands for victims of Nazi persecution between 1940 and 1945;
      (8) all other exclusions from income for institutionalized persons as mandated by federal law;
and
    (9) amounts for reasonable expenses as specified in subdivision 2, incurred for necessary medical
or remedial care for the institutionalized person that are recognized under state law, not medical
assistance covered expenses, and ­ht­­  a­

    For purposes of clause (6), "other family member" means a person who resides with the
community spouse and who is a minor or dependent child, dependent parent, or dependent sibling
of either spouse. "Dependent" means a person who could be claimed as a dependent for federal
income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code.
  (b) Income shall be allocated to an institutionalized person for a period of up to three calendar
months, in an amount equal to the medical assistance standard for a family size of one if:
    (1) a physician certifies that the person is expected to reside in the long-term care facility for
three calendar months or less;
     (2) if the person has expenses of maintaining a residence in the community; and
     (3) if one of the following circumstances apply:
    (i) the person was not living together with a spouse or a family member as defined in paragraph
(a) when the person entered a long-term care facility; or
    (ii) the person and the person's spouse become institutionalized on the same date, in which case
the allocation shall be applied to the income of one of the spouses.
For purposes of this paragraph, a person is determined to be residing in a licensed nursing home,
regional treatment center, or medical institution if the person is expected to remain for a period of
one full calendar month or more.
    Subd. 2. Reasonable expenses. For the purposes of subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (9),
reasonable expenses are limited to expenses that have not been previously used as a deduction from
income and were not:
   (1) for long-term care expenses incurred during a period of ineligibility as defined in section
256B.0595, subdivision 2;
    (2) incurred more than three months before the month of application associated with the current
period of eligibility;
   (3) for expenses incurred by a recipient that are duplicative of services that are covered under
chapter 256B; or
   (4) nursing facility expenses incurred without a timely assessment as required under section
256B.0911.
     Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited transfers. (a) For transfers of assets made on or before August 10,
1993, if an institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse has given away, sold, or
disposed of, for less than fair market value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the
homestead that are excluded under the supplemental security program, within 30 months before or
any time after the date of institutionalization if the person has been determined eligible for medical
2964                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [41ST DAY

assistance, or within 30 months before or any time after the date of the first approved application
for medical assistance if the person has not yet been determined eligible for medical assistance, the
person is ineligible for long-term care services for the period of time determined under subdivision
2.
    (b) Effective for transfers made after August 10, 1993, an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or institutionalized person's spouse, may not give away, sell, or dispose of, for less than fair market
value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the homestead that are excluded under
the Supplemental Security Income program, for the purpose of establishing or maintaining medical
assistance eligibility. This applies to all transfers, including those made by a community spouse
after the month in which the institutionalized spouse is determined eligible for medical assistance.
For purposes of determining eligibility for long-term care services, any transfer of such assets
within 36 months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, or 36 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, for less than fair market value may be considered.
Any such transfer is presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing or maintaining
medical assistance eligibility and the institutionalized person is ineligible for long-term care
services for the period of time determined under subdivision 2, unless the institutionalized person
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose,
or unless the transfer is permitted under subdivision 3 or 4. In the case of payments from a trust
or portions of a trust that are considered transfers of assets under federal law, or in the case of
any other disposal of assets made on or after February 8, 2006, any transfers made within 60
months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance payment
of long-term care services and within 60 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, may be considered.
    (c) This section applies to transfers, for less than fair market value, of income or assets, including
assets that are considered income in the month received, such as inheritances, court settlements, and
retroactive benefit payments or income to which the institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse is entitled but does not receive due to action by the institutionalized person, the
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse.
    (d) This section applies to payments for care or personal services provided by a relative, unless
the compensation was stipulated in a notarized, written agreement which was in existence when
the service was performed, the care or services directly benefited the person, and the payments
made represented reasonable compensation for the care or services provided. A notarized written
agreement is not required if payment for the services was made within 60 days after the service was
provided.
    (e) This section applies to the portion of any asset or interest that an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse, transfers to any annuity that exceeds the value of the benefit
likely to be returned to the institutionalized person or institutionalized person's spouse while alive,

based on estimated life expectancy as determined according to the current actuarial tables published
by the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. The commissioner may
adopt rules reducing life expectancies based on the need for long-term care. This section applies to
an annuity purchased on or after March 1, 2002, that:
    (1) is not purchased from an insurance company or financial institution that is subject to licensing
or regulation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce or a similar regulatory agency of another
state;
   (2) does not pay out principal and interest in equal monthly installments; or
   (3) does not begin payment at the earliest possible date after annuitization.
    (f) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person who has applied for or is receiving long-term
care services or the institutionalized person's spouse shall be treated as the disposal of an asset
for less than fair market value unless the department is named a preferred remainder beneficiary
as described in section 256B.056, subdivision 11. Any subsequent change to the designation of the
department as a preferred remainder beneficiary shall result in the annuity being treated as a disposal
of assets for less than fair market value. The amount of such transfer shall be the maximum amount
the institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse could receive from the annuity or
similar financial instrument. Any change in the amount of the income or principal being withdrawn
from the annuity or other similar financial instrument at the time of the most recent disclosure shall
be deemed to be a transfer of assets for less than fair market value unless the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse demonstrates that the transaction was for fair market value. In
the event a distribution of income or principal has been improperly distributed or disbursed from an
annuity or other retirement planning instrument of an institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse, a cause of action exists against the individual receiving the improper distribution
for the cost of medical assistance services provided or the amount of the improper distribution,
whichever is less.
    (g) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person applying for or receiving long-term care
services shall be treated as a disposal of assets for less than fair market value unless it is:
   (i) an annuity described in subsection (b) or (q) of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986; or
   (ii) purchased with proceeds from:
   (A) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
   (B) a simplified employee pension within the meaning of section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code; or
   (C) a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (iii) an annuity that is irrevocable and nonassignable; is actuarially sound as determined in
accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration; and provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity, with

no deferral and no balloon payments made.
    (h) For purposes of this section, long-term care services include services in a nursing facility,
services that are eligible for payment according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 2, because they
are provided in a swing bed, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
and home and community-based services provided pursuant to sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and
256B.49. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, "institutionalized person"
includes a person who is an inpatient in a nursing facility or in a swing bed, or intermediate care
facility for persons with developmental disabilities or who is receiving home and community-based
services under sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and 256B.49.
    (i) This section applies to funds used to purchase a promissory note, loan, or mortgage unless
the note, loan, or mortgage:
   (1) has a repayment term that is actuarially sound;
   (2) provides for payments to be made in equal amounts during the term of the loan, with no
deferral and no balloon payments made; and
   (3) prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the lender.
    In the case of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage that does not meet an exception in clauses (1)
to (3), the value of such note, loan, or mortgage shall be the outstanding balance due as of the date
of the institutionalized person's request for medical assistance payment of long-term care services.
    (j) This section applies to the purchase of a life estate interest in another person's home unless
the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of purchase.
     (k) This section applies to transfers into a pooled trust that qualifies under United States Code,
title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(C), by:
   (1) a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse; or
    (2) any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority to act in place of, on behalf of,
at the direction of, or upon the request of a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Period of ineligibility for long-term care services. (a) For any uncompensated transfer
occurring on or before August 10, 1993, the number of months of ineligibility for long-term care
services shall be the lesser of 30 months, or the uncompensated transfer amount divided by the
average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state in effect on the date of
application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance payment rate shall be
adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year. The period of ineligibility
begins with the month in which the assets were transferred. If the transfer was not reported to the
local agency at the time of application, and the applicant received long-term care services during
what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause of action
exists against the transferee for the cost of long-term care services provided during the period of
ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The uncompensated
transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed
41ST DAY]                           SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                         2967

of, less the amount of compensation received.
     (b) For uncompensated transfers made after August 10, 1993, the number of months of
ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the total uncompensated value of the resources
transferred divided by the average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state
in effect on the date of application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance
payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year.
The period of ineligibility begins with the first day of the month after the month in which the assets
were transferred except that if one or more uncompensated transfers are made during a period
of ineligibility, the total assets transferred during the ineligibility period shall be combined and
a penalty period calculated to begin on the first day of the month after the month in which the
first uncompensated transfer was made. If the transfer was reported to the local agency after the
date that advance notice of a period of ineligibility that affects the next month could be provided
to the recipient and the recipient received medical assistance services or the transfer was not
reported to the local agency, and the applicant or recipient received medical assistance services
during what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause
of action exists against the transferee for that portion of long-term care services provided during
the period of ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The
uncompensated transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away,
sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. Effective for transfers made on
or after March 1, 1996, involving persons who apply for medical assistance on or after April 13,
1996, no cause of action exists for a transfer unless:
    (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was a resident of a long-term care facility or was receiving that level of care in the community at
the time of the transfer;
   (2) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made to assist the
person to qualify for or retain medical assistance eligibility; or
    (3) the transferee actively solicited the transfer with intent to assist the person to qualify for or
retain eligibility for medical assistance.
   (c) For uncompensated transfers made on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility:
    (1) for uncompensated transfers by or on behalf of individuals receiving medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, begins the first day of the month following advance notice of
    p­
the ­ ­­
     en a­t
         l­y­ period of ineligibility, but no later than the first day of the month that follows three full
calendar months from the date of the report or discovery of the transfer; or
    (2) for uncompensated transfers by individuals requesting medical assistance payment of
long-term care services, begins the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance
under the Medicaid state plan and would otherwise be receiving long-term care services based on
an approved application for such care but for the ­

    (e) In the case of multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than one month for less than
fair market value on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility is calculated by treating
the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred during all months on or after
February 8, 2006, as one transfer.
    (f) A period of ineligibility established under paragraph (c) may be eliminated if all of the assets
transferred for less than fair market value used to calculate the period of ineligibility, or cash equal
to the value of the assets at the time of the transfer, are returned within 12 months after the date
the period of ineligibility begins. A period of ineligibility must not be adjusted if less than the full
amounts of the transferred assets or the full cash values of the transferred assets are returned.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for periods of ineligibility established on or after
January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Citizenship requirements. (a) Eligibility for medical assistance is limited to citizens
of the United States, qualified noncitizens as defined in this subdivision, and other persons residing
lawfully in the United States. Citizens or nationals of the United States must cooperate in obtaining
satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship or nationality according to the requirements of the
federal Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Public Law 109-171.
   (b) "Qualified noncitizen" means a person who meets one of the following immigration criteria:
   (1) admitted for lawful permanent residence according to United States Code, title 8;
   (2) admitted to the United States as a refugee according to United States Code, title 8, section
1157;
   (3) granted asylum according to United States Code, title 8, section 1158;

   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13e. Payment rates. (a) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the
lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable
cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the
usual and customary price charged to the public. The amount of payment basis must be reduced
to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any provider/insurer agreement or contract
for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater
than the patient liability for the service. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.65, except that
the dispensing fee for intravenous solutions which must be compounded by the pharmacist shall
be $8 per bag, $14 per bag for cancer chemotherapy products, and $30 per bag for total parenteral
nutritional products dispensed in one liter quantities, or $44 per bag for total parenteral nutritional

acquisition cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus
­­
1 4 15 percent. The actual acquisition cost of antihemophilic factor drugs shall be estimated at the
average wholesale price minus 30 percent. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug
may be set by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum
amount paid by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs.
Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act.
   (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists

for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.
    (c) Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the
actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, or on the maximum allowable cost established by the
commissioner.
    (d) The basis for determining the amount of payment for drugs administered in an outpatient
setting shall be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider or the amount
established for Medicare by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant
to title XVIII, section 1847a of the federal Social Security Act.
    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of
cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology
drugs, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex care. The commissioner shall consult
with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty pharmacy products subject to this
paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in developing this list, the commissioner
shall take into consideration the population served by specialty pharmacy products, the current
delivery system and standard of care in the state, and access to care issues. The commissioner shall
have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate to prevent access to care issues.

coordination team; and
      (4) make use of an electronic patient record system that meets state standards.
   (c) For purposes of reimbursement for medication therapy management services, the
commissioner may enroll individual pharmacists as medical assistance and general assistance

    (d) The commissioner shall establish a pilot project for an intensive medication therapy
management program for patients identified by the commissioner with multiple chronic conditions
and a high number of medications who are at high risk of preventable hospitalizations, emergency
room use, medication complications, and suboptimal treatment outcomes due to medication-related
problems. For purposes of the pilot project, medication therapy management services may be
provided in a patient's home or community setting, in addition to other authorized settings. The
commissioner may waive existing payment policies and establish special payment rates for the
pilot project. The pilot project must be designed to produce a net savings to the state compared to
the estimated costs that would otherwise be incurred for similar patients without the program.

commissioner shall establish a collaborative psychiatric consultation service to be available via
telephone, interactive video, e-mail, facsimile, or other means of communication to primary care

was well as adult psychiatrists. The first priority for this service shall be to provide the consultations
required under paragraph (b).
    (b) The commissioner shall require prior authorization and a collaborative psychiatric
consultation for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and attention deficit disorder
(ADD) medication and psychotropic medication prescribed to children under the following
circumstances:
   (1) prior authorization and a collaborative consultation from a commissioner-approved provider
shall be required when ADD or ADHD medication is prescribed to children under five years of age;
    (2) a collaborative consultation from a commissioner-approved provider shall be required when
ADD or ADHD medication is prescribed for children five years of age and under 18 years of age
for ADHD medications if the prescribed amount exceeds the following dosages:
      (i) methylphenidates 120 mg/day;
      (ii) dexmethylphenidates 60 mg/day;
      (iii) amphetamines 60 mg/day; and

The commissioner shall periodically review the list of medications included in this paragraph
and update the medications and dosages listed as needed, in accordance with the requirements in
subdivision 13f, paragraph (b);
   (3) prior authorization and a collaborative consultation from a commissioner-approved provider
shall be required when more than one type of medication identified in clause (2) is prescribed at one
time to a child under the age of 18; and
    (4) a collaborative consultation from a commissioner-approved provider shall be required if any
of the following conditions apply:
   (i) the absence of a DSM-IV diagnosis in the child's claim record;
   (ii) five or more psychotropic medications prescribed concomitantly after 60 days;
   (iii) two or more concomitant antipsychotic medications after 60 days;
   (iv) three or more concomitant mood stabilizer medications for a mental health diagnosis after

diagnosed mental disorder or with documented target symptoms associated with a therapeutic
response to the medication prescribed; and
   (vi) psychotropic medications prescribed for children under five years of age.
The commissioner may establish threshold amounts for identified psychotropic medications that, if
exceeded, may require a collaborative consultation from a commissioner-approved provider.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Transportation costs. (a) Medical assistance covers medical transportation costs
incurred solely for obtaining emergency medical care or transportation costs incurred by eligible
persons in obtaining emergency or nonemergency medical care when paid directly to an ambulance
company, common carrier, or other recognized providers of transportation services. Medical
transportation must be provided by:
   (1) an ambulance, as defined in section 144E.001, subdivision 2;
   (2) special transportation; or
    (3) common carrier including, but not limited to, bus, taxicab, other commercial carrier, or
private automobile.
    (b) Medical assistance covers special transportation, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part
9505.0315, subpart 1, item F, if the recipient has a physical or mental impairment that would
prohibit the recipient from safely accessing and using a bus, taxi, other commercial transportation,
or private automobile.
The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation ­n i­­   ­­

   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 25a. Prior authorization of diagnostic imaging services. (a) Effective January 1,
2010, the commissioner shall require prior authorization or decision support for the ordering
providers at the time the service is ordered for the following outpatient diagnostic imaging
services: computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA), positive emission tomography (PET), cardiac imaging and ultrasound
diagnostic imaging.
    (b) Prior authorization under this subdivision is not required for diagnostic imaging services
performed as part of a hospital emergency room visit, inpatient hospitalization, or if concurrent
with or on the same day as an urgent care facility visit.
   (c) This subdivision does not apply to services provided to recipients who are enrolled in
Medicare, the prepaid medical assistance program, the prepaid general assistance medical care
program, or the MinnesotaCare program.
    (d) The commissioner may contract with a private entity to provide the prior authorization or
decision support required under this subdivision. The contracting entity must incorporate clinical
guidelines that are based on evidence-based medical literature, if available. By January 1, 2012,
the contracting entity shall report to the commissioner the results of prior authorization or decision
support.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Special education services. (a) Medical assistance covers medical services identified
in a recipient's individualized education plan and covered under the medical assistance state
plan. Covered services include occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language therapy,
clinical psychological services, nursing services, school psychological services, school social
work services, personal care assistants serving as management aides, assistive technology devices,
transportation services, health assessments, and other services covered under the medical assistance
state plan. Mental health services eligible for medical assistance reimbursement must be provided
or coordinated through a children's mental health collaborative where a collaborative exists if the
child is included in the collaborative operational target population. The provision or coordination
of services does not require that the individual education plan be developed by the collaborative.
     The services may be provided by a Minnesota school district that is enrolled as a medical
assistance provider or its subcontractor, and only if the services meet all the requirements otherwise
applicable if the service had been provided by a provider other than a school district, in the
following areas: medical necessity, physician's orders, documentation, personnel qualifications,
and prior authorization requirements. The nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this
subdivision is the responsibility of the local school district as provided in section 125A.74. Services
listed in a child's individual education plan are eligible for medical assistance reimbursement only
if those services meet criteria for federal financial participation under the Medicaid program.
   (b) Approval of health-related services for inclusion in the individual education plan does not
require prior authorization for purposes of reimbursement under this chapter. The commissioner
may require physician review and approval of the plan not more than once annually or upon any
modification of the individual education plan that reflects a change in health-related services.

   (c) Services of a speech-language pathologist provided under this section are covered
notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0390, subpart 1, item L, if the person:
   (1) holds a masters degree in speech-language pathology;
   (2) is licensed by the Minnesota Board of Teaching as an educational speech-language
pathologist; and
    (3) either has a certificate of clinical competence from the American Speech and Hearing
Association, has completed the equivalent educational requirements and work experience necessary
for the certificate or has completed the academic program and is acquiring supervised work
experience to qualify for the certificate.
    (d) Medical assistance coverage for medically necessary services provided under other
subdivisions in this section may not be denied solely on the basis that the same or similar services
are covered under this subdivision.
    (e) The commissioner shall develop and implement package rates, bundled rates, or per diem
rates for special education services under which separately covered services are grouped together
and billed as a unit in order to reduce administrative complexity.
    (f) The commissioner shall develop a cost-based payment structure for payment of these services.
The commissioner shall reimburse claims submitted based on an interim rate, and shall settle at a
final rate once the department has determined it. The commissioner shall notify the school district
of the final rate. The school district has 60 days to appeal the final rate. To appeal the final rate, the
school district shall file a written appeal request to the commissioner within 60 days of the date the
final rate determination was mailed. The appeal request shall specify (1) the disputed items and (2)
the name and address of the person to contact regarding the appeal.
    (g) Effective July 1, 2000, medical assistance services provided under an individual education
plan or an individual family service plan by local school districts shall not count against medical
assistance authorization thresholds for that child.
    (h) Nursing services as defined in section 148.171, subdivision 15, and provided as an
individual education plan health-related service, are eligible for medical assistance payment if they
are otherwise a covered service under the medical assistance program. Medical assistance covers
the administration of prescription medications by a licensed nurse who is employed by or under
contract with a school district when the administration of medications is identified in the child's
individualized education plan. The simple administration of medications alone is not covered under
medical assistance when administered by a provider other than a school district or when it is not
identified in the child's individualized education plan.

41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                        2981

    (a) The commissioner shall implement a demonstration project for enrollees in medical
assistance or general assistance medical care who have or are at risk of developing diabetes.
The project shall be designed as a podiatry-directed wound care program that focuses on the
prevention and care of diabetic-related wounds in order to reduce wound treatment costs and
prevent amputations.
    (b) The commissioner, in consultation with the Minnesota Podiatric Medical Association, shall
develop the request for proposals to be submitted by providers or groups of providers by November

   (2) patient education and training;
   (3) patient evaluation and assessments;
    (4) new wound diagnostic, treatment, and prevention technologies using best practices in wound
treatment;
   (5) an electronic reporting system for patient measurement, monitoring, and reporting; and
   (6) a process for documenting patient compliance and satisfaction.
    (c) The commissioner may establish minimum standards for quality care that must be met by
participating providers and must establish quality measurements for the project.
    (d) The project shall provide podiatric wound care to at least 1,000 enrollees for a two-year
period. To the extent possible, the commissioner shall include enrollees throughout the state.
   (e) The commissioner shall report to the legislature by January 15, 2013, the status of the
demonstration project, including the number of patients, patient compliance, patient satisfaction,
amputation data, and cost-savings data related to drug utilization and treatment-related costs.
   (f) The commissioner shall seek any federal waivers necessary to obtain federal matching funds.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Social Security data. The commissioner shall accept data received from the Social
Security Administration as an application for medical assistance in accordance with United States
Code, title 42, section 1396u-5(a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Policy and applicability. (a) It is the policy of this state that individuals or
couples, either or both of whom participate in the medical assistance program, use their own assets to
pay their share of the total cost of their care during or after their enrollment in the program according
to applicable federal law and the laws of this state. The following provisions apply:
   (1) subdivisions 1c to 1k shall not apply to claims arising under this section which are presented
under section 525.313;
   (2) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k expanding the interests included in an estate for

purposes of recovery under this section give effect to the provisions of United States Code, title 42,
section 1396p, governing recoveries, but do not give rise to any express or implied liens in favor of
any other parties not named in these provisions;
    (3) the continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property after
the recipient's death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance under this section modifies
common law principles holding that these interests terminate on the death of the holder;
   (4) all laws, rules, and regulations governing or involved with a recovery of medical assistance
shall be liberally construed to accomplish their intended purposes;
    (5) a deceased recipient's life estate and joint tenancy interests continued under this section shall
be owned by the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear on the date
of the recipient's death. They shall not be merged into the remainder interest or the interests of the
surviving joint tenants by reason of ownership. They shall be subject to the provisions of this section.
Any conveyance, transfer, sale, assignment, or encumbrance by a remainderman, a surviving joint
tenant, or their heirs, successors, and assigns shall be deemed to include all of their interest in the
deceased recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest continued under this section; and
    (6) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k continuing a recipient's joint tenancy interests in
real property after the recipient's death do not apply to a homestead owned of record, on the date the
recipient dies, by the recipient and the recipient's spouse as joint tenants with a right of survivorship.
Homestead means the real property occupied by the surviving joint tenant spouse as their sole
residence on the date the recipient dies and classified and taxed to the recipient and surviving joint
tenant spouse as homestead property for property tax purposes in the calendar year in which the
recipient dies. For purposes of this exemption, real property the recipient and their surviving joint
tenant spouse purchase solely with the proceeds from the sale of their prior homestead, own of
record as joint tenants, and qualify as homestead property under section 273.124 in the calendar
year in which the recipient dies and prior to the recipient's death shall be deemed to be real property
classified and taxed to the recipient and their surviving joint tenant spouse as homestead property
in the calendar year in which the recipient dies. The surviving spouse, or any person with personal
knowledge of the facts, may provide an affidavit describing the homestead property affected by
this clause and stating facts showing compliance with this clause. The affidavit shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts it states.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "medical assistance" includes the medical assistance program
under this chapter and the general assistance medical care program under chapter 256D and
alternative care for nonmedical assistance recipients under section 256B.0913.
  (c) For purposes of this section, beginning January 1, 2010, "medical assistance" does not include
Medicare cost-sharing benefits in accordance with United States Code, title 42, section 1396p.
    (d) All provisions in this subdivision, and subdivisions 1d, 1f, 1g, 1h, 1i, and 1j, related to the
continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property after the recipient's
death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance, are effective only for life estates and joint
tenancy interests established on or after August 1, 2003. For purposes of this paragraph, medical
assistance does not include alternative care.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                        2983

in beneficiary form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's
death, to the extent the interests or proceeds of those interests become part of the probate estate
under section 524.6-307;
   (4) all of the person's interests in joint accounts, multiple-party accounts, and pay-on-death
accounts, brokerage accounts, investment accounts, or the proceeds of those accounts, as provided
under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death to the extent the interests
become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and
    (5) assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the person through survivorship, living trust,
or other arrangements.
    (c) For the purpose of this section and recovery in a surviving spouse's estate for medical
assistance paid for a predeceased spouse, the estate must consist of all of the legal title and interests
the deceased individual's predeceased spouse had in jointly owned or marital property at the time
of the spouse's death, as defined in subdivision 2b, and the proceeds of those interests, that passed
to the deceased individual or another individual, a survivor, an heir, or an assign of the predeceased
spouse through a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other
arrangement. A deceased recipient who, at death, owned the property jointly with the surviving
spouse shall have an interest in the entire property.
    (d) For the purpose of recovery in a single person's estate or the estate of a survivor of a married
couple, "other arrangement" includes any other means by which title to all or any part of the jointly
owned or marital property or interest passed from the predeceased spouse to another including, but
not limited to, transfers between spouses that are permitted, prohibited, or penalized for purposes
of medical assistance.
    (e) A claim shall be filed if medical assistance was rendered for either or both persons under one
of the following circumstances:

   (­) (1) the person was over 55 years of age, and received services under this chapter;
    a­
   ­

        c­
    (f) The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent for the purpose of
section 524.3-805. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency with a
claim under this section must be a creditor under section 524.6-307. Any statute of limitations that
purports to limit any county agency or the state agency, or both, to recover for medical assistance
granted hereunder shall not apply to any claim made hereunder for reimbursement for any medical
assistance granted hereunder. Notice of the claim shall be given to all heirs and devisees of the
decedent whose identity can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The notice must include

interest in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985
on the date of the person's death shall not end upon the person's death and shall continue as provided
in this subdivision. The life estate in the person's estate shall be that portion of the interest in the real
property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate
as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who
was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy
interest in real property in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest the person would have
owned in the jointly held interest in the property had they and the other owners held title to the
property as tenants in common on the date the person died.

tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash
the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal
representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to,

owners, remaindermen, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's
estate's interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others,
if the personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the
estate has other assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement

the estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen

property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.
    Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

shall not include interest. Claims that have been allowed but not paid shall bear interest according
to section 524.3-806, paragraph (d). A claim against the estate of a surviving spouse who did not
receive medical assistance, for medical assistance rendered for the predeceased spouse, shall be
payable from the full value of all of the predeceased spouse's assets and interests that are part of the
surviving spouse's estate under subdivisions 1a and 2b. Recovery of medical assistance expenses
in the nonrecipient surviving spouse's estate is limited to the value of the assets of the estate that
were marital property or jointly owned property at any time during the marriage. The claim is not
payable from the value of assets or proceeds of assets in the estate attributable to a predeceased
spouse whom the individual married after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse for whom
the claim is filed or from assets and the proceeds of assets in the estate which the nonrecipient
decedent spouse acquired with assets which were not marital property or jointly owned property
after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse. Claims for alternative care shall be net of all
premiums paid under section 256B.0913, subdivision 12, on or after July 1, 2003, and shall be

limited to services provided on or after July 1, 2003. Claims against marital property shall be
limited to claims against recipients who died on or after July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Controlling provisions. (a) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 1a and
2, paragraphs (b) to (d) apply.
    (b) At the time of death of a recipient spouse and solely for purpose of recovery of medical
assistance benefits received, a predeceased recipient spouse shall have a legal title or interest in
the undivided whole of all of the property which the recipient and the recipient's surviving spouse
owned jointly or which was marital property at any time during their marriage regardless of the
form of ownership and regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both
the recipient and the recipient's spouse. Title and interest in the property of a predeceased recipient
spouse shall not end or extinguish upon the person's death and shall continue for the purpose of
allowing recovery of medical assistance in the estate of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the
predeceased recipient spouse, title and interest in the predeceased spouse's property shall vest in the
surviving spouse by operation of law and without the necessity for any probate or decree of descent
proceedings and shall continue to exist after the death of the predeceased spouse and the surviving
spouse to permit recovery of medical assistance. The recipient spouse and the surviving spouse of a
deceased recipient spouse shall not encumber, disclaim, transfer, alienate, hypothecate, or otherwise
divest themselves of these interests before or upon death.
    (c) For purposes of this section, "marital property" includes any and all real or personal property
of any kind or interests in such property the predeceased recipient spouse and their spouse, or
either of them, owned at the time of their marriage to each other or acquired during their marriage
regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both of them. If either or both
spouses of a married couple received medical assistance, all property owned during the marriage or
which either or both spouses acquired during their marriage shall be presumed to be marital property
for purposes of recovering medical assistance unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the
contrary.
     (d) The agency responsible for the claim for medical assistance for a recipient spouse may, at
its discretion, release specific real and personal property from the provisions of this section. The
release shall extinguish the interest created under paragraph (b) in the land it describes upon filing
or recording. The release need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of filing
or recording and shall be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles,
as appropriate, in the county where the real property is located. The party to whom the release is
given shall be responsible for paying all fees and costs necessary to record and file the release. If
the property described in the release is registered property, the registrar of titles shall accept it for
recording and shall record it on the certificate of title for each parcel of property described in the
release. If the property described in the release is abstract property, the recorder shall accept it for
filing and file it in the county's grantor-grantee indexes and any tract index the county maintains for
each parcel of property described in the release.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Commissioner's intervention. The commissioner shall be permitted to intervene as a
party in any proceeding involving recovery of medical assistance upon filing a notice of intervention
and serving such notice on the other parties.
2988                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [41ST DAY

   Sec. 51. [256B.196] INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS; HOSPITAL PAYMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Federal approval required. This section is contingent on federal approval of
the intergovernmental transfers and payments authorized under this section. This section is also
contingent on current payment by the government entities of the intergovernmental transfers under
this section.
    Subd. 2. Commissioner's duties. (a) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3,
the commissioner shall determine the fee-for-service outpatient hospital services upper payment
limit for nonstate government hospitals. The commissioner shall then determine the amount of
a supplemental payment to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital for these
services that would increase medical assistance spending in this category to the aggregate upper
payment limit for all nonstate government hospitals in Minnesota. In making this determination,
the commissioner shall allot the available increases between Hennepin County Medical Center
and Regions Hospital based on the ratio of medical assistance fee-for-service outpatient hospital
payments to the two facilities. The commissioner shall adjust this allotment as necessary based on
federal approvals, the amount of intergovernmental transfers received from Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties, and other factors, in order to maximize the additional total payments. The commissioner
shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic intergovernmental transfers
necessary to match federal Medicaid payments available under this subdivision in order to make
supplementary medical assistance payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions
Hospital equal to an amount that when combined with existing medical assistance payments
to nonstate governmental hospitals would increase total payments to hospitals in this category
for outpatient services to the aggregate upper payment limit for all hospitals in this category in
Minnesota. Upon receipt of these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary
payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3, the commissioner shall determine
an upper payment limit for physicians affiliated with Hennepin County Medical Center and
with Regions Hospital. The upper payment limit shall be based on the average commercial rate
or be determined using another method acceptable to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic
intergovernmental transfers necessary to match the federal Medicaid payments available under
this subdivision in order to make supplementary payments to physicians affiliated with Hennepin
County Medical Center and Regions Hospital equal to the difference between the established
medical assistance payment for physician services and the upper payment limit. Upon receipt of
these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary payments to physicians of
Hennepin Faculty Associates and HealthPartners.
    (c) Beginning January 1, 2010, Hennepin County and Ramsey County shall each make monthly
intergovernmental transfers to the commissioner in an amount determined by each county. The
commissioner shall increase the medical assistance capitation payments to Metropolitan Health Plan
and HealthPartners by an amount equal to the annual value of the monthly transfers plus federal
financial participation.
    (d) The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County on an ongoing basis of
the need for any changes needed in the intergovernmental transfers in order to continue the payments
under paragraphs (a) to (c), at their maximum level, including increases in upper payment limits,
changes in the federal Medicaid match, and other factors.
41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                      2989

   (e) The payments in paragraphs (a) to (c) shall be implemented independently of each other,
subject to federal approval and to the receipt of transfers under subdivision 3.
    Subd. 3. Intergovernmental transfers. Based on the determination by the commissioner
under subdivision 2, Hennepin County and Ramsey County shall make periodic intergovernmental
transfers to the commissioner for the purposes of subdivision 2, paragraphs (a) to (c). All of the
intergovernmental transfers made by Hennepin County shall be used to match federal payments to
Hennepin County Medical Center under subdivision 2, paragraph (a); to physicians affiliated with
Hennepin Faculty Associates under subdivision 2, paragraph (b); and to Metropolitan Health Plan
under subdivision 2, paragraph (c). All of the intergovernmental transfers made by Ramsey County
shall be used to match federal payments to Regions Hospital under subdivision 2, paragraph (a); to
physicians affiliated with HealthPartners under subdivision 2, paragraph (b); and to HealthPartners
under subdivision 2, paragraph (c).
    Subd. 4. Adjustments permitted. (a) The commissioner may adjust the intergovernmental
transfers under subdivision 3 and the payments under subdivision 2, based on the commissioner's
determination of Medicare upper payment limits, hospital-specific charge limits, hospital-specific
limitations on disproportionate share payments, medical inflation, actuarial certification, and
cost-effectiveness for purposes of federal waivers. Any adjustments must be made on a proportional
basis. The commissioner may make adjustments under this subdivision only after consultation with
the affected counties and hospitals. All payments under subdivision 2 and all intergovernmental
transfers under subdivision 3 are limited to amounts available after all other base rates, adjustments,
and supplemental payments in chapter 256B are calculated.
    (b) The ratio of medical assistance payments specified in subdivision 2 to the voluntary
intergovernmental transfers specified in subdivision 3 shall not be reduced except as provided
under paragraph (a).
    Subd. 5. Recession period. Each type of intergovernmental transfer in subdivision 2, paragraphs
(a) to (d), for payment periods from October 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, is voluntary on
the part of Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, meaning that the transfer must be agreed to, in writing,
by the counties prior to any payments being issued. One agreement on each type of transfer shall
cover the entire recession period.

money expected to be available in the current federal fiscal year.
   (c) The commissioner shall apply for federal matching funds for general assistance medical care
expenditures as follows:
   (1) for hospital services occurring on or after July 1, 2007, general assistance medical care
expenditures for fee-for-service inpatient and outpatient hospital payments made by the department
shall be used to apply for federal matching funds, except as limited below:
   (i) only those general assistance medical care expenditures made to an individual hospital that
would not cause the hospital to exceed its individual hospital limits under section 1923 of the Social
Security Act may be considered; and
   (ii) general assistance medical care expenditures may be considered only to the extent of
Minnesota's aggregate allotment under section 1923 of the Social Security Act; and
    (2) all hospitals must provide any necessary expenditure, cost, and revenue information required
by the commissioner as necessary for purposes of obtaining federal Medicaid matching funds for
general assistance medical care expenditures.
    (d) For the period from April 1, 2009, to September 30, 2010, the commissioner shall apply
for additional federal matching funds available as disproportionate share hospital payments under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These funds shall be made available as
the state share of payments under section 256.969, subdivision 28. The entities required to report
certified public expenditures under paragraph (b), clause (1), shall report additional certified public
expenditures as necessary under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and sections
256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing
plan's payment rate under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance and general
assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each performance
target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case

of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each
performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across
a broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement
of plan efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The
commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting
only one plan, including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must
be returned no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23.

the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (c).
    (e) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (c) a reduction in the health plan's emergency
room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from
the plan's utilization rate for state health care program enrollees for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
     The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the managed care plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
is reduced by 25 percent of the managed care plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health
care program enrollees for calendar year 2008.
    (f) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may
include as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this subdivision that
is reasonably expected to be returned.

reduced 6.3 percent for Hennepin County, two percent for the remaining metropolitan counties,
and no reduction for nonmetropolitan Minnesota counties; and after January 1, 2002, the
county medical assistance and general assistance medical care capitation base rate prior to plan
specific adjustments is reduced 6.3 percent for Hennepin County, two percent for the remaining
metropolitan counties, and 1.6 percent for nonmetropolitan Minnesota counties. Nursing facility
and elderly waiver payments and demonstration project payments operating under subdivision 23

    (b) This subdivision shall be effective upon approval of a federal waiver which allows federal
financial participation in the medical education and research fund. Effective July 1, 2009, and
thereafter, the transfers required by paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (4), shall not exceed the total
amount transferred for fiscal year 2009. Any excess shall first reduce the amounts otherwise
required to be transferred under paragraph (a), clauses (2) to (4). Any excess following this
reduction shall proportionally reduce the transfers under paragraph (a), clause (1).
   (c) Effective July 1, 2003, the amount reduced from the prepaid general assistance medical care
payments under paragraph (a), clause (1), shall be transferred to the general fund.
    (d) Beginning July 1, 2009, of the amounts in paragraph (a), the commissioner shall transfer
$21,714,000 each fiscal year to the medical education and research fund. The balance of the transfers
under paragraph (a) shall be transferred to the medical education and research fund no earlier than
July 1 of the following fiscal year.
   Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5f, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5f. Capitation rates. (a) Beginning July 1, 2002, the capitation rates paid under this
section are increased by $12,700,000 per year. Beginning July 1, 2003, the capitation rates paid
under this section are increased by $4,700,000 per year.
    (b) Beginning July 1, 2009, the capitation rates paid under this section are increased each year

the reductions described in subdivision 5c, paragraph (a), clause (1), and the amount of the limit
described in subdivision 5c, paragraph (b).

shall be responsible for the health care coordination for eligible individuals. Demonstration
providers:
    (1) shall authorize and arrange for the provision of all needed health services including but
not limited to the full range of services listed in sections 256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625
in order to ensure appropriate health care is delivered to enrollees. Notwithstanding section
256B.0621, demonstration providers that provide nursing home and community-based services
under this section shall provide relocation service coordination to enrolled persons age 65 and over;
    (2) shall accept the prospective, per capita payment from the commissioner in return for the
provision of comprehensive and coordinated health care services for eligible individuals enrolled in
the program;
   (3) may contract with other health care and social service practitioners to provide services to
enrollees; and
   (4) shall institute recipient grievance procedures according to the method established by the
project, utilizing applicable requirements of chapter 62D. Disputes not resolved through this process
shall be appealable to the commissioner as provided in subdivision 11.
    (b) Demonstration providers must comply with the standards for claims settlement under section
72A.201, subdivisions 4, 5, 7, and 8, when contracting with other health care and social service
practitioners to provide services to enrollees. A demonstration provider must pay a clean claim, as
defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 447.45(b), within 30 business days of the
date of acceptance of the claim.
    (c) A demonstration provider shall not authorize, arrange, or provide dental services listed under
section 256B.0625; 256D.03, subdivision 4; or 256L.03, as part of the comprehensive health care
services that are required to be provided by the demonstration provider under this section. Dental
services shall be reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis.
   Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right

to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner

must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated

to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for
home and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would
have been incurred under the fee-for-service program. In determining MnDHO payment rates
and risk adjustment methods, the commissioner must consider the methods used to determine
county allocations for home and community-based program participants. If necessary to reduce
MnDHO rates to comply with this provision, the commissioner must implement successive overall
rate-to-rate reductions not including any other reductions provided by law. The rate reductions must
not exceed ten percent in any calendar year. In developing program specifications for expansion
of integrated programs, the commissioner shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder
group established in subdivision 28, paragraph (d), including consultation on whether and how
to include home and community-based waiver programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO
projects shall be presented to the chairs of the house of representatives and senate committees with
jurisdiction over health and human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.
   Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

plan must either contract with or establish a birthing center for the provision of obstetric services
that are covered under section 256B.0625 and are provided by a birthing center. The birthing center
must be licensed under section 144.566.

Minnesota, the commissioner shall consider the risks the prepaid program creates for the hospital
and allow the county or hospital the opportunity to participate in the program in a manner that

considering the nature of the population served. Payment for services provided pursuant to this
subdivision shall be as provided to medical assistance vendors of these services under sections

coverage and the commissioner shall use cost avoidance techniques to ensure coordination of any
other health coverage for eligible persons. The commissioner shall identify eligible persons who
may have coverage or benefits under other plans of insurance or who become eligible for medical
assistance.
   (e) The effective date of coverage for single adults and households with no children formerly
enrolled in general assistance medical care and enrolled in MinnesotaCare according to section
256D.03, subdivision 3, is the first day of the month following the last day of general assistance

    Subd. 3a. Renewal of eligibility. (a) Beginning July 1, 2007, an enrollee's eligibility must be
renewed every 12 months. The 12-month period begins in the month after the month the application
is approved.
    (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The commissioner may establish criteria and timelines for sites to
forward applications to the commissioner or county agencies. The premium for the new period of
eligibility must be received as provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
    (c) For single adults and households with no children formerly enrolled in general assistance
medical care and enrolled in MinnesotaCare according to section 256D.03, subdivision 3, the first
period of eligibility begins the month the enrollee submitted the application or renewal for general
assistance medical care.

                  ­­e Notwithstanding paragraph (e), an enrollee who fails to submit renewal forms
and related documentation necessary for verification of continued eligibility in a timely manner
shall remain eligible for one additional month beyond the end of the current eligibility period before
being disenrolled. The enrollee remains responsible for MinnesotaCare premiums for the additional
month.
     (e) Children in families with family income equal to or below 275 percent of federal poverty
guidelines who fail to submit renewal forms and related documentation necessary for verification
of continued eligibility in a timely manner shall remain eligible for the program. The commissioner
shall use the means described in subdivision 2 or any other means available to verify family income.
If the commissioner determines that there has been a change in income in which premium payment
is required to remain enrolled, the commissioner shall notify the family of the premium payment,
and that the children will be disenrolled if the premium payment is not received effective the first
day of the calendar month following the calendar month for which the premium is due.
    (f) For children enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.07, subdivision 8, the first period
of renewal begins the month the enrollee turns 21 years of age.
   Sec. 71. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Delayed verification. On the basis of information provided on the application, a
child whose family gross income is less than 90 percent of the applicable income standard shall
be determined eligible beginning in the month of application. The child must provide all required
verifications within 60 days' notice of the eligibility determination or eligibility shall be terminated.
Applicants who are terminated for failure to provide all required verifications are not eligible to
apply for coverage using the delayed verification procedures specified in this subdivision for 12
months.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later.

    Subd. 2. Must not have access to employer-subsidized coverage. (a) To be eligible, a family
or individual must not have access to subsidized health coverage through an employer and must not
have had access to employer-subsidized coverage through a current employer for 18 months prior
to application or reapplication. A family or individual whose employer-subsidized coverage is lost
due to an employer terminating health care coverage as an employee benefit during the previous 18
months is not eligible.
    (b) This subdivision does not apply to a family or individual who was enrolled in MinnesotaCare
within six months or less of reapplication and who no longer has employer-subsidized coverage due
to the employer terminating health care coverage as an employee benefit. This subdivision does not
apply to children with family gross incomes that are equal to or less than 200 percent of federal
poverty guidelines.

a higher percentage as specified by the commissioner. Children are eligible for employer-subsidized
coverage through either parent, including the noncustodial parent. The commissioner must treat
employer contributions to Internal Revenue Code Section 125 plans and any other employer benefits
intended to pay health care costs as qualified employer subsidies toward the cost of health coverage

have other health insurance, are eligible if the coverage:
    (1) lacks two or more of the following:
    (i) basic hospital insurance;
    (ii) medical-surgical insurance;
    (iii) prescription drug coverage;
    (iv) dental coverage; or
    (v) vision coverage;
    (2) requires a deductible of $100 or more per person per year; or
   (3) lacks coverage because the child has exceeded the maximum coverage for a particular
diagnosis or the policy excludes a particular diagnosis.
    The commissioner may change this eligibility criterion for sliding scale premiums in order to
remain within the limits of available appropriations. The requirement of no health coverage does
not apply to newborns.
   (b) Medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Service, CHAMPUS, or other coverage provided under United States
Code, title 10, subtitle A, part II, chapter 55, are not considered insurance or health coverage for
purposes of the four-month requirement described in this subdivision.

or enrolled in Medicare Part B coverage under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, United States
Code, title 42, sections 1395c to 1395w-152, is considered to have health coverage. An applicant or
enrollee who is entitled to premium-free Medicare Part A may not refuse to apply for or enroll in
Medicare coverage to establish eligibility for MinnesotaCare.

within one month of application must meet the provisions of this subdivision and subdivision 2.

health coverage for purposes of the four-month requirement under this section, except if the
insurance continued after medical assistance no longer considered it cost-effective or after medical
assistance closed.
   Sec. 75. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Automatic eligibility for certain children. Any child who was residing in foster care
or a juvenile residential correctional facility on the child's 18th birthday is automatically deemed
eligible for MinnesotaCare upon termination or release until the child reaches the age of 21, and
is exempt from the requirements of this section and section 256L.15. Any child eligible under this
subdivision must fill out an application and must submit a renewal every 12 months.
   Sec. 76. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Medical assistance rate to be used. (a) Payment to providers under sections
256L.01 to 256L.11 shall be at the same rates and conditions established for medical assistance,

    (b) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2009, total payments for basic care services
shall be reduced by three percent, in accordance with section 256B.766. Payments made to managed
care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after October 1, 2009, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 77. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.12, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Managed care plan vendor requirements. The following requirements apply to all
counties or vendors who contract with the Department of Human Services to serve MinnesotaCare
recipients. Managed care plan contractors:
   (1) shall authorize and arrange for the provision of the full range of services listed in section
256L.03 in order to ensure appropriate health care is delivered to enrollees with the exception of
dental services, which shall be provided on a fee-for-service basis;
    (2) shall accept the prospective, per capita payment or other contractually defined payment from
the commissioner in return for the provision and coordination of covered health care services for
eligible individuals enrolled in the program;
   (3) may contract with other health care and social service practitioners to provide services to
enrollees;
    (4) shall provide for an enrollee grievance process as required by the commissioner and set forth

        ) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments and county-based purchasing plan payments under this
section pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable,
objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based
on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be
outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and
no later than July 31 of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. A    ­­­

   (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall withhold an
additional three percent of managed care plan payments under this section. The withheld funds
must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the following calendar year.
The return of the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b).
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2010, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the plan's emergency room
utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from the
plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
      The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
41ST DAY]                         SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009                                      3009

until the managed care plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
is reduced by 25 percent of the managed care plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health
care program enrollees for calendar year 2008.
    (e) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include
as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this section that is reasonably
expected to be returned.
   Sec. 79. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. Until June 30, 2009, the sliding fee scale begins with a
premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families
with incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in
effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1,
1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family
size of five. The sliding fee scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five.
The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.
    (b) Children in families whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge
for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum
premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and
administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of
the total. The costs of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and
the enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two
enrollees shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or
more enrollees shall be three times the maximum premium for one.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2009, MinnesotaCare enrollees shall pay premiums according to the
premium scale specified in paragraph (d) with the exception that children in families with income
            ­5
at or below 1­0­ 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines shall pay ­

OTHER ENTITIES.] Any expenditures from
the TANF block grant shall be expended
in accordance with the requirements and
limitations of part A of title IV of the
Social Security Act, as amended, and any
other applicable federal requirement or
limitation. Prior to any expenditure of these
funds, the commissioner shall assure that
funds are expended in compliance with the
requirements and limitations of federal law
and that any reporting requirements of federal
3014                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [41ST DAY

law are met. It shall be the responsibility
of any entity to which these funds are
appropriated to implement a memorandum
of understanding with the commissioner
that provides the necessary assurance of
compliance prior to any expenditure of funds.
The commissioner shall receipt TANF funds
appropriated to other state agencies and
coordinate all related interagency accounting
transactions necessary to implement these
appropriations. Unexpended TANF funds
appropriated to any state, local, or nonprofit
entity cancel at the end of the state fiscal
year unless appropriating language permits
otherwise.
[TANF FUNDS TRANSFERRED TO
OTHER FEDERAL GRANTS.] The
commissioner must authorize transfers
from TANF to other federal block grants
so that funds are available to meet the
annual expenditure needs as appropriated.
Transfers may be authorized prior to the
expenditure year with the agreement of the
receiving entity. Transferred funds must be
expended in the year for which the funds were
appropriated unless appropriation language
permits otherwise. In accelerating transfer
authorizations, the commissioner must aim to
preserve the future potential transfer capacity
from TANF to other block grants.
[TANF MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.]
(a) In order to meet the basic maintenance
of effort (MOE) requirements of the TANF
block grant specified under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 263.1, the
commissioner may only report nonfederal
money expended for allowable activities
listed in the following clauses as TANF/MOE
expenditures:
(1) MFIP cash, diversionary work program,
and food assistance benefits under Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 256J;
(2) the child care assistance programs under
Minnesota Statutes, sections 119B.03 and
41ST DAY]                          SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009   3015

119B.05, and county child care administrative
costs under Minnesota Statutes, section
119B.15;
(3) state and county MFIP administrative
costs under Minnesota Statutes, chapters 256J
and 256K;
(4) state, county, and tribal MFIP employment
services under Minnesota Statutes, chapters
256J and 256K;
(5) expenditures made on behalf of noncitizen
MFIP recipients who qualify for the
medical assistance without federal financial
participation program under Minnesota
Statutes, section 256B.06, subdivision 4,
paragraphs (d), (e), and (j); and
(6) qualifying working family credit
expenditures under Minnesota Statutes,
section 290.0671.
(b) The commissioner shall ensure that
sufficient qualified nonfederal expenditures
are made each year to meet the state's
TANF/MOE requirements. For the activities
listed in paragraph (a), clauses (2) to
(6), the commissioner may only report
expenditures that are excluded from the
definition of assistance under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 260.31.
(c) By August 31 of each year, the
commissioner shall make a preliminary
calculation to determine the likelihood that
the state will meet its annual federal work
participation requirement under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 45, sections 261.21
and 261.23, after adjustment for any caseload
reduction credit under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 261.41. If the
commissioner determines that the state will
meet its federal work participation rate for the
federal fiscal year ending that September, the
commissioner may reduce the expenditure
under paragraph (a), clause (1), to the extent
allowed under Code of Federal Regulations,
title 45, section 263.1(a)(2).
3016                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [41ST DAY

(d) For fiscal years beginning with state
fiscal year 2003, the commissioner shall
assure that the maintenance of effort used
by the commissioner of finance for the
February and November forecasts required
under Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.103,
contains expenditures under paragraph (a),
clause (1), equal to at least 25 percent of
the total required under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 263.1.
(e) If nonfederal expenditures for the
programs and purposes listed in paragraph
(a) are insufficient to meet the state's
TANF/MOE requirements, the commissioner
shall recommend additional allowable
sources of nonfederal expenditures to the
legislature, if the legislature is or will be in
session to take action to specify additional
sources of nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE before a federal penalty is
imposed. The commissioner shall otherwise
provide notice to the legislative commission
on planning and fiscal policy under paragraph
(g).
(f) If the commissioner uses authority
granted under section 11, or similar authority
granted by a subsequent legislature, to meet
the state's TANF/MOE requirement in a
reporting period, the commissioner shall
inform the chairs of the appropriate legislative
committees about all transfers made under
that authority for this purpose.
(g) If the commissioner determines that
nonfederal expenditures under paragraph
(a) are insufficient to meet TANF/MOE
expenditure requirements, and if the
legislature is not or will not be in session
to take timely action to avoid a federal
penalty, the commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures from other allowable
sources as TANF/MOE expenditures
after the requirements of this paragraph
are met. The commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures in addition to those
specified under paragraph (a) as nonfederal
41ST DAY]                           SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 2009   3017

TANF/MOE expenditures, but only ten
days after the commissioner of finance
has first submitted the commissioner's
recommendations for additional allowable
sources     of    nonfederal    TANF/MOE
expenditures to the members of the legislative
commission on planning and fiscal policy for
their review.
(h) The commissioner of finance shall not
incorporate any changes in federal TANF
expenditures or nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE that may result from reporting
additional allowable sources of nonfederal
TANF/MOE expenditures under the interim
procedures in paragraph (g) into the February
or November forecasts required under
Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.103, unless
the commissioner of finance has approved
the additional sources of expenditures under
paragraph (g).
(i) Minnesota Statutes, section 256.011,
subdivision 3, which requires that federal
grants or aids secured or obtained under that
subdivision be used to reduce any direct
appropriations provided by law, do not apply
if the grants or aids are federal TANF funds.
(j) Notwithstanding section 14, paragraph (a),
clauses (1) to (6), and paragraphs (b) to (j)
expire June 30, 2007.
