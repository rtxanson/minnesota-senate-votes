   H.F. No. 2859: A bill for an act relating to human services; modifying a nursing facility rate
provision; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.431, subdivision 35.
   Senator Sheran moved to amend H.F. No. 2859 as follows:
   Page 1, after line 14, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
   (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
11708                                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                               [105TH DAY

9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
      (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. T       ­h­­e­­p­­ro

A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
105TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, MAY 14, 2010                                      11709

expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods for contract
years starting in 2012, the commissioner must consider the methods used to determine county
allocations for home and community-based program participants. If necessary to reduce MnDHO
rates to comply with the provision regarding MnDHO costs for home and community-based
services, the commissioner shall achieve the reduction by maintaining the base rate for contract
years 2010 and 2011 for services provided under the community alternatives for disabled
individuals waiver at the same level as for contract year 2009. The commissioner may apply other
reductions to MnDHO rates to implement decreases in provider payment rates required by state
law. In developing program specifications for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner
shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph
(d), including consultation on whether and how to include home and community-based waiver
programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the
house of representatives and senate committees with jurisdiction over health and human services
policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Community service development reduction. The appropriation in Laws 2009,
chapter 79, article 13, section 3, subdivision 8, paragraph (a), for community service development
grants, as amended by Laws 2009, chapter 173, article 2, section 1, subdivision 8, paragraph (a), is
reduced by $154,000 in fiscal year 2011. The appropriation base is reduced by $139,000 for fiscal
year 2012 and $0 for fiscal year 2013. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, this provision
expires June 30, 2012.
    Subd. 2. Health care administration; PACE implementation funding. For fiscal year 2011,
$145,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of human services to complete
the actuarial and administrative work necessary to begin the operation of PACE under Minnesota
Statutes, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, paragraph (e). Base level funding for this activity shall
be $130,000 in fiscal year 2012 and $0 in fiscal year 2013.
    Subd. 3. Continuing care management; PACE implementation funding. For fiscal year
2011, $111,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of human services to
complete the actuarial and administrative work necessary to begin the operation of PACE under
Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, paragraph (e). Base level funding for this
activity shall be $101,000 in fiscal year 2012 and $0 in fiscal year 2013. For fiscal year 2013
and beyond, the commissioner must work with stakeholders to develop financing mechanisms to
complete the actuarial and administrative costs of PACE. The commissioner shall inform the chairs
and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over health care
funding by January 15, 2011, on progress to develop financing mechanisms."

legislation authorizing the plate, including but not limited to a bill or amendment, is introduced or
presented to the legislature; and
   (2) "proximate special plate" means a special plate (i) authorized under section 168.12,
subdivisions 2b and 2e; or 168.129; or (ii) authorized in law on or after August 1, 2010.
    Subd. 1a. Establishment of plate. The commissioner may only establish a special plate as
authorized under this chapter. This requirement does not apply to alternative or additional designs
for a special plate.
   Subd. 2. Submissions to commissioner. (a) A person, legal entity, or other requester, however
organized, that plans to seek legislation establishing a new special plate, or is a proponent of a new
special plate, shall submit the following information and fee to the commissioner:
    (1) The requester shall submit a request for the special plate being sought, describing the
p­
­ro
  ­p­o
     ­­
      s­
       ed
        ­ special plate in general terms, the purpose of the plate, and the proposed fee or minimum
contribution required for the plate.
    (2) The requester shall submit the results of a scientific sample survey of Minnesota motor
vehicle owners that indicates that at least 10,000 motor vehicle owners intend to purchase the
proposed plate with the proposed fee or minimum contribution. The requester's plan to undertake
the survey must be reported to the commissioner before the survey is undertaken. The survey must
be performed independently of the requester by another person or legal entity, however organized,
that conducts similar sample surveys in the normal course of business.
    (3) The requester shall submit an application fee of $20,000, to cover the cost of reviewing the
application for a new plate and developing the new special plate if authorized by law. State funds
may not be used to pay the application fee. This requirement does not apply if legislation or a bill
introduced to the legislature proposing the new special plate contains a mechanism by which all
costs incurred by the commissioner for development and implementation of the plate are covered,
provided that the application fee subsequently does apply if such a mechanism is not enacted in the
law authorizing the new special plate.
   (4) The requester shall submit a marketing strategy that contains (i) short-term and long-term
marketing plans for the requested plate, and (ii) a financial analysis showing the anticipated revenues
and the planned expenditures of any fee or contribution derived from the requested plate.
    (b) The requester shall submit the information required under paragraph (a) to the commissioner
at least 120 days before the convening of the next regular legislative session at which the requester

will submit the proposal.
   Subd. 2a. Information for legislature. (a) Within 15 days of the introduction of a bill proposing
a new special plate, the commissioner shall submit a briefing to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives and senate committees to which the bill was referred. At a
minimum, the briefing must:
    (1) summarize the requirements for a special plate under this section; and
    (2) identify which of the requirements have been met for the proposed special plate.
    (b) If a proposed special plate is a topic of discussion at a legislative committee hearing, the
commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to provide testimony. The testimony must include
the information required in the briefing under paragraph (a).
    (c) Notwithstanding section 3.195, the commissioner may submit the briefing under paragraph
(a) by submitting an electronic version rather than a printed version.
    Subd. 3. Design; redesign. (a) If the proposed ­ n­
                                                      ew­ special plate sought by the requester is
approved by law, the requester shall submit the proposed design for the plate to the commissioner
as soon as practicable, but not later than 120 days after the effective date of the law authorizing
issuance of the plate. The commissioner is responsible for selecting the final design for the special
plate.
    (b) The requester that originally requested a new special plate subsequently approved by law
may not submit a new design for the plate within the five years following the date of first issuance
of the plate unless the inventory of those plates has been exhausted. The requester may deplete the
remaining inventory of the plates by reimbursing the commissioner for the cost of the plates.
    Subd. 4. Refund of fee. If the special plate requested is not authorized in the legislative session
at which authorization was sought, the commissioner shall, if applicable, refund $17,500 of the
application fee to the requester.
    Subd. 5. Discontinuance of plate. (a) The commissioner shall discontinue the issuance or
renewal of any proximate special plate ­        au
