   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Estates subject to claims. If a person receives any medical assistance hereunder, on
the person's death, if single, or on the death of the survivor of a married couple, either or both of
whom received medical assistance, or as otherwise provided for in this section, the total amount
paid for medical assistance rendered for the person and spouse shall be filed as a claim against the
estate of the person or the estate of the surviving spouse in the court having jurisdiction to probate
the estate or to issue a decree of descent according to sections 525.31 to 525.313.
    A claim shall be filed if medical assistance was rendered for either or both persons under one of
the following circumstances:
   (a) the person was over 55 years of age, and received services under this chapter;
     (b) the person resided in a medical institution for six months or longer, received services under
this chapter, and, at the time of institutionalization or application for medical assistance, whichever
is later, the person could not have reasonably been expected to be discharged and returned home, as
certified in writing by the person's treating physician. For purposes of this section only, a "medical
institution" means a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, intermediate care facility for
persons with developmental disabilities, nursing facility, or inpatient hospital; or
   (c) the person received general assistance medical care services under chapter 256D.
    The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent for the purpose of
section 524.3-805. Any statute of limitations that purports to limit any county agency or the state
agency, or both, to recover for medical assistance granted hereunder shall not apply to any claim
made hereunder for reimbursement for any medical assistance granted hereunder. Notice of the
claim shall be given to all heirs and devisees of the decedent, and to other persons with an ownership
interest in the real property owned by the decedent at the time of the decedent's death, whose identity
can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The notice must include procedures and instructions
for making an application for a hardship waiver under subdivision 5; time frames for submitting an
application and determination; and information regarding appeal rights and procedures. Counties
are entitled to one-half of the nonfederal share of medical assistance collections from estates that
are directly attributable to county effort. Counties are entitled to ten percent of the collections for
alternative care directly attributable to county effort.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Undue hardship. (a) Any person entitled to notice in subdivision 1a has a right to apply
for waiver of the claim based upon undue hardship. Any claim pursuant to this section may be fully
or partially waived because of undue hardship. Undue hardship does not include action taken by the
decedent which divested or diverted assets in order to avoid estate recovery. Any waiver of a claim
must benefit the person claiming undue hardship. The commissioner shall have authority to hear
claimant appeals, pursuant to section 256.045, when an application for a hardship waiver is denied
in whole or part.
   (b) This paragraph applies to a claim against the decedent's real property if an individual other
than the recipient's spouse had an ownership interest in the property at the time of the decedent's
death and actually and continuously occupied the real property as the individual's dwelling place

for at least 180 days before the date the decedent died. If the real property is classified as homestead
property for property tax purposes under section 273.124, no claim may be made until the individual
no longer resides in the property or until the property is sold or transferred. The amount of the
homestead not subject to adjustment or recovery under this paragraph is limited to the area and
value provided under section 510.02."
   Amend the title numbers accordingly
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.

    (j) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the sponsor of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the sponsor then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school shall not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.
    (k) A new charter school must not open in a newly consolidated district under section 123A.48
or in a district dissolved under section 123A.46 for at least 36 months after the date of consolidation
or dissolution, except under subdivision 5 in this section or unless the school board of the school
district in which the charter school would be located gives the sponsor written approval to do so.
    (l) A new charter school must not open within a one-mile radius of a public school that has
closed under section 123B.51 for at least 36 months after the date the school closed unless the
commissioner determines that the new charter school applicant does not intend to reestablish the
closed public school as a charter school, except under subdivision 5 in this section or unless the
school board of the school district in which the charter school would be located gives the sponsor
written approval to do so.
     (m) A sponsor may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from paragraph (k) or paragraph
(l). The commissioner must use the criteria in this section to approve or deny the waiver within 45
business days. The commissioner's decision is final.

    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict
exists when:
     (1) the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
     (2) the immediate family of the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
     (3) the partner of the board member, employee, officer, or agent; or
    (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3), has
a financial or other interest in the entity with which the charter school is contracting. A violation of
this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the sponsor who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that sponsor.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.

    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.11, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Building lease aid. (a) When a charter school finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes and it determines that the total operating
capital revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply
to the commissioner for building lease aid for this purpose. The commissioner must review and
either approve or deny a lease aid application using the following criteria:
    (1) the reasonableness of the price based on current market values;
    (2) the extent to which the lease conforms to applicable state laws and rules; and
    (3) the appropriateness of the proposed lease in the context of the space needs and financial
circumstances of the charter school.
A charter school must not use the building lease aid it receives for custodial, maintenance service,
utility, or other operating costs.
    (b) For a charter school without a separate affiliated nonprofit building corporation, the amount
of building lease aid per pupil unit served for a charter school for any year shall not exceed the lesser
of:
    ­
    (­
     a­
      ) (1) 90 percent of the approved cost; or
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (2) the product of the pupil units served for the current school year times the greater of:
    (i) the charter school's building lease aid per pupil unit served for fiscal year 2003, excluding
the adjustment under Laws 2002, chapter 392, article 6, section 4,  ­; or
    (ii) $1,200.
    (c) For charter schools with a separate affiliated nonprofit building corporation under section
124D.10, subdivision 17a, the amount of building lease aid per pupil unit served for a charter school
for any year shall not exceed the lesser of:
    (1) 90 percent of the approved cost; or
    (2) the product of the pupil units served for the current school year times the greater of:
    (i) the charter school's building lease aid per pupil unit served for fiscal year 2003, excluding
the adjustment under Laws 2002, chapter 392, article 6, section 4; or
    (ii) $1,200.

estimated state aid entitlements. The charter school board of directors and sponsor must provide
the commissioner with a closure plan under chapter 308A or 317A, and financial information that
details the school's liabilities and assets. After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an
audit of pupil counts, and documentation of lease expenditures, and monitoring special education
expenditures, the commissioner may release cash withheld and may continue regular payments
up to the current year payment percentages if further amounts are due. If, based on audits and
monitoring, the school received state aid in excess of the amount due, the commissioner shall retain
cash withheld sufficient to eliminate the aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations

of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If a charter school, within the timeline under section 471.425, fails to pay a school district,
intermediate school district, education cooperative, or the state after receiving an undisputed invoice
for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid sufficient to satisfy
the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the school district, intermediate school district,
or service cooperative. A school district, intermediate school district, education cooperative, or
a representative of the state shall notify the commissioner when a charter school fails to pay an
undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it received the original invoice.

PROGRAMS.
   (a) At the beginning of each school year, each school district shall have in effect, for each child
with a disability, an individualized education program.
   (b) As defined in this section, every district must ensure the following:
    (1) all students with disabilities are provided the special instruction and services which are
appropriate to their needs. Where the individual education plan team has determined appropriate
goals and objectives based on the student's needs, including the extent to which the student can
be included in the least restrictive environment, and where there are essentially equivalent and
effective instruction, related services, or assistive technology devices available to meet the student's
needs, cost to the district may be among the factors considered by the team in choosing how to
provide the appropriate services, instruction, or devices that are to be made part of the student's
individual education plan. The individual education plan team shall consider and may authorize
services covered by medical assistance according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 26. The
student's needs and the special education instruction and services to be provided must be agreed
upon through the development of an individual education plan. The plan must address the student's
need to develop skills to live and work as independently as possible within the community. The
individual education plan team must consider positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and
supports that address behavior for children with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. B ­y­ During grade 9 ­  o­r­

for transition from secondary services to postsecondary education and training, employment,
community participation, recreation, and leisure and home living. In developing the plan, districts
must inform parents of the full range of transitional goals and related services that should be
considered. The plan must include a statement of the needed transition services, including a
statement of the interagency responsibilities or linkages or both before secondary services are
concluded;
   (2) children with a disability under age five and their families are provided special instruction
and services appropriate to the child's level of functioning and needs;

    (3) children with a disability and their parents or guardians are guaranteed procedural safeguards
and the right to participate in decisions involving identification, assessment including assistive
technology assessment, and educational placement of children with a disability;
    (4) eligibility and needs of children with a disability are determined by an initial assessment
or reassessment, which may be completed using existing data under United States Code, title 20,
section 33, et seq.;
    (5) to the maximum extent appropriate, children with a disability, including those in public or
private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and
that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with a disability from the
regular educational environment occurs only when and to the extent that the nature or severity of
the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services cannot
be achieved satisfactorily;
    (6) in accordance with recognized professional standards, testing and evaluation materials, and
procedures used for the purposes of classification and placement of children with a disability are
selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory; and
   (7) the rights of the child are protected when the parents or guardians are not known or not
available, or the child is a ward of the state.

   (b
    ­­) (c) For paraprofessionals employed to work in programs for students with disabilities, the
school board in each district shall ensure that:
    (1) before or immediately upon employment, each paraprofessional develops sufficient
knowledge and skills in emergency procedures, building orientation, roles and responsibilities,
confidentiality, vulnerability, and reportability, among other things, to begin meeting the needs of
the students with whom the paraprofessional works;
    (2) annual training opportunities are available to enable the paraprofessional to continue
to further develop the knowledge and skills that are specific to the students with whom the
paraprofessional works, including understanding disabilities, following lesson plans, and
implementing follow-up instructional procedures and activities; and
    (3) a districtwide process obligates each paraprofessional to work under the ongoing direction
of a licensed teacher and, where appropriate and possible, the supervision of a school nurse.

    Subd. 5. Initial action; parent consent. (a) The district must not proceed with the initial
evaluation of a child, the initial placement of a child in a special education program, or the initial
provision of special education services for a child without the prior written consent of the child's
parent. A district may not override the written refusal of a parent to consent to an initial evaluation
or reevaluation.
   (b) A parent, after consulting with health care, education, or other professional providers, may
agree or disagree to provide the parent's child with sympathomimetic medications unless section
144.344 applies.
    Subd. 6. Dispute resolution processes; generally. Parties are encouraged to resolve disputes
over the identification, evaluation, educational placement, manifestation determination, interim
alternative educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child
with a disability through conciliation, mediation, facilitated team meetings, or other alternative
process. All dispute resolution options are voluntary on the part of the parent and must not be used
to deny or delay the right to a due process hearing. All dispute resolution processes under this
section are provided at no cost to the parent.
    Subd. 7. Conciliation conference. A parent must have an opportunity to meet with appropriate
district staff in at least one conciliation conference if the parent objects to any proposal of which the
parent receives notice under subdivision 2    ­ 3a. If the parent refuses district efforts to conciliate the

dispute, the conciliation requirement is satisfied. Following a conciliation conference, the district
must prepare and provide to the parent a conciliation conference memorandum that describes
the district's final proposed offer of service. This memorandum is admissible in evidence in any
subsequent proceeding.
    Subd. 8. Voluntary dispute resolution options. In addition to offering at least one conciliation
conference, a district must inform a parent of other dispute resolution processes, including at least
mediation and facilitated team meetings. The fact that an alternative dispute resolution process
was used is admissible in evidence at any subsequent proceeding. State-provided mediators and
team meeting facilitators shall not be subpoenaed to testify at a due process hearing or civil action
under federal special education law nor are any records of mediators or state-provided team meeting
facilitators accessible to the parties.
    Subd. 9. Mediation. Mediation is a dispute resolution process that involves a neutral party
provided by the state to assist a parent and a district in resolving disputes over the identification,
evaluation, educational placement, manifestation determination, interim alternative educational
placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability. A
mediation process is available as an informal alternative to a due process hearing but must not be
used to deny or postpone the opportunity of a parent or district to obtain a due process hearing.
Mediation is voluntary for all parties. All mediation discussions are confidential and inadmissible
in evidence in any subsequent proceeding, unless the:
      (1) parties expressly agree otherwise;
      (2) evidence is otherwise available; or
      (3) evidence is offered to prove bias or prejudice of a witness.

a list of qualified hearing officers who are not employees of or otherwise under contract with the
department or the school district except when under contract with the department as a hearing officer,
and who do not have a personal or professional interest that conflicts with their objectivity when
serving as hearing officers in hearings under this section. The list shall include a statement of the
qualifications of each person listed. A hearing officer must know and understand state and federal
special education laws, rules, and regulations, and legal interpretations by federal and state courts.
A hearing officer also must have the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings and render and write
decisions according to appropriate, standard legal practice. Upon receipt of a written request for a
hearing, the commissioner shall appoint a hearing officer from the list. The hearing officer must:
    (1) be knowledgeable and impartial;
   (2) have no personal interest in or specific involvement with the student who is a party to the
hearing;
    (3) not have been employed as an administrator by the district that is a party to the hearing;
    (4) not have been involved in selecting the district administrator who is a party to the hearing;
   (5) have no personal, economic, or professional interest in the outcome of the hearing other than
properly administering federal and state laws, rules, and policies;
   (6) have no substantial involvement in developing state or local policies or procedures
challenged in the hearing;
    (7) not be a current employee or board member of a Minnesota public school district, education
district, intermediate unit or regional education agency, or the department if the department is the
service provider; and
    (8) not be a current employee or board member of a disability advocacy organization or group.

(a) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a due process hearing regarding a
proposal or refusal to initiate or change that child's evaluation, individualized education program,
or educational placement, or to provide a free appropriate public education.
    (b) The parent shall include in the hearing request the name of the child, the address of the child's
residence, the name of the school the child attends, a description of the child's problem relating to
the proposed or refused initiation or change, including facts relating to the problem, and a proposed
resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the parents at the time.
     (c) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a hearing under United States Code,
title 20, section 1415, paragraph (k).
    (d) A parent or school district filing a request for a hearing under this subdivision must provide
the request to the other party and a copy of the request to the department. Upon receiving a request
for a hearing, the department shall give to the child's parent a copy of the procedural safeguards
notice available to a parent under federal regulations.
    (e) (1) If the parent of a child with a disability files a written request for a hearing, and the
school district has not previously sent a written notice to the parent under subdivision 3, regarding
the subject matter of the hearing request, the school district shall, within ten days of receiving the
hearing request, send to the child's parent a written explanation of why the school district proposed
or refused to take the action raised in the hearing request, a description of other options that the
individualized education program team considered and the reason why those options were rejected,
a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report that the school district used
as the basis for the proposed or refused action, and a description of the factors that are relevant to
the school district's proposal or refusal. A response by a school district under this subdivision does
not preclude the school district from asserting that the parent's request for a hearing is insufficient
under clause (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) A hearing may not occur until the party requesting the hearing files a request that meets the
requirements of paragraph (b). The request under paragraph (b) is considered sufficient unless the
party receiving the request notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing within 15 days of
receiving the request that the receiving party believes the request does not meet the requirements of
paragraph (b). Within five days of receiving a notice under this subdivision, the hearing officer shall
determine whether the request meets the requirements under paragraph (b) and notify the parties.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (e), clause (1), the party receiving a request for a hearing
shall send to the party requesting the hearing a written response that addresses the issues raised in
the hearing request within ten days of receiving the request.

telephone. The hearing officer must create a written verbatim record of the prehearing conference
which is available to either party upon request. At the prehearing conference, the hearing officer
must:
   (1) identify the questions that must be answered to resolve the dispute and eliminate claims and
complaints that are without merit;
      (2) set a scheduling order for the hearing and additional prehearing activities;
    (3) determine if the hearing can be disposed of without an evidentiary hearing and, if so, establish
the schedule and procedure for doing so; and
   (4) establish the management, control, and location of the hearing to ensure its fair, efficient,
and effective disposition.

    Subd. 17. Admissible evidence. The hearing officer may admit all evidence that possesses
probative value, including hearsay, if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable, prudent

effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law and exclude evidence that is incompetent,
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious.

hearing to the time sufficient for each party to present its case.
    (b) A hearing officer must establish and maintain control and manage the hearing. This authority
includes, but is not limited to:
   (1) requiring attorneys representing parties at the hearing, after notice and an opportunity to be
heard, to pay court reporting and hearing officer costs, or fines payable to the state, for failing to: (i)
obey scheduling or prehearing orders, (ii) appear, (iii) be prepared, or (iv) participate in the hearing
process in good faith;
      (2) administering oaths and affirmations;
      (3) issuing subpoenas;
    (4) determining the responsible and providing districts and joining those districts, if not already
notified, in the proceedings;
    (5) making decisions involving identification, evaluation, educational placement, manifestation
determination, interim alternative educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate
public education to a child with a disability; ­

meeting must occur within seven days of receiving the request for an expedited due process hearing
unless the parent and the school district agree in writing either to waive the resolution meeting or use
the mediation process. The expedited due process hearing may proceed unless the matter has been
resolved to the satisfaction of both parties within 15 days of receiving the expedited due process
hearing request.
      Subd. 20. Hearing officer's decision; time period. (a) The hearing officer must issue a decision
within 45 calendar days of the date on which the commissioner receives the request for a due process
hearing. A hearing officer is encouraged to accelerate the time line to 30 days for a child under
the age of three whose needs change rapidly and who requires quick resolution of a dispute. A
hearing officer may not extend the time beyond the 45-day period unless requested by either party
for good cause shown on the record. E                       ­x

health care event, the facility must conduct a root cause analysis of the event. In conducting the
root cause analysis, the facility must consider as one of the factors staffing levels and the impact
of staffing levels on the event. Following the analysis, the facility must: (1) implement a corrective
action plan to implement the findings of the analysis or (2) report to the commissioner any reasons
for not taking corrective action. If the root cause analysis and the implementation of a corrective
action plan are complete at the time an event must be reported, the findings of the analysis and the
corrective action plan must be included in the report of the event. The findings of the root cause
analysis and a copy of the corrective action plan must otherwise be filed with the commissioner

not reasonably explained" under section 626.556 or 626.557 and are excluded from the reporting
requirements of sections 626.556 and 626.557, provided the facility makes a determination within
24 hours of the discovery of the event that this section is applicable and the facility files the reports
required under this section in a timely fashion.

must inform persons who are mandated reporters under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or
626.5572, subdivision 16, of that determination. A mandated reporter otherwise required to report

duty to report an event that the facility determines under paragraph (a) to be reportable under
subdivisions 2 to 6.
   (c) The protections and immunities applicable to voluntary reports under sections 626.556 and
626.557 are not affected by this section.

rule to the contrary, neither a lead agency under section 626.556, subdivision 3c, or 626.5572,
subdivision 13, the commissioner of health, nor the director of the Office of Health Facility
Complaints is required to conduct an investigation of or obtain or create investigative data or
reports regarding an event described in subdivisions 2 to 6. If the facility satisfies the requirements
described in paragraph (a), the review or investigation shall be conducted and data or reports shall
be obtained or created only under sections 144.706 to 144.7069, except as permitted or required
under sections 144.50 to 144.564, or as necessary to carry out the state's certification responsibility
under the provisions of sections 1864 and 1867 of the Social Security Act. If a licensed health
care provider reports to the facility an event required to be reported under subdivisions 2 to 6,
in a timely manner, the provider's licensing board is not required to conduct an investigation of
or obtain or create investigative data or reports regarding the individual reporting of the events
described in subdivisions 2 to 6.

individuals, confidential data on individuals, as defined in section 13.02:
   (1) reports provided to the commissioner under sections 147.155, 147A.155, 148.267, 151.301,

findings, and plans described in clause (2).

    (a) The commissioner of health shall consult with representatives from the Minnesota Nurses
Association, the Minnesota Hospital Association, and other stakeholders to further define staffing
levels for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 144.7065, subdivision 8, and to develop questions
related to staffing for inclusion in the root cause analysis tool required under that subdivision.
   (b) The Minnesota Nurses Association and the Minnesota Hospital Association shall develop

Nurses Association on Minnesota Hospital Association work groups and committees dealing with
adverse health care events and corrective action plans under Minnesota Statutes, section 144.7065."

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.70, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Commissioner approval. In determining whether to give a school facility
a positive, negative, or unfavorable review and comment, the commissioner must evaluate the
proposals for facilities using the information provided under section 123B.71, subdivision 9.
The commissioner may evaluate the proposals using the most recent "Guide for Planning School
Construction in Minnesota" prepared by the Department of Education, but must not issue a negative
or unfavorable review and comment under this section for a school facility based on the acreage of
the proposed school site. The commissioner must evaluate the energy and environmental impact of
any new school facility. If a school is proposed for a new site, the commissioner must examine the
energy costs associated with that facility, including the change in pupil transportation costs, and
the costs of establishing new infrastructure, including roads, sidewalks, and utility lines.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for review and comments issued after July 1,
2009.
   Sec. 2. [394.2311] LIMITED DENSITIES IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS.
    (a) Except as provided in section 3, a county may not allow densities greater than that provided
in this section. This section does not apply to unincorporated areas within a city's designated growth
boundary established under section 462.357, areas that are subdivided and for which there is a
recorded plat as of August 1, 2011, areas governed by shoreland regulations, or parcels classified as
noncommercial seasonal residential recreational property for property tax purposes.
   (b) Unincorporated areas with no more than one residential unit per 40 acres as of August 1,
2009, must not be developed with residential densities greater than one unit per 40 acres. If the

unincorporated area has a residential density greater than one residential unit per 40 acres as of
August 1, 2009, the density must not be increased. A county may enact a new or enforce an existing
cluster development ordinance provided that the ordinance:
   (1) limits the maximum number of dwelling units to no more than 150 percent of the number
otherwise permitted in the zoning district;
   (2) limits lot sizes to no larger than two acres; and
    (3) includes cluster development site standards designed to avoid development on, fragmentation
of, or interference with prime farmland soils, tillable farmland, large tracks of land in agricultural
use, woodlands, and other significant stands of vegetation.
    (c) Except for unincorporated areas within a city's designated growth boundary, or areas that
are subdivided and for which there is a recorded plat as of August 1, 2011, commercial and
industrial uses must not be developed except for those uses, as determined by the county in which
the proposed development is located, that are appropriate for rural settings such as those connected
with agricultural, forestry, mining, or energy production industries or those uses that are provided
for the convenience of the traveling public such as truck stops, gas stations, convenience stores,
restaurants, or those that are recreational in nature.
  Sec. 3. [394.2312] MODIFICATION TO LIMITED DENSITIES IN UNINCORPORATED
AREAS.
   A county that has adopted a comprehensive plan in compliance with section 394.23, may allow
densities greater than those provided for in section 2, if the development does not occur within two
miles of a municipality or within a growth area established under section 462.357. The development
must conform to the following conditions:
   (1) there must be a developed and implemented storm water management plan for the
development; and
    (2) wastewater needs for the site must be handled by a wastewater collection and treatment
system that complies with section 115.55 and an administrative rule or county ordinance adopted
under section 115.55.
Before allowing development under this subdivision the county must update its comprehensive plan
with an evaluation of the potential public infrastructure and operational costs of serving the proposed
development for a period of 25 years, and an analysis of the transportation-related carbon emissions,
using commonly accepted methodology, of the development.
   Sec. 4. [414.023] INCORPORATIONS PROHIBITED AFTER JUNE 1, 2009.
   The chief administrative law judge must not order any municipal incorporations after June 1,
2009.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.352, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1a. City. "City" means a statutory or home rule charter city.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.357, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

      Subdivision 1. Authority for zoning. For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare, a municipality may by ordinance regulate on the earth's surface, in
the air space above the surface, and in subsurface areas, the location, height, width, bulk, type of
foundation, number of stories, size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot which may
be occupied, the size of yards and other open spaces, the density and distribution of population, the
uses of buildings and structures for trade, industry, residence, recreation, public activities, or other
purposes, and the uses of land for trade, industry, residence, recreation, agriculture, forestry, soil
conservation, water supply conservation, conservation of shorelands, as defined in sections 103F.201
to 103F.221, access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems as defined in section 216C.06, flood
control or other purposes, and may establish standards and procedures regulating such uses. To
accomplish these purposes, official controls may include provision for purchase of development
rights by the governing body in the form of conservation easements under chapter 84C in areas where
the governing body considers preservation desirable and the transfer of development rights from
those areas to areas the governing body considers more appropriate for development. No regulation
may prohibit earth sheltered construction as defined in section 216C.06, subdivision 14, relocated
residential buildings, or manufactured homes built in conformance with sections 327.31 to 327.35
that comply with all other zoning ordinances promulgated pursuant to this section. The regulations
may divide the surface, above surface, and subsurface areas of the municipality into districts or
zones of suitable numbers, shape, and area. The regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind
of buildings, structures, or land and for each class or kind of use throughout such district, but the
regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts. The ordinance embodying these
regulations shall be known as the zoning ordinance and shall consist of text and maps. A                                                                    ­­­ c­t

      Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.357, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1i. Limited densities in unincorporated areas. (a) This subdivision does not apply to
unincorporated areas within a city's designated growth boundary, areas that are subdivided and
for which there is a recorded plat as of August 1, 2011, areas governed by shoreland regulations,
or parcels classified as noncommercial seasonal residential recreational property for property tax
purposes.
    (b) Unincorporated areas with no more than one residential unit per 40 acres as of August 1,
2011, must not be developed with residential densities greater than one unit per 40 acres. If the
unincorporated area has a residential density greater than one residential unit per 40 acres as of
August 1, 2011, the density must not be increased. A county may enact a new or enforce an existing
cluster development ordinance provided that the ordinance:
   (1) limits the maximum number of dwelling units to no more than 150 percent of the number
otherwise permitted in the zoning district;
      (2) limits lot sizes to no larger than two acres; and
26TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 2009                                       1067

    (3) includes cluster development site standards designed to avoid development on, fragmentation
of, or interference with prime farmland soils, tillable farmland, large tracks of land in agricultural
use, woodlands, and other significant stands of vegetation.
    (c) Except for unincorporated areas within a city's designated growth boundary, or areas that
are subdivided and for which there is a recorded plat as of August 1, 2011, commercial and
industrial uses must not be developed except for those uses, as determined by the county in which
the proposed development is located, that are appropriate for rural settings such as those connected
with agricultural, forestry, mining, or energy production industries or those uses that are provided
for the convenience of the traveling public such as truck stops, gas stations, convenience stores,
restaurants, or those that are recreational in nature.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.357, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1j. Status of unincorporated area before establishment of growth area. Before,
or in the absence of, the establishment of a growth area and adoption of land use controls
under subdivision 10, the area outside of a city for two miles in any direction is deemed to be
the city's preliminary growth area. Except for areas that are subdivided and for which there
is a recorded plat as of February 1, 2009, areas governed by shoreland regulations, parcels
classified as noncommercial seasonal residential recreational property for property tax purposes, or
development that is adjacent to a city and that would be served by city sewer and water at the time
of development, the residential density of the preliminary growth area must not exceed the limits
of this subdivision. Areas within the preliminary growth area with no more than one residential
unit per 40 acres as of August 1, 2009, must not be developed with residential densities greater
than one unit per 40 acres. If the area within the preliminary growth area has a residential density
greater than one unit per 40 acres as of August 1, 2009, the density must not be increased.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.357, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10. City growth areas. (a) Upon request of a city to a township, a joint powers
board consisting of three city and three township residents shall be appointed for the purpose of
establishing and administering a city growth area. The members of the joint powers board must
be residents of the jurisdictions they represent and shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure
of the respective governing bodies. The joint powers board may create a growth area for the city
after determining that: (1) population growth demands more housing than can be developed in
the space available within the city, or growth in commercial or industrial use requires more space
than available within the city, (2) planning of city services is necessary to facilitate the growth,
and (3) the city has the capacity and willingness to extend city services such as sewer and water
throughout the growth area. An area must not be included in the growth area if the city is not
willing or is unable to extend sewer or water services. An area is appropriate to be included in
a city's growth area to the extent that future development within the growth area will maximize
existing transportation, water, sewer, and other municipal infrastructure, while avoiding to the
extent practicable the development of class A agricultural land.
    (b) Before designating the growth area, the joint powers board must hold a hearing to present
to the public its proposed findings for a designated growth area. Notice of the hearing must be
published in the city and in the proposed designated growth area. Members of the public must be
given a reasonable opportunity to present their comments. The joint powers board also must provide
the proposed findings and designated growth area to the county planning authority of each county
1068                                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                               [26TH DAY

affected. A county has 90 days to approve or reject the growth area plan proposed by the joint powers
board. If the county rejects the growth area, the county must submit an alternative growth area plan
to the joint powers board within 90 days of the receipt of the original plan from the joint powers
board. If the county takes no action within the 90-day period the growth area is deemed approved
as submitted to the county.
    (c) If more than one city claims the same unincorporated area for its growth area, an
administrative law judge will determine in accordance with chapter 414 and this section which
city is best positioned to serve the area weighing factors that include existing development and
population growth patterns; existing transportation infrastructure; impact on vehicle miles traveled
from area to regional amenities, schools, jobs, and governmental services; and the overall costs of
extending services to the area.
    (d) If the city's growth area includes land zoned by the county or town for agricultural use at
the time the growth area is adopted, that land continues to be subject only to the county's or town's
official controls for agricultural use. When the county or town receives a request to change the zoning
classification of that land to a nonagricultural use, and that request is approved by the appropriate
land use authority, it becomes subject to the authority of the joint powers board in paragraph (e).
    (e) Once established, the growth area shall be governed by the same joint powers board, which
established the growth area. Except as provided in paragraph (d), the joint powers board has the
exclusive authority to plan, adopt, and enforce official controls in the growth area. Planning and
development in the growth area must be at densities that are consistent with the rest of the city.
     (f) Growth areas must be reviewed by the city council at least every ten years.
   (g) As development occurs in the growth area and sewer and water service is extended to the
development, that part of the growth area may be annexed to the city by ordinance under chapter
414. Annexation by ordinance under this paragraph is not subject to the conditions for annexation
by ordinance in section 414.033, subdivision 2.
  (h) A joint powers board that has established a growth area must file its growth area plan and
maps with the Office of Administrative Hearings municipal boundary adjustments.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462.358, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Authority. To protect and promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, to
provide for the orderly, economic, and safe development of land, to preserve agricultural lands,
to promote the availability of housing affordable to persons and families of all income levels,
and to facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewage, storm drainage, schools,
parks, playgrounds, and other public services and facilities, a municipality may by ordinance adopt
subdivision regulations establishing standards, requirements, and procedures for the review and
approval or disapproval of subdivisions. The regulations may contain varied provisions respecting,
and be made applicable only to, certain classes or kinds of subdivisions. The regulations shall be
uniform for each class or kind of subdivision.

    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.174, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10c. Compact development district. "Compact development district" means a type of
tax increment financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the
authority finds by resolution that the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings or other
structures that are classified as class 3a property under section 273.13, subdivision 24; and
    (2) the planned redevelopment or development of the district, when completed, will increase
the total square footage of buildings, classified as class 3a under section 273.13, subdivision 24,
occupying the district by three times or more relative to the square footage of similar buildings
occupying the district when the resolution was approved.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after June 30, 2009.
    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.176, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1b. Duration limits; terms. (a) No tax increment shall in any event be paid to the authority
    (1) after 15 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a renewal and renovation
district,
    (2) after 20 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a soils condition district,
   (3) after eight years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for an economic
development district,
   (4) for a housing district, a compact development district, or a redevelopment district, after 25
years from the date of receipt by the authority of the first increment.
    (b) For purposes of determining a duration limit under this subdivision or subdivision 1e that
is based on the receipt of an increment, any increments from taxes payable in the year in which
the district terminates shall be paid to the authority. This paragraph does not affect a duration limit
calculated from the date of approval of the tax increment financing plan or based on the recovery of
costs or to a duration limit under subdivision 1c. This paragraph does not supersede the restrictions
on payment of delinquent taxes in subdivision 1f.
    (c) An action by the authority to waive or decline to accept an increment has no effect for
purposes of computing a duration limit based on the receipt of increment under this subdivision
or any other provision of law. The authority is deemed to have received an increment for any year
in which it waived or declined to accept an increment, regardless of whether the increment was paid
to the authority.
    (d) Receipt by a hazardous substance subdistrict of an increment as a result of a reduction in
original net tax capacity under section 469.174, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not constitute
receipt of increment by the overlying district for the purpose of calculating the duration limit under
this section.

another outside of a workplace setting.
    (f) "Off-highway vehicle" and "vehicle" do not include an off-highway vehicle that is stolen or
taken in violation of the law.
    (g) "Owner" means a person legally entitled to possession, use, and control of an off-highway
vehicle, including a lessee of an off-highway vehicle if the lease agreement has a term of 180 days
or more. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person registered as the owner of an off-highway
vehicle according to the records of the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Natural
Resources is the legal owner. For purposes of this section, if an off-highway vehicle is owned jointly
by two or more people, each owner's interest extends to the whole of the vehicle and is not subject
to apportionment.
    (h) "Prosecuting authority" means the attorney in the jurisdiction in which the designated
offense occurred, or a designee, who is responsible for prosecuting violations of a designated
offense. If a state agency initiated the forfeiture and the attorney responsible for prosecuting the
designated offense declines to pursue forfeiture, the attorney general's office, or its designee, may
initiate forfeiture under this section.
    (i) "Security interest" means a bona fide security interest perfected according to section 168A.17,
subdivision 2, based on a loan or other financing that, if an off-highway vehicle is required to be
registered under chapter 168, is listed on the vehicle's title.
    Subd. 2. Seizure. (a) An off-highway vehicle subject to forfeiture under this section may be
seized by the appropriate agency upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the
vehicle.
   (b) Property may be seized without process if:
   (1) the seizure is incident to a lawful arrest or a lawful search;
    (2) the vehicle subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in
a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this section; or
    (3) the appropriate agency has probable cause to believe that the delay occasioned by the
necessity to obtain process would result in the removal or destruction of the vehicle. If property
is seized without process under this clause, the prosecuting authority must institute a forfeiture
action under this section as soon as is reasonably possible by serving a notice of seizure and intent
to forfeit at the address of the owner as listed in the records of the Department of Public Safety or
Department of Natural Resources.
    Subd. 3. Right to possession vests immediately; custody. All right, title, and interest in an
off-highway vehicle subject to forfeiture under this section vests in the appropriate agency upon
commission of the conduct resulting in the designated offense giving rise to the forfeiture. Any
vehicle seized under this section is not subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of
the appropriate agency subject to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the
forfeiture proceedings. When an off-highway vehicle is seized under this section, the appropriate
agency may:
   (1) place the vehicle under seal;
1104                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [26TH DAY

   (2) remove the vehicle to a place designated by the agency;
   (3) place a disabling device on the vehicle; and
   (4) take other steps reasonable and necessary to secure the vehicle and prevent waste.
    Subd. 4. Bond by owner for possession. If the owner of an off-highway vehicle that has been
seized under this section seeks possession of the vehicle before the forfeiture action is determined,
the owner may, subject to the approval of the appropriate agency, give security or post bond payable
to the appropriate agency in an amount equal to the retail value of the seized vehicle. On posting
the security or bond, the seized vehicle may be returned to the owner. The forfeiture action must
proceed against the security as if it were the seized vehicle.
   Subd. 5. Evidence. Certified copies of court records and off-highway vehicle and driver's records
concerning prior incidents are admissible as substantive evidence where necessary to prove the
commission of a designated offense.
    Subd. 6. Vehicle subject to forfeiture. An off-highway vehicle is subject to forfeiture under this
section if it was used in the commission of a designated offense.
   Subd. 7. Presumptions; limitations on vehicle forfeiture. (a) An off-highway vehicle is
presumed subject to forfeiture under this section if the driver:
   (1) is convicted of the designated offense upon which the forfeiture is based; or
   (2) fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance with respect to the designated offense charged
and fails to voluntarily surrender within 48 hours after the time required for appearance.
    (b) An off-highway vehicle encumbered by a security interest perfected according to section
168A.17, subdivision 2, or subject to a lease that has a term of 180 days or more, is subject to the
interest of the secured party or lessor unless the party or lessor had knowledge of or consented to the
act upon which the forfeiture is based. However, when the proceeds of the sale of a seized vehicle do
not equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance, the appropriate agency shall remit all proceeds of
the sale to the secured party after deducting the agency's costs for the seizure, tow, storage, forfeiture,
and sale of the vehicle. If the sale of the vehicle is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner
consistent with section 336.9-610, the agency is not liable to the secured party for any amount owed
on the loan in excess of the sale proceeds. The validity and amount of a nonperfected security interest
must be established by its holder by clear and convincing evidence.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the secured party's or lessor's interest in an off-highway
vehicle is not subject to forfeiture based solely on the secured party's or lessor's knowledge of the
act or omission upon which the forfeiture is based if the secured party or lessor demonstrates by
clear and convincing evidence that the party or lessor took reasonable steps to terminate use of the
vehicle by the offender.
    (d) An off-highway vehicle is not subject to forfeiture under this section if its owner can
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the owner did not have actual or constructive
knowledge that the vehicle would be used or operated in any manner contrary to law or that the
owner took reasonable steps to prevent use of the vehicle by the offender. If the offender is a family
or household member of the owner and has three or more prior off-highway vehicle convictions,
the owner is presumed to know of any vehicle use by the offender that is contrary to law.

   Subd. 8. Administrative forfeiture procedure. (a) An off-highway vehicle used to commit a
designated offense is subject to administrative forfeiture under this subdivision.
    (b) When an off-highway vehicle is seized under subdivision 2, or within a reasonable time
after seizure, the appropriate agency shall serve the driver or operator of the vehicle with a notice
of the seizure and intent to forfeit the vehicle. Additionally, when an off-highway vehicle is seized
under subdivision 2, or within a reasonable time after that, all persons known to have an ownership,
possessory, or security interest in the vehicle must be notified of the seizure and the intent to forfeit
the vehicle. For those vehicles required to be registered under chapter 168, the notification to a
person known to have a security interest in the vehicle is required only if the vehicle is registered
under chapter 168 and the interest is listed on the vehicle's title. Notice mailed by certified mail to the
address shown in Department of Public Safety records is sufficient notice to the registered owner
of the vehicle. For off-highway vehicles not required to be registered under chapter 168, notice
mailed by certified mail to the address shown in the applicable filing or registration for the vehicle
is sufficient notice to a person known to have an ownership, possessory, or security interest in the
vehicle. Otherwise, notice may be given in the manner provided by law for service of a summons
in a civil action.
   (c) The notice must be in writing and contain:
   (1) a description of the vehicle seized;
   (2) the date of the seizure; and
    (3) notice of the right to obtain judicial review of the forfeiture and of the procedure for obtaining
that judicial review, printed in English, Hmong, and Spanish. Substantially, the following language
must appear conspicuously: "IF YOU DO NOT DEMAND JUDICIAL REVIEW EXACTLY
AS PRESCRIBED IN MINNESOTA STATUTES, SECTION 84.7741, SUBDIVISION 8, YOU
LOSE THE RIGHT TO A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF THIS FORFEITURE AND YOU
LOSE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED PROPERTY. YOU MAY
NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FILING FEE FOR THE DEMAND IF DETERMINED YOU ARE
UNABLE TO AFFORD THE FEE. IF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH $7,500 OR LESS, YOU
MAY FILE YOUR CLAIM IN CONCILIATION COURT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE
CONCILIATION COURT FILING FEE IF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH LESS THAN $500."
    (d) Within 30 days following service of a notice of seizure and forfeiture under this subdivision,
a claimant may file a demand for a judicial determination of the forfeiture. The demand must be in
the form of a civil complaint and must be filed with the court administrator in the county in which
the seizure occurred, together with proof of service of a copy of the complaint on the prosecuting
authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture and the standard filing fee for civil actions unless
the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the value of the seized
property is $7,500 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of the
seized vehicle. A copy of the conciliation court statement of claim must be served personally or by
mail on the prosecuting authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture within 30 days following
service of the notice of seizure and forfeiture under this subdivision. If the value of the seized
property is less than $500, the claimant does not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee. No
responsive pleading is required of the prosecuting authority and no court fees may be charged for
the prosecuting authority's appearance in the matter. Pleadings, filings, and methods of service are
governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure.

    (e) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
vehicle as defendant and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges the
vehicle was improperly seized, the claimant's interest in the vehicle seized, and any affirmative
defenses the claimant may have. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return
of an off-highway vehicle seized under this section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any
person who has been served with a notice of seizure and forfeiture unless the person has complied
with this subdivision.
    (f) If the claimant makes a timely demand for a judicial determination under this subdivision,
the forfeiture proceedings must be conducted according to subdivision 9.
     Subd. 9. Judicial forfeiture procedure. (a) This subdivision governs judicial determinations of
the forfeiture of an off-highway vehicle used to commit a designated offense. An action for forfeiture
is a civil in rem action and is independent of any criminal prosecution. All proceedings are governed
by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (b) If no demand for judicial determination of the forfeiture is pending, the prosecuting authority
may, in the name of the jurisdiction pursuing the forfeiture, file a separate complaint against the
vehicle, describing it, specifying that it was used in the commission of a designated offense, and
specifying the time and place of its unlawful use.
    (c) The prosecuting authority may file an answer to a properly served demand for judicial
determination, including an affirmative counterclaim for forfeiture. The prosecuting authority is
not required to file an answer.
    (d) A judicial determination under this subdivision must not precede adjudication in the
criminal prosecution of the designated offense without the consent of the prosecuting authority.
The district court administrator shall schedule the hearing as soon as practicable after adjudication
in the criminal prosecution. The district court administrator shall establish procedures to ensure
efficient compliance with this subdivision. The hearing is to the court without a jury.
    (e) There is a presumption that an off-highway vehicle seized under this section is subject to
forfeiture if the prosecuting authority establishes that the vehicle was used in the commission of a
designated offense. A claimant bears the burden of proving any affirmative defense raised.
   (f) If the forfeiture is based on the commission of a designated offense and the person charged
with the designated offense appears in court as required and is not convicted of the offense, the court
shall order the property returned to the person legally entitled to it upon that person's compliance
with the redemption requirements of subdivision 12.
    (g) If the lawful ownership of the vehicle used in the commission of a designated offense can
be determined and the owner makes the demonstration required under subdivision 7, paragraph
(d), the vehicle must be returned immediately upon the owner's compliance with the redemption
requirements of subdivision 12.
     (h) If the court orders the return of a seized vehicle under this subdivision, it must order that
filing fees be reimbursed to the person who filed the demand for judicial determination. In addition,
the court may order sanctions under section 549.211. Any reimbursement fees or sanctions must
be paid from other forfeiture proceeds of the law enforcement agency and prosecuting authority
involved and in the same proportion as distributed under subdivision 10, paragraph (b).
26TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MARCH 26, 2009                                          1107

   Subd. 10. Disposition of forfeited vehicle. (a) If the vehicle is administratively forfeited under
subdivision 8, or if the court finds under subdivision 9 that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture under
subdivisions 6 and 7, the appropriate agency shall:
   (1) sell the vehicle and distribute the proceeds under paragraph (b); or
    (2) keep the vehicle for official use. If the agency keeps a forfeited off-highway vehicle for
official use, the agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the off-highway vehicle is
available for use by the agency's officers who participate in off-highway vehicle enforcement or
education programs.
    (b) The proceeds from the sale of forfeited vehicles, after payment of seizure, towing, storage,
forfeiture, and sale expenses and satisfaction of valid liens against the property, must be distributed
as follows:
   (1) 70 percent of the proceeds must be forwarded to the appropriate agency for deposit as a
supplement to the state or local agency's operating fund or similar fund for use in purchasing
equipment for off-highway vehicle enforcement, training, and education; and
    (2) 30 percent of the money or proceeds must be forwarded to the prosecuting authority
that handled the forfeiture for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for
prosecutorial purposes.
    Subd. 11. Sale of forfeited vehicle by secured party. (a) A financial institution with a valid
security interest in or a valid lease covering a forfeited off-highway vehicle may choose to dispose
of the vehicle under this subdivision, in lieu of the appropriate agency disposing of the vehicle
under subdivision 10. A financial institution wishing to dispose of an off-highway vehicle under
this subdivision shall notify the appropriate agency of its intent, in writing, within 30 days after
receiving notice of the seizure and forfeiture. The appropriate agency shall release the vehicle to
the financial institution or its agent after the financial institution presents proof of its valid security
agreement or of its lease agreement and the financial institution agrees not to sell the vehicle to a
family or household member of the violator, unless the violator is not convicted of the offense on
which the forfeiture is based. The financial institution shall dispose of the vehicle in a commercially
reasonable manner as defined in section 336.9-610.
    (b) After disposing of the forfeited vehicle, the financial institution shall reimburse the
appropriate agency for its seizure, storage, and forfeiture costs. The financial institution may then
apply the proceeds of the sale to its storage costs, to its sale expenses, and to satisfy the lien or the
lease on the vehicle. If any proceeds remain, the financial institution shall forward the proceeds to
the state treasury, which shall credit the appropriate fund as specified in subdivision 10.
    Subd. 12. Redemption requirements. (a) If an off-highway vehicle is seized by a peace officer
for a designated offense, the seized vehicle must be released only:
    (1) to the registered owner, a person authorized by the registered owner, a lienholder of record, or
a person who has purchased the vehicle from the registered owner who provides proof of ownership
of the vehicle;
   (2) if the vehicle is subject to a rental or lease agreement, to a renter or lessee who provides a
copy of the rental or lease agreement; or
1108                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [26TH DAY

   (3) to an agent of a towing company authorized by a registered owner if the owner provides
proof of ownership of the vehicle.
   (b) The proof of ownership or, if applicable, the copy of the rental or lease agreement required
under paragraph (a) must be provided to the law enforcement agency seizing the vehicle or to a
person or entity designated by the law enforcement agency to receive the information.
    (c) No law enforcement agency, local unit of government, or state agency is responsible or
financially liable for any storage fees incurred due to a seizure under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2009, and applies to crimes committed
on or after that date.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 84.928, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Crossing a public road right-of-way. (a) An all-terrain vehicle may make a direct
crossing of a public road right-of-way provided:
    (1) the crossing is made at an angle of approximately 90 degrees to the direction of the road and
at a place where no obstruction prevents a quick and safe crossing;
    (2) the vehicle is brought to a complete stop before crossing the shoulder or main-traveled way
of the road;
   (3) the driver yields the right-of-way to all oncoming traffic that constitutes an immediate hazard;
   (4) in crossing a divided road, the crossing is made only at an intersection of the road with
another public road; and
   (5) if the crossing is made between the hours of one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before
sunrise or in conditions of reduced visibility, only if both front and rear lights are on.
    (b) An all-terrain vehicle may be operated upon a bridge, other than a bridge that is part of the
main-traveled lanes of an interstate highway, or roadway shoulder or inside bank of a public road
right-of-way when required for the purpose of avoiding obstructions to travel or environmentally
sensitive areas when no other method of avoidance is possible; provided the all-terrain vehicle is
operated in the extreme right-hand lane, the entrance to the roadway is made within 100 feet of the
bridge ­o­
         r, obstacle, or sensitive area, and the crossing is made without undue delay.
    (c) A person shall not operate an all-terrain vehicle upon a public street or highway unless the
vehicle is equipped with at least one headlight and one taillight, each of minimum candlepower as
prescribed by rules of the commissioner, and with brakes conforming to standards prescribed by
rule of the commissioner, and all of which are subject to the approval of the commissioner of public
safety.
    (d) An all-terrain vehicle may be operated upon a public road right-of-way other than as
provided by paragraph (b) in an emergency during the period of time when and at locations where
the condition of the roadway renders travel by automobile impractical.
   (e) Chapters 169 and 169A apply to the operation of all-terrain vehicles upon streets and
highways, except for those provisions relating to required equipment and except those provisions
which by their nature have no application.

    (f) A sled, trailer, or other device being towed by an all-terrain vehicle must be equipped with
reflective materials as required by rule of the commissioner.
   (g) A driver's license is not required to operate an all-terrain vehicle along or on a public
road right-of-way if the right-of-way encompasses a trail administered by the commissioner and
designated for all-terrain vehicle use or multiple use.
    (h) A road authority as defined in section 160.02, subdivision 25, may by permit designate
corridor access trails on public road rights-of-way for purposes of accessing established all-terrain
vehicle trails. A driver's license is not required to operate an all-terrain vehicle on a designated
corridor access trail."
