intended for human consumption, or any part of such a product, that is not tobacco as defined by

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.445, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 5c. Homeless prevention and food shelf checkoff. A tax preparer must give written
notice of the option to contribute to the homeless prevention and food shelf management account
in sections 290.433 and 290.434 to corporate clients that file an income tax return and to individual
clients who file an income tax return or property tax refund claim form. This notification must be
included with information sent to the client at the same time as the preliminary worksheets or other
documents used in preparing the client's return and must include a line for displaying contributions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2009 and before January 1, 2013.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.08, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Composite income tax returns for nonresident partners, shareholders, and
beneficiaries. (a) The commissioner may allow a partnership with nonresident partners to file a
composite return and to pay the tax on behalf of nonresident partners who have no other Minnesota
source income. This composite return must include the names, addresses, Social Security numbers,
income allocation, and tax liability for the nonresident partners electing to be covered by the
composite return.
    (b) The computation of a partner's tax liability must be determined by multiplying the income
allocated to that partner by the highest rate used to determine the tax liability for individuals
under section 290.06, subdivision 2c. Nonbusiness deductions, standard deductions, or personal
exemptions are not allowed.
    (c) The partnership must submit a request to use this composite return filing method for
nonresident partners. The requesting partnership must file a composite return in the form prescribed
by the commissioner of revenue. The filing of a composite return is considered a request to use the
composite return filing method.
    (d) The electing partner must not have any Minnesota source income other than the income from
the partnership and other electing partnerships. If it is determined that the electing partner has other
Minnesota source income, the inclusion of the income and tax liability for that partner under this
provision will not constitute a return to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 1. The tax paid for
the individual as part of the composite return is allowed as a payment of the tax by the individual
on the date on which the composite return payment was made. If the electing nonresident partner
has no other Minnesota source income, filing of the composite return is a return for purposes of
subdivision 1.
    (e) This subdivision does not negate the requirement that an individual pay estimated tax if
the individual's liability would exceed the requirements set forth in section 289A.25. A composite
estimate may, however, be filed in a manner similar to and containing the information required under
paragraph (a).
    (f) If an electing partner's share of the partnership's gross income from Minnesota sources is
less than the filing requirements for a nonresident under this subdivision, the tax liability is zero.
However, a statement showing the partner's share of gross income must be included as part of the
composite return.

    (g) The election provided in this subdivision is only available to a partner who has no other
Minnesota source income and who is either (1) a full-year nonresident individual or (2) a trust or
estate that does not claim a deduction under either section 651 or 661 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (h) A corporation defined in section 290.9725 and its nonresident shareholders may make an
election under this paragraph. The provisions covering the partnership apply to the corporation and
the provisions applying to the partner apply to the shareholder.
    (i) Estates and trusts distributing current income only and the nonresident individual
beneficiaries of the estates or trusts may make an election under this paragraph. The provisions
covering the partnership apply to the estate or trust. The provisions applying to the partner apply to
the beneficiary.
     (j) For the purposes of this subdivision, "income" means the partner's share of federal adjusted
gross income from the partnership modified by the additions provided in section 290.01, subdivision
19a, clauses (6) to (10), and the subtractions provided in: (i) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause
­
(9
 ­­) (8), to the extent the amount is assignable or allocable to Minnesota under section 290.17; and
(ii) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause ­  (1
                                                 ­4­­
                                                    ) (13). The subtraction allowed under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause ­  (9
                            ­­
                             ) (8), is only allowed on the composite tax computation to the extent the
electing partner would have been allowed the subtraction.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

3, or persons required to withhold tax under section 290.923, subdivision 2, determined without
regard to section 290.92, subdivision 19, if the employee or payee had claimed no more than one
withholding exemption, or who paid wages or made payments not subject to withholding under
section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or 290.923, subdivision 2, to an employee or person receiving
royalty payments in excess of $600, or who has entered into a voluntary withholding agreement
with a payee under section 290.92, subdivision 20, must give every employee or person receiving
royalty payments in respect to the remuneration paid by the person to the employee or person
receiving royalty payments during the calendar year, on or before January 31 of the succeeding

the date of receipt of a written request from the employee if the 30-day period ends before January
31, a written statement showing the following:
    (1) name of the person;
   (2) the name of the employee or payee and the employee's or payee's Social Security account
number;
    (3) the total amount of wages as that term is defined in section 290.92, subdivision 1, paragraph
(1); the total amount of remuneration subject to withholding under section 290.92, subdivision 20;
the amount of sick pay as required under section 6051(f) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the
amount of royalties subject to withholding under section 290.923, subdivision 2; and
    (4) the total amount deducted and withheld as tax under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or

      Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.30, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Estate tax. Where good cause exists, the commissioner may extend the time for
payment of estate tax for a period of not more than six months. If an extension to pay the federal
estate tax has been granted under section 6161 of the Internal Revenue Code, the time for payment
of the estate tax without penalty is extended for that period. A taxpayer who owes at least $5,000
in taxes and who, under section 6161 or 6166 of the Internal Revenue Code has been granted
an extension for payment of the tax shown on the return, may elect to pay the tax due to the
commissioner in equal amounts at the same time as required for federal purposes. A taxpayer
electing to pay the tax in installments shall defer a percentage of tax that does not exceed the
percentage of federal tax deferred and must notify the commissioner in writing no later than nine
months after the death of the person whose estate is subject to taxation. If the taxpayer fails to pay
an installment on time, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause, the election is

    Subd. 4. Notice of refund. The commissioner shall determine the amount of refund, if any, that
is due, and notify the taxpayer of the determination as soon as practicable after a claim has been
filed.
    If the commissioner determines that the address provided by the taxpayer to claim a refund
is invalid or is no longer the current address of the taxpayer, then the date of the mailing of the
notification provided under this subdivision is considered the date that the refund is paid for purposes
of the payment of interest under section 289A.56 and is considered the date of issuance of the original

claim for refund but which does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the
purported return or claim for refund may be judged or contains information that on its face shows
that the purported return or claim for refund is substantially incorrect and the conduct is due to a

other than Minnesota exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code or any
other federal statute; and

in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of this paragraph, the

Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), (13), (16), and (17), and reduced

    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.067, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Amount of credit. (a) A taxpayer may take as a credit against the tax due from
the taxpayer and a spouse, if any, under this chapter an amount equal to the dependent care credit
for which the taxpayer is eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Internal Revenue
Code subject to the limitations provided in subdivision 2 except that in determining whether the
child qualified as a dependent, income received as a Minnesota family investment program grant or
allowance to or on behalf of the child must not be taken into account in determining whether the
child received more than half of the child's support from the taxpayer, and the provisions of section
32(b)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply.
    (b) If a child who has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year is cared
for at a licensed family day care home operated by the child's parent, the taxpayer is deemed to
have paid employment-related expenses. If the child is 16 months old or younger at the close of the
taxable year, the amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the maximum limit for one
qualified individual under section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the child is older
than 16 months of age but has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year, the
amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the amount the licensee would charge for the
care of a child of the same age for the same number of hours of care.
    (c) If a married couple:

   (1) has a child who has not attained the age of one year at the close of the taxable year;
   (2) files a joint tax return for the taxable year; and
    (3) does not participate in a dependent care assistance program as defined in section 129 of the
Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the actual employment related expenses paid for that child under
paragraph (a) or the deemed amount under paragraph (b), the lesser of (i) the combined earned
income of the couple or (ii) the amount of the maximum limit for one qualified individual under
section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code will be deemed to be the employment related
expense paid for that child. The earned income limitation of section 21(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code shall not apply to this deemed amount. These deemed amounts apply regardless of whether
any employment-related expenses have been paid.
    (d) If the taxpayer is not required and does not file a federal individual income tax return for the
tax year, no credit is allowed for any amount paid to any person unless:
    (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person are included on the return
claiming the credit; or
    (2) if the person is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the name and address of
the person are included on the return claiming the credit.
In the case of a failure to provide the information required under the preceding sentence, the
preceding sentence does not apply if it is shown that the taxpayer exercised due diligence in
attempting to provide the information required.

must be allocated based on the ratio by which the earned income of the claimant and the claimant's
spouse from Minnesota sources bears to the total earned income of the claimant and the claimant's
spouse.

    Subdivision 1. Credit allowed. (a) An individual is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
this chapter equal to a percentage of earned income. To receive a credit, a taxpayer must be eligible
for a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (b) For individuals with no qualifying children, the credit equals 1.9125 percent of the first
$4,620 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 1.9125 percent of earned income or adjusted

    (c) For individuals with one qualifying child, the credit equals 8.5 percent of the first $6,920 of
earned income and 8.5 percent of earned income over $12,080 but less than $13,450. The credit is
reduced by 5.73 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess
of $15,080, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (d) For individuals with two or more qualifying children, the credit equals ten percent of the first
$9,720 of earned income and 20 percent of earned income over $14,860 but less than $16,800. The
credit is reduced by 10.3 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater,
in excess of $17,890, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (e) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage
calculated under section 290.06, subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).

purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses ­  (1

in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted
for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $3,000 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the commissioner shall annually adjust
the $3,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word "2007" shall be substituted for the word
"1992." For 2009, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months
ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of
the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be
rounded to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10.
The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    (h) The commissioner shall construct tables showing the amount of the credit at various income
levels and make them available to taxpayers. The tables shall follow the schedule contained in this
subdivision, except that the commissioner may graduate the transition between income brackets.

and tax preference items in sections 56, 57, 58, and 59(d), (e), (f), and (h) of the Internal Revenue

any modification made in a taxable year under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota
Statutes 1986, section 290.09, subdivision 7, paragraph (c).

section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that is required as an addition under section 290.01,
subdivision 19c, clause (15), is disallowed in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
   (3) The subtraction for depreciation allowed under section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause ­
                                                                                              (1

    (4) The alternative tax net operating loss deduction under sections 56(a)(4) and 56(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (5) The special rule for certain dividends under section 56(g)(4)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.

Revenue Code must be calculated without regard to subparagraph (E) and the subtraction under

Code does not apply.

57(a)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (11) For purposes of calculating the tax preference for accelerated depreciation or amortization
on certain property placed in service before January 1, 1987, under section 57(a)(7) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the deduction allowable for the taxable year is the deduction allowed under section
290.01, subdivision 19e.
  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, the amount of any remaining modification
made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, not previously deducted is a depreciation or
amortization allowance in the first taxable year after December 31, 2004.
    (12) For purposes of calculating the adjustment for adjusted current earnings in section 56(g) of
the Internal Revenue Code, the term "alternative minimum taxable income" as it is used in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, means alternative minimum taxable income as defined in this
subdivision, determined without regard to the adjustment for adjusted current earnings in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.

and (f) of the Internal Revenue Code is assigned to this state if, and to the extent that, the work of
the employee is performed within it; all other income from such sources is treated as income from
sources without this state.
   Severance pay shall be considered income from labor or personal or professional services.
    (2) In the case of an individual who is a nonresident of Minnesota and who is an athlete or
entertainer, income from compensation for labor or personal services performed within this state
shall be determined in the following manner:
    (i) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident
salaried athletic team employee shall be determined by using a fraction in which the denominator
contains the total number of days in which the individual is under a duty to perform for the
employer, and the numerator is the total number of those days spent in Minnesota. For purposes
of this paragraph, off-season training activities, unless conducted at the team's facilities as part of
a team imposed program, are not included in the total number of duty days. Bonuses earned as a
result of play during the regular season or for participation in championship, play-off, or all-star
games must be allocated under the formula. Signing bonuses are not subject to allocation under the
formula if they are not conditional on playing any games for the team, are payable separately from
any other compensation, and are nonrefundable; and
    (ii) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident,
and who is an athlete or entertainer not listed in clause (i), for that person's athletic or entertainment
performance in Minnesota shall be determined by assigning to this state all income from
performances or athletic contests in this state.
    (3) For purposes of this section, amounts received by a nonresident as "retirement income" as
defined in section (b)(1) of the State Income Taxation of Pension Income Act, Public Law 104-95,
are not considered income derived from carrying on a trade or business or from wages or other
compensation for work an employee performed in Minnesota, and are not taxable under this chapter.
   (b) Income or gains from tangible property located in this state that is not employed in the
business of the recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state.
    (c) Income or gains from intangible personal property not employed in the business of the
recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state if the recipient of the income or gains
is a resident of this state or is a resident trust or estate.
    Gain on the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original
cost of partnership tangible property in this state to the original cost of partnership tangible
property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. If more than 50 percent of the value of
the partnership's assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest
is allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full
tax period immediately preceding the tax period of the partnership during which the partnership
interest was sold.
    Gain on the sale of an interest in a single member limited liability company that is disregarded
for federal income tax purposes is allocable to this state as if the single member limited liability
company did not exist and the assets of the limited liability company are personally owned by the
sole member.

   Gain on the sale of goodwill or income from a covenant not to compete that is connected with
a business operating all or partially in Minnesota is allocated to this state to the extent that the
income from the business in the year preceding the year of sale was assignable to Minnesota under

    When an employer pays an employee for a covenant not to compete, the income allocated to this
state is in the ratio of the employee's service in Minnesota in the calendar year preceding leaving the
employment of the employer over the total services performed by the employee for the employer in
that year.
    (d) Income from winnings on a bet made by an individual while in Minnesota is assigned to this
state. In this paragraph, "bet" has the meaning given in section 609.75, subdivision 2, as limited by
section 609.75, subdivision 3, clauses (1), (2), and (3).
   (e) All items of gross income not covered in paragraphs (a) to (d) and not part of the taxpayer's
income from a trade or business shall be assigned to the taxpayer's domicile.
   (f) For the purposes of this section, working as an employee shall not be considered to be
conducting a trade or business.

an election under section 243(b) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
    (iii) the remaining 20 percent of the dividends if the dividends are received from a property and
casualty insurer as defined under section 60A.60, subdivision 8, which is a member of an affiliated
group of corporations as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and either: (A) the dividend is
eliminated in consolidation under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-14(a), as amended through December
31, 1989; or (B) the dividend is deducted under an election under section 243(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code.

provisions of Public Law 86-272 are included as income on the return of an affiliated corporation
permitted or required to file a combined report under section 290.17, subdivision 4, or 290.34,
subdivision 2, then for purposes of this subdivision the determination as to whether the trade or
business of the corporation consists principally of the holding of stocks and the collection of income
and gains therefrom shall be made with reference to the trade or business of the affiliated corporation
having a nexus with Minnesota.
    (e) The deduction provided by this subdivision does not apply if the dividends are paid by a FSC

December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula or provision referring to
the "unified credit," "estate tax exemption," "applicable exemption amount," "applicable credit
amount," "applicable exclusion amount," "generation-skipping transfer tax exemption," "GST
exemption," "marital deduction," "maximum marital deduction," "unlimited marital deduction,"
"inclusion ratio," "applicable fraction," or any section of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the

trust by reference to federal estate taxes or federal generation-skipping transfer taxes, is deemed to
refer to the federal estate tax and the federal generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they applied
with respect to the estates of decedents dying on December 31, 2009. This paragraph does not
apply to a governing instrument, including a will or trust agreement, that manifests an intent that
a contrary rule applies if the decedent dies on a date on which there is no then-applicable federal
estate or federal generation-skipping transfer tax.

including a will or trust agreement, may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent
intended that a formula or provision described in paragraph (a) be construed with respect to the law
as it existed after December 31, 2009. Such a proceeding must be commenced by December 31,
2011.

shipped or brought to Minnesota by the purchaser has the burden of proving that the property was
not purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or consumption in Minnesota.
    (f) If a seller claims that certain sales are exempt and does not provide the certificate, information,
or proof required by paragraph (b), clause (2), within 120 days after the date of the commissioner's

service providers are relieved from liability to the state for having charged and collected the incorrect
amount of sales or use tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider (1) relying on
erroneous data provided by the commissioner in the database files on tax rates, boundaries, or taxing
jurisdiction assignments, or (2) relying on erroneous data provided by the state in its taxability matrix
concerning the taxability of products and services.
    (b) Notwithstanding subdivision 9, sellers and certified service providers are relieved from
liability to the state for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales or use
tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider relying on the certification by the
commissioner as to the accuracy of a certified automated system as to the taxability of product
categories. The relief from liability provided by this paragraph does not apply when the sellers or
certified service providers have incorrectly classified an item or transaction into a product category,
unless the item or transaction within a product category was approved by the commissioner or
approved jointly by the states that are signatories to the agreement. The sellers and certified service
providers must revise a classification within ten days after receipt of notice from the commissioner

they are not relieved from liability for the incorrect classification following the notification.
    (c) Notwithstanding subdivision 9, if there are not at least 30 days between the enactment of a
new tax rate and the effective date of the new rate, sellers and certified service providers shall be
relieved from liability for failing to collect tax at the new rate during the first 30 days of the rate
change, beginning on the day after the date of enactment of the rate change, provided the seller or
certified service provider continued to impose and collect the tax at the immediately preceding tax
rate during this period. Relief from liability provided by this paragraph shall not apply if the failure
to collect at the newly effective rate extends beyond 30 days after the enactment of the new rate.

or certified service provider fraudulently failed to collect at the new rate or that the seller or certified
service provider solicited purchasers based on the immediately preceding tax rate.

data provided by this state in the database files on tax rates, boundaries, taxing jurisdiction
assignments, or in the taxability matrix. After providing an address-based database for assigning
taxing jurisdictions and their associated rates, no relief for errors resulting from the purchaser's
reliance on a database using zip codes is allowed.
    (b) With respect to reliance on the taxability matrix provided by this state in paragraph (a),
relief is limited to erroneous classifications in the taxability matrix for items included within
the classifications as "taxable," "exempt," "included in sales price," "excluded from sales price,"
"included in the definition," and "excluded from the definition."
    (c) Notwithstanding other provisions in the law, if there are not at least 30 days between the
enactment of a new tax rate and the effective date of the new rate, a purchaser shall be relieved from
liability resulting from failing to pay the tax at the new rate during the first 30 days of the rate change,

the tax at the immediately preceding tax rate during the 30-day period. The relief provided by this
paragraph shall not apply if the commissioner determines that the purchaser fraudulently failed to

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), and in lieu of a survey of cigarette retailers, the tax
calculation of the weighted average retail price for the sales of cigarettes from August 1, 2011,
through December 31, 2011, shall be calculated by (1) increasing the average retail price per pack
of 20 cigarettes from the most recent survey by the percentage change in a weighted average of
the presumed legal prices for cigarettes during the year after completion of that survey, as reported
and published by the Department of Commerce under section 325D.371; (2) subtracting the sales
tax included in the retail price; and (3) adjusting for expected inflation. The rate is published by
May 1 and is effective for sales after July 31. If the weighted average of the presumed legal prices
indicates that the average retail price of cigarettes has not increased relative to the average retail
price in the most recent survey, then no inflation adjustment must be made. For packs of cigarettes
with other than 20 cigarettes, the tax must be adjusted proportionally.

     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270.41, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Prohibited activity. A licensed assessor or other person employed by an assessment
jurisdiction or contracting with an assessment jurisdiction for the purpose of valuing or classifying
property for property tax purposes is prohibited from making appraisals or analyses, accepting an
appraisal assignment, or preparing an appraisal report as defined in section 82B.02, subdivisions
2 to 5, on any property within the assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed or
performing the duties of the assessor under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in
immediate revocation of the individual's license to assess property for property tax purposes. This
prohibition must not be construed to prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required
for the proper assessment of property for property tax purposes or performing duties enumerated
in section 273.061, subdivision 7 or 8. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing
body of a governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this
prohibition does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the
governmental unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only
allow appraisal activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, or special
assessments.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment for testimony
offered and opinions or reports prepared in cases or proceedings that have not been finally resolved.

land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause
(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this
paragraph for the 1998 assessment.
   (b)(i) Agricultural property shall be classified as the owner's homestead, to the same extent as
other agricultural homestead property, if all of the following criteria are met:
    (1) the property consists of at least 40 acres including undivided government lots and correctional
40's;
    (2) the owner, the owner's spouse, the son or daughter of the owner or owner's spouse, the brother
or sister of the owner or owner's spouse, or the grandson or granddaughter of the owner or the
owner's spouse, is actively farming the agricultural property, either on the person's own behalf as
an individual or on behalf of a partnership operating a family farm, family farm corporation, joint
family farm venture, or limited liability company of which the person is a partner, shareholder, or
member;
    (3) both the owner of the agricultural property and the person who is actively farming the
agricultural property under clause (2), are Minnesota residents;
   (4) neither the owner nor the spouse of the owner claims another agricultural homestead in
Minnesota; and
    (5) neither the owner nor the person actively farming the property lives farther than four
townships or cities, or a combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property,
except that if the owner or the owner's spouse is required to live in employer-provided housing,
the owner or owner's spouse, whichever is actively farming the agricultural property, may live
more than four townships or cities, or combination of four townships or cities from the agricultural
property.
   The relationship under this paragraph may be either by blood or marriage.
    (ii) Real property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for agricultural homestead
classification under this paragraph if the qualifications in clause (i) are met, except that "owner"
means the grantor of the trust.

(i) shall be classified as part of the owner's agricultural homestead, if that property is also used for
noncommercial storage or drying of agricultural crops.
    (c) Noncontiguous land shall be included as part of a homestead under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), only if the homestead is classified as class 2a and the detached land
is located in the same township or city, or not farther than four townships or cities or combination
thereof from the homestead. Any taxpayer of these noncontiguous lands must notify the county
assessor that the noncontiguous land is part of the taxpayer's homestead, and, if the homestead is
located in another county, the taxpayer must also notify the assessor of the other county.
    (d) Agricultural land used for purposes of a homestead and actively farmed by a person holding
a vested remainder interest in it must be classified as a homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a). If agricultural land is classified class 2a, any other dwellings on the land used for
purposes of a homestead by persons holding vested remainder interests who are actively engaged
in farming the property, and up to one acre of the land surrounding each homestead and reasonably
necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home, must also be assessed class 2a.
   (e) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1997 assessment shall remain classified as agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of the April 1997 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Polk, Clay, Kittson, Marshall, Norman, or Wilkin;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 1997 assessment year and continue to be used for agricultural
purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 30 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 1997 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the
change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of damage caused by a March 29, 1998, tornado;
  (2) the property is located in the county of Blue Earth, Brown, Cottonwood, LeSueur, Nicollet,
Nobles, or Rice;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 1998 assessment year;

    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in this state and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to a March 29, 1998,
tornado, and the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in
verifying the change in homestead dwelling. For taxes payable in 1999, the owner must notify the
assessor by December 1, 1998. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property
continues to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land
remain uninhabited.
    (g) Agricultural property of a family farm corporation, joint family farm venture, family farm
limited liability company, or partnership operating a family farm as described under subdivision 8
shall be classified homestead, to the same extent as other agricultural homestead property, if all of
the following criteria are met:
    (1) the property consists of at least 40 acres including undivided government lots and correctional
40's;
   (2) a shareholder, member, or partner of that entity is actively farming the agricultural property;
   (3) that shareholder, member, or partner who is actively farming the agricultural property is a

    (4) neither that shareholder, member, or partner, nor the spouse of that shareholder, member, or
partner claims another agricultural homestead in Minnesota; and
   (5) that shareholder, member, or partner does not live farther than four townships or cities, or a
combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property.
    Homestead treatment applies under this paragraph for property leased to a family farm
corporation, joint farm venture, limited liability company, or partnership operating a family farm if
legal title to the property is in the name of an individual who is a member, shareholder, or partner
in the entity.
    (h) To be eligible for the special agricultural homestead under this subdivision, an initial full
application must be submitted to the county assessor where the property is located. Owners and
the persons who are actively farming the property shall be required to complete only a one-page
abbreviated version of the application in each subsequent year provided that none of the following
items have changed since the initial application:
   (1) the day-to-day operation, administration, and financial risks remain the same;
   (2) the owners and the persons actively farming the property continue to live within the four
townships or city criteria and are Minnesota residents;
   (3) the same operator of the agricultural property is listed with the Farm Service Agency;
   (4) a Schedule F or equivalent income tax form was filed for the most recent year;
   (5) the property's acreage is unchanged; and
   (6) none of the property's acres have been enrolled in a federal or state farm program since the
91ST DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                     9849

initial application.
    The owners and any persons who are actively farming the property must include the appropriate
Social Security numbers, and sign and date the application. If any of the specified information has
changed since the full application was filed, the owner must notify the assessor, and must complete
a new application to determine if the property continues to qualify for the special agricultural
homestead. The commissioner of revenue shall prepare a standard reapplication form for use by
the assessors.
   (i) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 2007 assessment shall remain classified agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of damage caused by the August 2007 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Dodge, Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Steele, Wabasha,
or Winona;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 2007 assessment year;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in this state and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the August 2007 floods,
and the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying
the change in homestead dwelling. For taxes payable in 2009, the owner must notify the assessor
by December 1, 2008. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (j) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 2008 assessment shall remain classified as agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of the March 2009 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Marshall;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 2008 assessment year and continue to be used for agricultural
purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 2009 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the
change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues

uninhabited.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessment years 2010 and 2011, for taxes
payable in 2011 and 2012.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by:
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse;
   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse; or
    (3) the surviving spouse of a permanently and totally disabled veteran homesteading a property
classified under this paragraph for taxes payable in 2008.
    Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
    (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250
days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead
by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation
that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited
liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a
91ST DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                       9851

commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used
exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential
occupancy. Class 1c property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined
as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with
water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational
activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or
cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell
bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the property is transferred to an individual
or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class 1c even
though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise
qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the
use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. If an owner of property that had been classified
as class 1c ceases to use that property as a homestead but retains ownership of that property and
continues to operate it as a resort, and begins to occupy a second property that is located in the
same township as the original class 1c property, both properties will be assessed as a single class
1c property, provided that the second property would separately qualify to be assessed as class 1c
property. The portion of the property used as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a).
The remainder of the property is classified as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier I,
the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class
rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent; tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of
real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation
purposes in which all or a portion of the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not
more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c,
must submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days
or less in the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those
cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated
as class 1c as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share
of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of
property desiring designation as class 1c property must provide guest registers or other records
demonstrating that the units for which class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5)
other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
      (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
9852                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [91ST DAY

ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2010, payable in 2011, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
91ST DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                       9853

property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
9854                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding

pasture to graze horses or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
91ST DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                         9855

public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
9856                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for property taxes levied in 2010 and thereafter,
for property taxes payable in 2011 and thereafter.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 25, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods

determination, a paid booking of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c
property classified under this clause also includes commercial use real property used exclusively
for recreational purposes in conjunction with other class 4c property classified under this clause

assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must submit a declaration to the assessor designating

be held before 6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers
may call if they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received
by mail.
    (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;

    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for

contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

included with the appropriate county's levy.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the

   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 275.70, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Special levies. "Special levies" means those portions of ad valorem taxes levied by a

   (3) to provide for the bonded indebtedness portion of payments made to another political

   (4) to fund payments made to the Minnesota State Armory Building Commission under section

    (8) pay amounts required to correct an error in the levy certified to the county auditor by a city
or county in a levy year, but only to the extent that when added to the preceding year's levy it is not
in excess of an applicable statutory, special law or charter limitation, or the limitation imposed on
the governmental subdivision by sections 275.70 to 275.74 in the preceding levy year;
   (9) to pay an abatement under section 469.1815;

included in the county budget as a direct result of a rule, minimum requirement, minimum standard,
or directive of the Department of Corrections, or to pay the operating or maintenance costs of a
regional jail as authorized in section 641.262. For purposes of this clause, a district court order is
not a rule, minimum requirement, minimum standard, or directive of the Department of Corrections.
If the county utilizes this special levy, except to pay operating or maintenance costs of a new regional
jail facility under sections 641.262 to 641.264 which will not replace an existing jail facility, any
amount levied by the county in the previous levy year for the purposes specified under this clause
and included in the county's previous year's levy limitation computed under section 275.71, shall
be deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71, subdivision 2, when determining the
county's current year levy limitation. The county shall provide the necessary information to the
commissioner of revenue for making this determination;
     (12) to pay for operation of a lake improvement district, as authorized under section 103B.555.
If the county utilizes this special levy, any amount levied by the county in the previous levy year for
the purposes specified under this clause and included in the county's previous year's levy limitation
computed under section 275.71 shall be deducted from the levy limit base under section 275.71,
subdivision 2, when determining the county's current year levy limitation. The county shall provide
the necessary information to the commissioner of revenue for making this determination;
    (13) to repay a state or federal loan used to fund the direct or indirect required spending by
the local government due to a state or federal transportation project or other state or federal capital
project. This authority may only be used if the project is not a local government initiative;
    (14) to pay for court administration costs as required under section 273.1398, subdivision 4b,
less the (i) county's share of transferred fines and fees collected by the district courts in the county
for calendar year 2001 and (ii) the aid amount certified to be paid to the county in 2004 under section
273.1398, subdivision 4c; however, for taxes levied to pay for these costs in the year in which the
court financing is transferred to the state, the amount under this clause is limited to the amount of
aid the county is certified to receive under section 273.1398, subdivision 4a;
    (15) to fund a police or firefighters relief association as required under section 69.77 to the extent
that the required amount exceeds the amount levied for this purpose in 2001;

   (17) to pay for the maintenance and support of a city or county society for the prevention of

is greater. If the city or county uses this special levy, any amount levied by the city or county in
the previous levy year for the purposes specified in this clause and included in the city's or county's
previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be deducted from the levy limit base
under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or county's current year levy limit;
    (18) for counties, to pay for the increase in their share of health and human service costs caused
by reductions in federal health and human services grants effective after September 30, 2007;
    (19) for a city, for the costs reasonably and necessarily incurred for securing, maintaining, or
demolishing foreclosed or abandoned residential properties, as allowed by the commissioner of
revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2. A city must have either (i) a foreclosure rate of at least
1.4 percent in 2007, or (ii) a foreclosure rate in 2007 in the city or in a zip code area of the city that
is at least 50 percent higher than the average foreclosure rate in the metropolitan area, as defined in
section 473.121, subdivision 2, to use this special levy. For purposes of this paragraph, "foreclosure
rate" means the number of foreclosures, as indicated by sheriff sales records, divided by the number
of households in the city in 2007;
    (20) for a city, for the unreimbursed costs of redeployed traffic-control agents and lost traffic
citation revenue due to the collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge, as certified to the Federal Highway
Administration;
    (21) to pay costs attributable to wages and benefits for sheriff, police, and fire personnel. If a local
governmental unit did not use this special levy in the previous year its levy limit base under section
275.71 shall be reduced by the amount equal to the amount it levied for the purposes specified in
this clause in the previous year;
     (22) an amount equal to any reductions in the certified aids or ­c­ d­t
                                                                        e­

payable under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014, and section 273.1384, due to unallotment under

amount is not known by September 1 of the levy certification year, and the local government has
not adjusted its levy under section 275.065, subdivision 6, or 275.07, subdivision 6, in which case

t­­e that unallotment amount may be levied in the following year;
    (23) to pay for the difference between one-half of the costs of confining sex offenders undergoing
the civil commitment process and any state payments for this purpose pursuant to section 253B.185,

new expansion, either of which contains courts, corrections, dispatch, criminal investigation labs,
or other public safety facilities and for which all or a portion of the funding for the site acquisition,
building design, site preparation, construction, and related equipment was issued or authorized prior
to the imposition of levy limits in 2008. The levy limit base shall then be increased by an amount
equal to the new facility's first full year's operating costs as described in this clause; and
    (25) for the estimated amount of reduction to credits under section 273.1384 for credits payable
in the year in which the levy is payable.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively for taxes payable in 2010 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.71, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Adjusted levy limit base. For taxes levied in 2008 through 2010, the adjusted levy
limit base is equal to the levy limit base computed under subdivision 2 or section 275.72, multiplied
by:
    (1) one plus the lesser of (i) 3.9 percent, or (ii) the greater of 1.17 percent, or the percentage

      t­ increase in the implicit price deflator;
   (2) one plus a percentage equal to 50 percent of the percentage increase in the number of
households, if any, for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available; and
   (3) one plus a percentage equal to 50 percent of the percentage increase in the taxable market
value of the jurisdiction due to new construction of class 3 property, as defined in section 273.13,
subdivision 4, except for state-assessed utility and railroad property, for the most recent year for
which data is available.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2010, payable in 2011 only.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.71, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Property tax levy limit. (a) For taxes levied in 2008 through 2010, the property tax
levy limit for a local governmental unit is equal to its adjusted levy limit base determined under
subdivision 4 plus any additional levy authorized under section 275.73, which is levied against net
tax capacity, reduced by the sum of (i) the total amount of aids and reimbursements that the local
governmental unit is certified to receive under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014, (ii) taconite aids
under sections 298.28 and 298.282 including any aid which was required to be placed in a special
fund for expenditure in the next succeeding year, (iii) estimated payments to the local governmental
unit under section 272.029, adjusted for any error in estimation in the preceding year, and (iv) aids
under section 477A.16.
    (b) If an aid, payment, or other amount used in paragraph (a) to reduce a local government unit's
levy limit is reduced by an unallotment under section 16A.152, the amount of the aid, payment, or
other amount prior to the unallotment is used in the computations in paragraph (a). In order for a
local government unit to levy outside of its limit to offset the reduction in revenues attributable to
an unallotment, it must do so under, and to the extent authorized by, a special levy authorization.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively for taxes payable in 2010 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 276.02, is amended to read:
   276.02 TREASURER TO BE COLLECTOR.
     The county treasurer shall collect all taxes extended on the tax lists of the county and the fines,
forfeitures, or penalties received by any person or officer for the use of the county. The treasurer shall

States currency or by check o   ­­r, money order, or electronic payments, including, but not limited
to, automated clearing house transactions and federal wires drawn on a bank or other financial
institution in the United States. The county board may by resolution authorize the treasurer to impose
a charge for any dishonored checks or electronic payments. The charges for dishonored payment of
property taxes must be added to the tax and collected as part thereof.
    The county board may, by resolution, authorize the treasurer and/or other designees to accept
payments of real property taxes by credit card provided that a fee is charged for its use. The fee
charged must be commensurate with the costs assessed by the card issuer. If a credit card transaction
under this section is subsequently voided or otherwise reversed, the lien of real property taxes under
section 272.31 is revived and attaches in the manner and time provided in that section as though the
credit card transaction had never occurred, and the voided or reversed credit card transaction shall
not impair the right of a lienholder under section 272.31 to enforce the lien in its favor.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for property taxes payable in 2011 and thereafter.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The tax statement must not state or imply that property tax credits are paid by the state of
Minnesota. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing
authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a particular tax
statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan
special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph (i), must be separately
stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be aggregated except that: (1)
any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy; and (2) any levy by a special taxing district that exceeds 25 percent
of the total of all special taxing district levies on a tax statement must be separately stated. If the
county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey County, if the county levy
under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under section 134.07, the amount
attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county levy amount. The amount
of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax deferral program under
chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the deferred property tax
amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections 270.91 to 270.98, if
any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar amount of any special
assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of this section whole
odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar. The amount of
market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be listed on the tax
statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.

   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:

   (2) the property's taxable market value after reductions under section 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16;

    (4) for homestead residential and agricultural properties, the credits under section 273.1384;
    (5) any credits received under sections 273.119; 273.1234 or 273.1235; 273.135; 273.1391;
273.1398, subdivision 4; 469.171; and 473H.10, except that the amount of credit received under
section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
    (6) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

    475.755 EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES.
    (a) If at any time during a fiscal year the receipts of a local government are reasonably expected
to be reduced below the amount provided in the local government's budget when the final property
tax levy to be collected during the fiscal year was certified and the receipts are insufficient to meet
the expenses incurred or to be incurred during the fiscal year, the governing body of the local
government may authorize and sell certificates of indebtedness to mature within two years or less
from the end of the fiscal year in which the certificates are issued. The maximum principal amount
of the certificates that it may issue in a fiscal year is limited to the expected reduction in receipts plus
the cost of issuance. The certificates may be issued in the manner and on the terms the governing
body determines by resolution.
   (b) The governing body of the local government shall levy taxes for the payment of principal
and interest on the certificates in accordance with section 475.61.
    (c) The certificates are not to be included in the net debt of the issuing local government.

unallotment or other reduction in its state aid, the local government m­­ ay

                                                            , The formula aid for a city is equal to the sum
of (1) its city jobs base, (2) its small city aid base, and (3) the need increase percentage multiplied
by the average of its unmet need for the most recently available two years.

region, especially for growth that results from state or regional decisions;
    (2) the program's impact on the variability of tax rates across jurisdictions of the region;

jurisdictions of the region; and

containing properties that provide regional benefits, specifically the costs those properties impose
on their host jurisdictions in excess of their tax payments.
    The report must include a description of other property tax, aid, and local development programs
that interact with the fiscal disparities program.

must be contiguous, and may use the powers granted in sections 469.090 to 469.108 to carry out its
purposes. First the authority must hold a public hearing on the matter. At least ten days before the
hearing, the authority shall publish notice of the hearing in a daily newspaper of general circulation
in the city. Also, the authority shall find that an economic development district is proper and desirable
to establish and develop within the city.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for economic development districts created after
the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the

district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
    (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that meets the requirement for a qualified low-income
building, as that term is used in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
    (2) not exceed the qualified basis of the housing, as defined under section 42(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, less the amount of any credit allowed under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
and
    (3) be used to:
    (i) acquire and prepare the site of the housing;
    (ii) acquire, construct, or rehabilitate the housing; or
    (iii) make public improvements directly related to the housing; or
     (4) be used to develop housing that does not exceed 150 percent of the average market value
of single-family homes in that municipality and to pay the cost of site acquisition, relocation,
demolition of existing structures, site preparation, and pollution abatement on one or more parcels,
if the parcel:
   (i) contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that has been vacant for six
or more months;
   (ii) contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that is structurally
substandard, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision 10;
    (iii) is in foreclosure as defined in section 325N.10, subdivision 7, but without regard to whether
the residence is the owner's principal residence; or
   (iv) is a vacant site, if the authority uses the parcel in connection with the development or
redevelopment of a parcel qualifying under items (i) to (iii).
    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined in
section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax increment

for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support the
activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j. These expenditures are considered as expenditures for activities within the district.
   (f) The authority under paragraph (d), clause (4), expires on December 31, 2015. Increments
may continue to be expended under this authority after that date, if they are used to pay bonds or
binding contracts that would qualify under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), if December 31, 2015, is
considered to be the last date of the five-year period after certification under that provision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for any district that is subject to the provisions
of section 469.1763, regardless of when the request for certification of the district was made.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.319, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Waiver authority. (a) The commissioner may waive all or part of a repayment required
under subdivision 1, if the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of employment
and economic development and appropriate officials from the local government units in which
the qualified business is located, determines that requiring repayment of the tax is not in the best
interest of the state or the local government units and the business ceased operating as a result of
circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited to:
   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the
commissioner has waived repayment by the operating business under subdivision 1, unless the
person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone was a contributing
factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1;
   (2) the commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:
   (i) the person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone and the
business that operated in the zone are not related parties as defined in section 267(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31, 2007; and
    (ii) actions of the person were not a contributing factor in the qualified business becoming subject
to repayment under subdivision 1.
    (c) Requests for waiver must be made no later than 60 days after the notice date of an order
issued under subdivision 4, paragraph (d), or, in the case of property taxes, within 60 days of the
date of a tax statement issued under subdivision 4, paragraph (c).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for waivers requested in response to notices
issued after the day following final enactment.

AGREEMENT.
    (a) Except as authorized under paragraph (b) or section 469.3191, under no circumstance shall
terms of any agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315
be amended to change job creation, job retention, or wage goals included in the agreement.
    (b) The commissioner may authorize the local unit of government and qualified business that
are parties to a business subsidy agreement to amend the agreement extending the period by one
year for the business to meet business subsidy goals if the business met the goals in 2008 but failed
to meet the goals in 2009 due to economic or business conditions.

commissioner of revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, whether it is
in compliance with any agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under
section 469.315. A business that fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those
still operating in the zone, that submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later
determines materially misrepresents the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to
the repayment provisions under section 469.319 from January 1 of the year in which the report is
due or the date that the business became subject to section 469.319, whichever is earlier. Any such
business is permanently barred from obtaining benefits under section 469.315. For purposes of
this section, the bar applies to an entity and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an
ownership interest of at least 20 percent of the entity.
    (b) Before the sanctions under paragraph (a) apply to a business that fails to submit the
certification, the commissioner of revenue shall send notice to the business, demanding that the
certification be submitted within 30 days and advising the business of the consequences for failing
to do so. The commissioner of revenue shall notify the commissioner of employment and economic
development and the appropriate job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is sent to
a business under this paragraph.
   (c) The certification required under this section is public.
    (d) The commissioner of revenue shall promptly notify the commissioner of employment and
economic development of all businesses that certify that they are not in compliance with the terms
of their business subsidy agreement and all businesses that fail to file the certification.

entitlement issuer whereby the recipient entitlement issuer issues obligations pursuant to bonding
authority allocated to the original entitlement issuer under this section. An entitlement issuer may
enter into an agreement with an issuer which is not an entitlement issuer whereby the recipient issuer
issues qualified mortgage bonds, up to $100,000 of which are issued pursuant to bonding authority
allocated to the original entitlement issuer under this section. The agreement may be approved and
executed by the mayor of the entitlement issuer with or without approval or review by the city
council. Notwithstanding section 474A.091, subdivision 4, prior to December 1, the Minnesota
Housing Finance Agency, Minnesota Office of Higher Education, and Minnesota Rural Finance

there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all manufacturing projects in any
one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded based on the number of
points awarded a project under section 474A.045 with those projects receiving the greatest number
of points receiving allocation first. If two or more applications for manufacturing projects receive
an equal amount of points, available bonding authority shall be awarded by lot unless otherwise
agreed to by the respective issuers.
    (e) If there are two or more applications for enterprise zone facility projects from the unified
pool and there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all enterprise zone facility
projects in any one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded based on
the number of points awarded a project under section 474A.045 with those projects receiving the

there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all residential rental projects in any
one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded in the following order of
priority: (1) projects that preserve existing federally subsidized housing; (2) projects that are not

issue bonds to the extent such amounts are available within the unified pool.

91ST DAY]                                                              WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                                                                                            9887

by the state in trust for the local units as provided in section 281.25, the county board has the
discretion to decide that some lands in public ownership should be retained and managed for
public benefits while other lands should be returned to private ownership. Parcels of land becoming
the property of the state in trust under law declaring the forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes
must be classified by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie as conservation or
nonconservation. In making the classification the board shall consider the present use of adjacent
lands, the productivity of the soil, the character of forest or other growth, accessibility of lands to
established roads, schools, and other public services, their peculiar suitability or desirability for
particular uses, and the suitability of the forest resources on the land for multiple use,
                                                                                         ­ and sustained
yield management. The classification, furthermore, must: (1) encourage and foster a mode of land
utilization that will facilitate the economical and adequate provision of transportation, roads, water
supply, drainage, sanitation, education, and recreation; (2) facilitate reduction of governmental
expenditures; (3) conserve and develop the natural resources; and (4) foster and develop agriculture
and other industries in the districts and places best suited to them.

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
   (c) Prior to meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided

that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site. The
notice must also be mailed or otherwise delivered to each person who has filed a request for notice
of special meetings with the public body, regardless of whether the matter is considered at a regular
or special meeting. The notice must be mailed or delivered at least 60 days before the date of the
meeting. If the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be mailed or
delivered at least 14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The public body shall publish
the notice once, at least 30 days before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within
the area of the public body's authority. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to
each person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided
in chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this
paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D, and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities at the meeting.
    (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent
information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. The county board must solicit and consider any relevant components of
current municipal or metropolitan comprehensive land use plans that incorporate the area in which
the land is located. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay taking
action on any parcel or parcels. In order for a state agency or a governmental subdivision of the
state to preserve its right to request a purchase or other acquisition of a forfeited parcel, it may, at
any time following forfeiture, file a written request to withhold the parcel from sale or lease to others
under the provisions of subdivision 1a.
    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
    (f) A county board may by resolution elect to use the classification and reclassification
procedures provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), instead of the procedures provided in paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d). Once an election is made under this paragraph, it is effective for a minimum of
five years.
    (g) The classification or reclassification of tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released
from the trust may be made by the county board using information made available to it by any
office or department of the federal, state, or local governments, or by any other person or agency
possessing pertinent information at the time the classification is made.
  (h) If the lands are located within the boundaries of an organized town or incorporated
municipality, a classification or reclassification and sale must first be approved by the town board

of the town or the governing body of the municipality in which the lands are located. The town
board of the town or the governing body of the municipality is considered to have approved the
classification or reclassification and sale if the county board is not notified of the disapproval of
the classification or reclassification and sale within 60 days of the date the request for approval
was transmitted to the town board of the town or governing body of the municipality. If the town
board or governing body disapproves of the classification or reclassification and sale, the county
board must follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) and (d), with regard to the parcel, and must
additionally cause to be published in a newspaper a notice of the date, time, location, and purpose
of the required meeting.
    (i) If a town board or a governing body of a municipality or a park and recreation board in a
city of the first class desires to acquire any parcel lying in the town or municipality by procedures
authorized in this section, it may file a written request under subdivision 1a, paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:

                                         ­ to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state
agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be
withheld from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted
to the county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease
to any other party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding
period to the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision
of the state, the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county
during the period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to
the requesting party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting
party terminates the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property o­­
                                                                                           r. When
the term "market value" is used in this section, it means an estimate of the full and actual market
value of the parcel as determined by the county board, but in making this determination, the board
and the persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist
in the determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application o
                         ­­
                          f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:

   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market, or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.

recommendation of the county board. For the purposes of this paragraph, "authorized public use"
means a use that allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property
in numbers appropriate to its size and use, or is for a public service facility. Authorized public uses
as defined in this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, athletic fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit facilities for buses, light rail transit, commuter rail or passenger rail, including transit
ways, park-and-ride lots, transit stations, maintenance and garage facilities, and other facilities
related to a public transit system;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water towers, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
No monetary compensation or consideration is required for the conveyance, except as provided in
subdivision 1g, but the conveyance is subject to the conditions provided in law, including, but not
limited to, the reversion provisions of subdivisions 1c and 1d.

board that prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement or instrument, but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or
consideration is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that prior to forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed
to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions
attach to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state
for less than its market value for either: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant
limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed
back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall be
refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.
   (i) A park and recreation board in a city of the first class is a governmental subdivision for the
purposes of this section.

property to the approved authorized public use for which it was conveyed, or an abandonment of
that use, except as provided in subdivision 1d.

the purposes of this paragraph, there is no failure to put the land to the authorized public use and
no abandonment of that use if a formal plan of the governmental subdivision, including, but not
limited to, a comprehensive plan or land use plan that shows an intended future use of the land for
the authorized public use.
    (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue on or after January
1, 2007, may be acquired by that governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the
conveyance if the commissioner determines upon written application from the subdivision that the
subdivision has in fact put the property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed, and
the subdivision has made a finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Prior

to conveying the property, the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land
is located objects to a conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without
further act by or obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the
commissioner makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on
behalf of the state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For
purposes of this paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in
a formal plan of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.
    (c) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue before January
1, 2007, is released from the use restriction and possibility of reversion on January 1, 2022, if
the county board records a resolution describing the land and citing this paragraph. The county
board may authorize the county treasurer to deduct the amount of the recording fees from future
settlements of property taxes to the subdivision.
    (d) All property conveyed under a conditional use deed executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph
(e), by the commissioner of revenue is released from the use restriction and reverter, and any use
restriction or reverter for which no declaration of reversion has been recorded with the county
recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, is nullified on the later of: (1) January 1, 2015; (2)
30 years from the date the deed was acknowledged; or (3) final resolution of an appeal to district
court under subdivision 1e, if a lis pendens related to the appeal is recorded in the office of the
county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, prior to January 1, 2015.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1g. Conditional use deed fees. (a) A governmental subdivision of the state applying
for a conditional use deed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), must submit a fee of $250 to the
commissioner of revenue along with the application. If the application is denied, the commissioner
shall refund $150 of the application fee.
   (b) The proceeds from the fees must be deposited in a Department of Revenue conditional
use deed revolving fund. The sums deposited into the revolving fund are appropriated to the
commissioner of revenue for the purpose of making the refunds described in this subdivision, and
administering conditional use deed laws.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for applications received by the commissioner
after June 30, 2010.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

commissioner of revenue under subdivision 1a, paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h), and
subdivision 1d, paragraph (b), must be on a form approved by the attorney general and are prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein and that the execution and issuance of the conveyance
complies with the applicable laws.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for deeds executed by the commissioner of
revenue after June 30, 2010.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonconservation lands; appraisal and sale. (a) All parcels of land classified as
nonconservation, except those which may be reserved, shall be sold as provided, if it is determined,
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie, that it is advisable to do so, having in
mind their accessibility, their proximity to existing public improvements, and the effect of their
sale and occupancy on the public burdens. Any parcels of land proposed to be sold shall be first
appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
    (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall
submit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the first publication of the list of lands to be
offered for sale a list of all lands included on the list which are situated outside of any incorporated
municipality. If, at any time before the opening of the sale, the commissioner notifies the county
auditor in writing that there is standing timber on any parcel of ­    su

                                                                          ­ land, the parcel shall not be
sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
    (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until

the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                                  In

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only
(1) a payment of at least ten percent of the purchase price must be made at the time of purchase, and
the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber
or timber products must not be removed from these lands until an amount equal to the appraised
value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid
by the purchaser. If a parcel of land bearing standing timber or timber products is sold at public
auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the
excess bid allocated to timber or timber products has been paid in addition to the appraised value of
the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is
applicable. Interest on the unpaid contract balance on sales occurring before July 1, 1982, is payable
at the rate applicable to the sale at the time that the sale occurred.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
      Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:

shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are
sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as
provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.

    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. City sales; alternate procedures. Land located in a home rule charter or statutory
city, or in a town which cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local ordinances
regarding minimum area, shape, frontage or access may be sold by the county auditor pursuant to
this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics
of the land indicate that its highest and best use will be achieved by combining it with an adjoining
parcel and the city or town has not adopted a local ordinance governing minimum area, shape,
frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists
of an undivided interest in land or land and improvements, the property may also be sold to the
other owners under this subdivision. The sale of land pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject
to any conditions imposed by the county board pursuant to section 282.03. The governing body of
the city or town may recommend to the county board conditions to be imposed on the sale. The
county auditor may restrict the sale to owners of lands adjoining the land to be sold. The county
auditor shall conduct the sale by sealed bid or may select another means of sale. The land shall be
sold to the highest bidder ­ bu

value. All owners of land adjoining the land to be sold shall be given a written notice at least 30
days prior to the sale.
   This subdivision shall be liberally construed to encourage the sale and utilization of tax-forfeited
land, to eliminate nuisances and dangerous conditions and to increase compliance with land use
ordinances.

      Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Notice; public hearing for use change. If a governmental subdivision that acquired
a parcel for public use under this section later determines to change the use, it must hold a public
hearing on the proposed use change. The governmental subdivision must mail written notice of the
proposed use change and the public hearing to each owner of property that is within 400 feet of
the parcel at least ten days and no more than 60 days before it holds the hearing. The notice must
identify: (1) the parcel, (2) its current use, (3) the proposed use, (4) the date, time, and place of the
public hearing, and (5) where to submit written comments on the proposal and that the public is
invited to testify at the public hearing.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to a change in use of a
parcel acquired under section 282.01, whether acquired by the governmental subdivision before or

      Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.34, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority. (a) The commissioner may abate, reduce, or refund any penalty or
interest that is imposed by a law administered by the commissioner, or imposed by section 270.0725,
subdivision 1 or 2, as a result of the late payment of tax or late filing of a return, if the failure to
timely pay the tax or failure to timely file the return is due to reasonable cause, or if the taxpayer is
located in a presidentially declared disaster or in a presidentially declared state of emergency area
or in an area declared to be in a state of emergency by the governor under section 12.31.
   (b) The commissioner shall abate any part of a penalty or additional tax charge under section
289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4, attributable to erroneous advice given to the
taxpayer in writing by an employee of the department acting in an official capacity, if the advice:
      (1) was reasonably relied on and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer;
and
      (2) was not the result of failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information.

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.52, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Payment agreements. (a) When any portion of any tax payable to the commissioner
together with interest and penalty thereon, if any, has not been paid, the commissioner may extend
91ST DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                         9899

the time for payment for a further period. When the authority of this section is invoked, the extension
shall be evidenced by written agreement signed by the taxpayer and the commissioner, stating the
amount of the tax with penalty and interest, if any, and providing for the payment of the amount in
installments.
    (b) The agreement may contain a confession of judgment for the amount and for any unpaid
portion thereof. If the agreement contains a confession of judgment, the confession of judgment
must provide that the commissioner may enter judgment against the taxpayer in the district court of
the county of residence as shown upon the taxpayer's tax return for the unpaid portion of the amount
specified in the extension agreement.
    (c) The agreement shall provide that it can be terminated, after notice by the commissioner, if
information provided by the taxpayer prior to the agreement was inaccurate or incomplete, collection
of the tax covered by the agreement is in jeopardy, there is a subsequent change in the taxpayer's
financial condition, the taxpayer has failed to make a payment due under the agreement, or the
taxpayer has failed to pay any other tax or file a tax return coming due after the agreement.
    (d) The notice must be given at least 14 calendar days prior to termination, and shall advise the
taxpayer of the right to request a reconsideration from the commissioner of whether termination
is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. A request for reconsideration does not stay
collection action beyond the 14-day notice period. If the commissioner has reason to believe that
collection of the tax covered by the agreement is in jeopardy, the commissioner may proceed under
section 270C.36 and terminate the agreement without regard to the 14-day period.
    (e) The commissioner may accept other collateral the commissioner considers appropriate to
secure satisfaction of the tax liability. The principal sum specified in the agreement shall bear interest
at the rate specified in section 270C.40 on all unpaid portions thereof until the same has been fully
paid or the unpaid portion thereof has been entered as a judgment. The judgment shall bear interest
at the rate specified in section 270C.40.
    (f) If it appears to the commissioner that the tax reported by the taxpayer is in excess of the
amount actually owing by the taxpayer, the extension agreement or the judgment entered pursuant
thereto shall be corrected. If after making the extension agreement or entering judgment with respect
thereto, the commissioner determines that the tax as reported by the taxpayer is less than the amount
actually due, the commissioner shall assess a further tax in accordance with the provisions of law
applicable to the tax.
   (g) The authority granted to the commissioner by this section is in addition to any other authority
granted to the commissioner by law to extend the time of payment or the time for filing a return and
shall not be construed in limitation thereof.
    (h) The commissioner shall charge a fee for entering into payment agreements that reflects
the commissioner's costs for entering into payment agreements. The fee is initially set at $25 and
is adjusted annually as necessary. The fee is charged for entering into a payment agreement, for
entering into a new payment agreement after the taxpayer has defaulted on a prior agreement, and
for entering into a new payment agreement as a result of renegotiation of the terms of an existing
agreement. The fee is paid to the commissioner before the payment agreement becomes effective
and does not reduce the amount of the liability.
   By June 1 of each year, the commissioner shall determine the cost to the commissioner for
9900                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [91ST DAY

entering into payment agreements during the fiscal year and adjust the payment agreement fee as
necessary to most nearly equal those costs. Determination of the fee for payment agreements under
this section is not subject to the fee setting requirements of section 16A.1283.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for payment agreements entered into or
renegotiated after June 30, 2010.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATION.
   $3,200,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of management and
budget for transfer to the cash flow account established under Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.152."

   Senator Cohen from the Committee on Finance, to which was referred
    H.F. No. 2899: A bill for an act relating to data practices; providing an administrative remedy
for certain data practices law violations; providing civil penalties; appropriating money; amending
Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 13.072, subdivision 2; 13.08, subdivision 4; proposing coding
for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 13.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.072, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Effect. Opinions issued by the commissioner under this section are not binding on the
government entity or members of a body subject to chapter 13D whose data or performance of duties
is the subject of the opinion, but an opinion described in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), must be given
deference by a court or other tribunal in a proceeding involving the data. The commissioner shall
arrange for public dissemination of opinions issued under this section. This section does not preclude
a person from bringing any other action under this chapter or other law in addition to or instead of
requesting a written opinion. A government entity, members of a body subject to chapter 13D, or
person that acts in conformity with a written opinion of the commissioner issued to the government
entity, members, or person or to another party is not liable for compensatory or exemplary damages
or awards of attorneys fees in actions for violations arising under section 13.08 or 13.085, or for a
penalty under section 13.09 or for fines, awards of attorney fees, or any other penalty under chapter
13D. A member of a body subject to chapter 13D is not subject to forfeiture of office if the member
was acting in reliance on an opinion.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.08, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Action to compel compliance. (a) Actions to compel compliance may be brought
either under this subdivision or section 13.085. For actions under this subdivision, in addition to the
remedies provided in subdivisions 1 to 3 or any other law, any aggrieved person seeking to enforce
the person's rights under this chapter or obtain access to data may bring an action in district court to
compel compliance with this chapter and may recover costs and disbursements, including reasonable
attorney's fees, as determined by the court. If the court determines that an action brought under this
subdivision is frivolous and without merit and a basis in fact, it may award reasonable costs and
attorney fees to the responsible authority. If the court issues an order to compel compliance under
this subdivision, the court may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 against the government entity.
This penalty is payable to the state general fund and is in addition to damages under subdivision 1.
The matter shall be heard as soon as possible. In an action involving a request for government data
9902                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

under section 13.03 or 13.04, the court may inspect in camera the government data in dispute, but
shall conduct its hearing in public and in a manner that protects the security of data classified as
not public. If the court issues an order to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court shall
forward a copy of the order to the commissioner of administration.
    (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty under this subdivision, the court or other
tribunal shall consider whether the government entity has substantially complied with general data
practices under this chapter, including but not limited to, whether the government entity has:
   (1) designated a responsible authority under section 13.02, subdivision 16;
   (2) designated a data practices compliance official under section 13.05, subdivision 13;
   (3) prepared the public document that names the responsible authority and describes the
records and data on individuals that are maintained by the government entity under section 13.05,
subdivision 1;
    (4) developed public access procedures under section 13.03, subdivision 2; procedures to
guarantee the rights of data subjects under section 13.05, subdivision 8; and procedures to ensure
that data on individuals are accurate and complete and to safeguard the data's security under section
13.05, subdivision 5;
   (5) acted in conformity with an opinion issued under section 13.072 that was sought by a
government entity or another person; or
    (6) provided ongoing training to government entity personnel who respond to requests under
this chapter.
    (c) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff who has brought an
action under this subdivision if the government entity that is the defendant in the action was also
the subject of a written opinion issued under section 13.072 and the court finds that the opinion is
directly related to the cause of action being litigated and that the government entity did not act in
conformity with the opinion.
   Sec. 3. [13.085] ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. As used in this section, "office" means the Office of Administrative
Hearings.
    Subd. 2. Complaints. (a) A complaint alleging a violation of this chapter for which an order to
compel compliance is requested may be filed with the office. An action to compel compliance does
not include procedures pursuant to section 13.04, subdivision 4 or 4a. An action may not be filed
under this section in matters involving requests for educational data classified under section 13.32.
    (b) The complaint must be filed with the office within two years after the occurrence of the act
or failure to act that is the subject of the complaint, except that if the act or failure to act involves
concealment or misrepresentation by the government entity that could not be discovered during
that period, the complaint may be filed with the office within one year after the concealment or
misrepresentation is discovered.
    (c) The complaint must be made in writing, submitted under oath, and detail the factual basis
for the claim that a violation of law has occurred. The office may prescribe a standard form for the
91ST DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 2010                                        9903

complaint. The complaint must be accompanied by a filing fee of $1,000 or a bond to guarantee the
payment of this fee.
    (d) Upon receipt of a filed complaint, the office must immediately notify the respondent and, if
known, the applicable responsible authority for the government entity, if the responsible authority
is not otherwise named as the respondent. The office must provide the respondent with a copy of
the complaint by the most expeditious means available. Notice to a responsible authority must be
delivered by certified mail. The office must also notify, to the extent practicable, any individual or
entity that is the subject of all or part of the data in dispute.
    (e) The office must notify the commissioner of administration of an action filed under this
section. Proceedings under this section must be dismissed if a request for an opinion from the
commissioner was accepted on the matter under section 13.072 before the complaint was filed, and
the complainant's filing fee must be refunded.
    (f) The respondent must file a response to the complaint within 15 business days of receipt of
the notice. For good cause shown, the office may extend the time for filing a response.
     Subd. 3. Probable cause review. (a) The chief administrative law judge must assign an
administrative law judge to review each complaint. Within 20 business days after a response
is filed, or the respondent's time to file the response, including any extension, has expired, the
administrative law judge must make a preliminary determination for its disposition as follows:
    (1) if the administrative law judge determines that the complaint and any timely response of
the respondent agency do not present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has
occurred, the complaint must be dismissed; or
    (2) if the administrative law judge determines that the complaint and any timely response of the
respondent agency do present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has occurred,
the judge must schedule a hearing as provided in subdivision 4.
  (b) The office must notify all parties of the determination made under paragraph (a). The notice
must provide as follows:
    (1) if the complaint is scheduled for a hearing, the notice must identify the time and place of
the hearing and inform all parties that they may submit evidence, affidavits, documentation, and
argument for consideration by the administrative law judge; or
    (2) if the complaint is dismissed for failure to present sufficient facts to believe that a violation
of this chapter has occurred, the notice must inform the parties of the right of the complainant to
seek reconsideration of the decision on the record by the chief administrative law judge, as provided
in paragraph (c).
    (c) A petition for reconsideration may be filed no later than five business days after a complaint
is dismissed for failure to present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has
occurred. The chief administrative law judge must review the petition and make a final ruling
within ten business days after its receipt. If the chief administrative law judge determines that the
assigned administrative law judge made a clear material error, the chief administrative law judge
must schedule the matter for a hearing as provided in subdivision 4.
   Subd. 4. Hearing; procedure. (a) A hearing on a complaint must be held within 30 business
9904                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

days after the parties are notified that a hearing will be held. An oral hearing to resolve questions
of law may be waived upon consent of all parties and the presiding administrative law judge. For
good cause shown, the judge may delay the date of a hearing by no more than ten business days.
The judge may continue a hearing to enable the parties to submit additional evidence or testimony.
   (b) The administrative law judge must consider any evidence and argument submitted until the
hearing record is closed, including affidavits and documentation.
    (c) All hearings, and any records relating to the hearing, must be open to the public, except
that the judge may inspect in camera any government data in dispute. If the hearing record
contains information that is not public data, the judge may conduct a closed hearing to consider
the information, issue necessary protective orders, and seal all or part of the hearing record, as
provided in section 14.60, subdivision 2. If a party contends, and the judge concludes, that not
public data could be improperly disclosed while that party is presenting its arguments, the judge
shall close any portion of the hearing as necessary to prevent the disclosure. A hearing may be
conducted by conference telephone call or interactive audio/video system, at the discretion of the
presiding judge, and upon consent of all parties.
    Subd. 5. Disposition. (a) Following a hearing, the judge must determine whether the violation
alleged in the complaint occurred and must make at least one of the following dispositions. The
judge may:
   (1) dismiss the complaint;
   (2) find that an act or failure to act constituted a violation of this chapter;
   (3) impose a civil penalty against the respondent of up to $300;
    (4) issue an order compelling the respondent to comply with a provision of law that has been
violated, and may establish a deadline for production of data, if necessary; and

purposes of harassment, the judge must order that the complainant pay the respondent's reasonable
attorney fees, not to exceed $5,000. The complainant shall not be entitled to a refund of the filing
fee.

    (6) a field collection site test to demonstrate mastery of the necessary skills, overseen by a
certified fish health inspector; and
   (7) a certificate of successful completion signed by a certified fish health inspector on a form
provided by the commissioner.
    Subd. 2. Certification time period. Fish collector certification is valid for five years and is
not transferable. A person may renew certification only by successfully completing certification
training. Certification shall be revoked if the certified person is convicted of violating any of the
statutes or rules governing testing for aquatic species diseases. Certification may be suspended
during an investigation associated with misconduct or violations of fish health testing and collection.
The commissioner shall notify the person that certification is being revoked or suspended.
    Subd. 3. Conflict of interest. A fish collector may not oversee the collection of fish from a
facility or a water body when the collector has a conflict of interest in connection with the outcome
of the testing.

    (b) An aquatic farm propagating any species on the viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS)
susceptible list and having an effluent discharge from the aquatic farm into public waters must
test for VHS virus using the guidelines of the Fish Health Blue Book or the Diagnostic Manual
for Aquatic Animal Diseases, published by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The
commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, prescribe alternative testing
time periods and methods from those prescribed in the Fish Health Blue Book or the OIE Diagnostic
Manual if the commissioner determines that biosecurity measures will not be compromised. These
alternatives are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does
not apply. The commissioner must provide reasonable notice to affected parties of any changes in
testing requirements.

    (c) Results of fish health inspections must be provided to the commissioner for all fish that remain
in the state. All data used to prepare and issue a fish health certificate must be maintained for three
years by the issuing fish health inspector, approved laboratory, or accredited veterinarian.
    (d) A health inspection fee must be charged based on each lot of fish sampled. The fee by check
or money order payable to the Department of Natural Resources must be prepaid or paid at the time
a bill or notice is received from the commissioner that the inspection and processing of samples is
completed.

     ­­) (f) All aquatic life in transit or held at transfer stations within the state may be inspected by
the commissioner. This inspection may include the collection of stock for purposes of pathological
analysis. Sample size necessary for analysis will follow guidelines listed in the Fish Health Blue
Book.

      ) (g) Salmonids and catfish must have a fish health inspection before being transported from
a containment facility, unless the fish are being transported directly to an outlet for processing or
other food purposes or unless the commissioner determines that an inspection is not needed. A fish
health inspection conducted for this purpose need only be done on the lot or lots of fish that will
be transported. The commissioner must conduct a fish health inspection requested for this purpose
within five working days of receiving written notice. Salmonids and catfish may be immediately
transported from a containment facility to another containment facility once a sample has been
obtained for a health inspection or once the five-day notice period has expired.

29. T ­h­­ e Taking o     ­­f sucker eggs from public waters is subject to chapter 97C and may be supervised
by the commissioner. The commissioner may limit the amount of sucker eggs that a person with
a sucker egg license endorsement may take based on the number of sucker eggs taken historically
by the licensee, new requests for eggs, and the condition of the spawning runs at those historical
streams and rivers that have produced previous annual quotas.

paragraphs (d) and (f), every person owning or controlling any domestic animal that has died or
been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption, shall as soon
as reasonably possible bury the carcass at a depth adequate to prevent scavenging by other animals
in the ground or thoroughly burn it or dispose of it by another method approved by the board as
being effective for the protection of public health and the control of livestock diseases. The board,
through its executive director, may issue permits to owners of rendering plants located in Minnesota

which are operated and conducted as required by law, to transport carcasses of domestic animals and
fowl that have died, or have been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal
consumption, over the public highways to their plants for rendering purposes in accordance with
the rules adopted by the board relative to transportation, rendering, and other provisions the board
considers necessary to prevent the spread of disease. The board may issue permits to owners of
rendering plants located in an adjacent state with which a reciprocal agreement is in effect under
subdivision 3.
     (b) Carcasses collected by rendering plants under permit may be used for pet food or mink food
if the owner or operator meets the requirements of subdivision 1b.
    (c) An authorized employee or agent of the board may enter private or public property and inspect
the carcass of any domestic animal that has died or has been killed other than by being slaughtered
for human or animal consumption. Failure to dispose of the carcass of any domestic animal within
the period specified by this subdivision is a public nuisance. The board may petition the district court
of the county in which a carcass is located for a writ requiring the abatement of the public nuisance.
A civil action commenced under this paragraph does not preclude a criminal prosecution under this
section. No person may sell, offer to sell, give away, or convey along a public road or on land the
person does not own, the carcass of a domestic animal when the animal died or was killed other
than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption unless it is done with a special permit
pursuant to this section. The carcass or parts of a domestic animal that has died or has been killed
other than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption may be transported along a public
road for a medical or scientific purpose if the carcass is enclosed in a leakproof container to prevent
spillage or the dripping of liquid waste. The board may adopt rules relative to the transportation
of the carcass of any domestic animal for a medical or scientific purpose. A carcass on a public
thoroughfare may be transported for burial or other disposition in accordance with this section.
   No person who owns or controls diseased animals shall negligently or willfully permit them to
escape from that control or to run at large.
   (d) A sheep producer may compost sheep carcasses owned by the producer on the producer's
land without a permit and is exempt from compost facility specifications contained in rules of the
board.
   (e) The board shall develop best management practices for dead animal disposal and the
Pollution Control Agency feedlot program shall distribute them to livestock producers in the state.
    (f) Paragraph (a) does not apply to livestock killed by wild animals or domestic dogs and the
carcass is out-of-sight of the public, and will be used to attract the offending predators back to the
kill site.

has successfully completed basic training in the United States armed forces is exempt from the
range and shooting exercise portion of the required course of instruction for the hunter education

training, as deemed appropriate for implementing this subdivision. The commissioner shall publicly

exam portion of the course because of developmental disability as defined in section 97B.1055,
subdivision 1. The certificate is valid only when used according to section 97B.1055.
    Subd. 7. Fee for duplicate certificate. The commissioner shall collect a fee, to include a $1
issuing fee for licensing agents, for issuing a duplicate hunter education firearms safety certificate.
The commissioner shall establish a fee that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers
costs, including overhead costs, involved in providing the service. The fee is not subject to the
rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The commissioner may
establish the fee notwithstanding section 16A.1283. The duplicate certificate fees, except for the
issuing fee for licensing agents under this subdivision, shall be deposited in the game and fish fund
and, except for the electronic licensing system commission established by the commissioner under
section 84.027, subdivision 15, and issuing fees collected by the commissioner, are appropriated
annually to the Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources for the administration
of the hunter education firearm safety course program.

1979, chapter 199, to reclassify those types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands previously identified as public waters
wetlands under Laws 1979, chapter 199, as public waters or as wetlands under section 103G.005,
subdivision 19. The commissioner may only reclassify public waters wetlands as public waters if:
   (1) they are assigned a shoreland management classification by the commissioner under sections
103F.201 to 103F.221;
   (2) they are classified as lacustrine wetlands or deepwater habitats according to Classification of
Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (Cowardin, et al., 1979 edition); or
    (3) the state or federal government has become titleholder to any of the beds or shores of the
public waters wetlands, subsequent to the preparation of the public waters inventory map filed with
the auditor of the county, pursuant to paragraph (a), and the responsible state or federal agency
declares that the water is necessary for the purposes of the public ownership.
    (c) The commissioner must provide notice of the reclassification to the local government unit,
the county board, the watershed district, if one exists for the area, and the soil and water conservation
district. Within 60 days of receiving notice from the commissioner, a party required to receive
the notice may provide a resolution stating objections to the reclassification. If the commissioner
receives an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the reclassification is not effective.
If the commissioner does not receive an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the
reclassification of a wetland under paragraph (b) is effective 60 days after the notice is received by
all of the parties.
    (d) The commissioner shall give priority to the reclassification of public waters wetlands that
are or have the potential to be affected by public works projects.
   (e) The commissioner may revise the public waters inventory map ­

APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Monitoring equipment. The commissioner may require the installation
and maintenance of monitoring equipment to evaluate water resource impacts from permitted
appropriations and proposed projects that require a permit. Monitoring for water resources that
supply more than one appropriator must be designed to minimize costs to individual appropriators.
    Subd. 2. Measuring devices required. Monitoring installations required under subdivision 1
must be equipped with automated measuring devices to measure water levels, flows, or conditions.
The commissioner may determine the frequency of measurements and other measuring methods
based on the quantity of water appropriated or used, the source of water, potential connections to
other water resources, the method of appropriating or using water, seasonal and long-term changes
in water levels, and any other facts supplied to the commissioner.
   Subd. 3. Reports and costs. (a) Records of water measurements under subdivision 2 must be
kept for each installation. The measurements must be reported annually to the commissioner on or
before February 15 of the following year in a format or on forms prescribed by the commissioner.
    (b) The owner or person in charge of an installation for appropriating or using waters of the state
or a proposal that requires a permit is responsible for all costs related to establishing and maintaining
monitoring installations and to measuring and reporting data. Monitoring costs for water resources
that supply more than one appropriator may be distributed among all users within a monitoring
area determined by the commissioner and assessed based on volumes of water appropriated and
proximity to resources of concern.

   Sec. 27. [103G.287] GROUNDWATER APPROPRIATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Waiver. The commissioner may waive a limitation or requirement in subdivisions
2 to 6 for just cause.
    Subd. 2. Applications for groundwater appropriations. Groundwater use permit applications
are not complete until the applicant has supplied:
    (1) a water well record as required by section 103I.205, subdivision 9, information on the
subsurface geologic formations penetrated by the well and the formation or aquifer that will serve
as the water source, and geologic information from test holes drilled to locate the site of the
production well;
   (2) the maximum daily, seasonal, and annual pumpage rates and volumes being requested;
    (3) information on groundwater quality in terms of the measures of quality commonly specified
for the proposed water use and details on water treatment necessary for the proposed use;
    (4) an inventory of existing wells within 1-1/2 miles of the proposed production well or within
the area of influence, as determined by the commissioner. The inventory must include information on
well locations, depths, geologic formations, depth of the pump or intake, pumping and nonpumping
water levels, and details of well construction; and
   (5) the results of an aquifer test completed according to specifications approved by the
commissioner. The test must be conducted at the maximum pumping rate requested in the
application and for a length of time adequate to assess or predict impacts to other wells and surface
water and groundwater resources. The permit applicant is responsible for all costs related to the
aquifer test, including the construction of groundwater and surface water monitoring installations,
and water level readings before, during, and after the aquifer test.
   Subd. 3. Relationship to surface water resources. Groundwater appropriations that have
potential impacts to surface waters are subject to applicable provisions in section 103G.285.
   Subd. 4. Protection of groundwater supplies. The commissioner may establish water
appropriation limits to protect groundwater resources. When establishing water appropriation
limits to protect groundwater resources, the commissioner must consider current and projected
water levels and water supply management objectives in section 103G.265, subdivision 1.
   Subd. 5. Groundwater management areas. The commissioner may designate groundwater
management areas and limit total annual water appropriations and uses within a designated area to
ensure future supplies. Water appropriations and uses within a designated management area must be
consistent with a plan approved by the commissioner that addresses water conservation requirements
and water allocation priorities established in section 103G.261.
    Subd. 6. Interference with other wells. The commissioner may issue water use permits for
appropriation from groundwater only if the commissioner determines that adequate water supplies
are available for the proposed use without reducing water levels beyond the reach of public water
supply and private domestic wells constructed according to Minnesota Rules, chapter 4725.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103G.301, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

    The state pledges and agrees with all contributors to the nongame wildlife management account
to use the funds contributed solely for the management of nongame wildlife projects and further
agrees that it will not impose additional conditions or restrictions that will limit or otherwise restrict
the ability of the commissioner of natural resources to use the available funds for the most efficient
and effective management of nongame wildlife. The commissioner may use funds appropriated for
nongame wildlife programs for the purpose of developing, preserving, restoring, and maintaining
wintering habitat for neotropical migrant birds in Latin America and the Caribbean under agreement
or contract with any nonprofit organization dedicated to the construction, maintenance, and repair of
such projects that are acceptable to the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the land and
water affected by the projects. Under this authority, the commissioner may execute agreements and
contracts if the commissioner determines that the use of the funds will benefit neotropical migrant
birds that breed in or migrate through the state.

policy committees with recommendations for changes to this subdivision that are necessary for the
stream easement payment rates to reflect current shoreland market values. The recommendations
