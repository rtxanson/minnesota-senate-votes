   "Section 1. [136F.302] CREDIT TRANSFER.
    The Board of Trustees must develop and maintain a systemwide effective and efficient
mechanism for seamless student transfer between system institutions that has a goal of minimal
loss of credits for transferring students. The Degree Audit and Reporting System (DARS) and
u.select database (and successor databases) housed within the office of the chancellor shall be
the official repository of course equivalencies between system colleges and universities. Each
system college and university shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of
course equivalencies listed for courses offered by that college or university. The development and
maintenance of the system must, at a minimum, address the following:
   (1) alignment of institution curriculum and its communication to stakeholders;
   (2) transfer between similar programs;
   (3) documentation for transfer-related agreements between institutions;
    (4) systemwide transfer information on the Internet that is easily accessible and maintained in
a current and accurate status. Each system college and university shall post information necessary
to determine the transferability of course credits on their institutional Web sites. The office of the
chancellor must develop, in consultation with faculty and students, a template to be used by the
colleges and universities to ensure consistency in the information available to students. The links
to each institution's informational Web site shall be submitted to the office of the chancellor for

publication on the MinnesotaTransfer.org Web site;
   (5) training for campus-level staff to provide accurate and consistent advice to students;
   (6) institutional rather than student obligation to provide prompt required documentation for
course equivalency determinations; and
   (7) consistency of transfer policies among institutions in compliance with a system policy.
   Sec. 2. REPORT OF CREDIT TRANSFER ACTIVITIES.
    The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities shall report on February
15, 2011, and annually thereafter through 2015, on its activities to achieve the credit transfer goals
of Minnesota Statutes, section 136F.302, and the results of those activities. The report shall be made
to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with primary jurisdiction
over higher education policy and finance. The goals of Minnesota Statutes, section 136F.302, should
be fully achieved as soon as possible, but no later than the start of the 2015-2016 academic year."
