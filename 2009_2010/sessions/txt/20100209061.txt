    (b) For subdivisions 3 and 4, the first phase must focus on adults in Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties and children statewide who are affected by section 256B.0625, subdivision 13j, and must
include tracking of costs for the services provided and associated impacts on utilization of inpatient,
emergency room, and other services.
    Subd. 6. Limited appropriations. The commissioner shall maximize use of available health care
coverage for the services provided under this section. The commissioner's responsibility to provide
these services for individuals without health care coverage must not exceed the appropriations for

of the full value of the rebasing percentage change. Effective April 1, 2012, rates shall be rebased at
full value. The base year operating payment rate per admission is standardized by the case mix index
and adjusted by the hospital cost index, relative values, and disproportionate population adjustment.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to
read:
  Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay

over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.

of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2006, to
reflect this reduction.

   (3) the drug is part of the recipient's current course of treatment.
This paragraph applies to any multistate preferred drug list or supplemental drug rebate program
established or administered by the commissioner. Prior authorization shall automatically be granted
for 60 days for brand name drugs prescribed for treatment of mental illness within 60 days of when
a generically equivalent drug becomes available, provided that the brand name drug was part of the
recipient's course of treatment at the time the generically equivalent drug became available.
   (d) Prior authorization shall not be required or utilized for any antihemophilic factor drug
prescribed for the treatment of hemophilia and blood disorders where there is no generically
equivalent drug available if the prior authorization is used in conjunction with any supplemental
drug rebate program or multistate preferred drug list established or administered by the
commissioner.
    (e) The commissioner may require prior authorization for brand name drugs whenever a
generically equivalent product is available, even if the prescriber specifically indicates "dispense
as written-brand necessary" on the prescription as required by section 151.21, subdivision 2.
    (f) Notwithstanding this subdivision, the commissioner may automatically require prior
authorization, for a period not to exceed 180 days, for any drug that is approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration on or after July 1, 2005. The 180-day period begins no
later than the first day that a drug is available for shipment to pharmacies within the state. The
Formulary Committee shall recommend to the commissioner general criteria to be used for the
prior authorization of the drugs, but the committee is not required to review each individual drug.
In order to continue prior authorizations for a drug after the 180-day period has expired, the
commissioner must follow the provisions of this subdivision.

disorder medications. (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the Drug Utilization Review
Board established in subdivision 13i and actively practicing pediatric mental health professionals,
6878                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [61ST DAY

must:
    (1) identify recommended pediatric dose ranges for atypical antipsychotic drugs and drugs
used for attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on available
medical, clinical, and safety data and research. The commissioner shall periodically review the list
of medications and pediatric dose ranges and update the medications and doses listed as needed
after consultation with the Drug Utilization Review Board;
    (2) identify situations where a collaborative psychiatric consultation and prior authorization
should be required before the initiation or continuation of drug therapy in pediatric patients
including, but not limited to, high-dose regimens, off-label use of prescription medication, a
patient's young age, and lack of coordination among multiple prescribing providers; and
    (3) track prescriptive practices and the use of psychotropic medications in children with the goal
of reducing the use of medication, where appropriate.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2011, the commissioner shall require prior authorization and a collaborative
psychiatric consultation before an atypical antipsychotic and attention deficit disorder and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder medication meeting the criteria identified in paragraph (a), clause
(2), is eligible for payment. A collaborative psychiatric consultation must be completed before the
identified medications are eligible for payment unless:
   (1) the patient has already been stabilized on the medication regimen; or
   (2) the prescriber indicates that the child is in crisis.
If clause (1) or (2) applies, the collaborative psychiatric consultation must be completed within 90
days for payment to continue.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, a collaborative psychiatric consultation must meet the
criteria described in section 245.4862, subdivision 4.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.195, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 3. Payments to certain safety net providers. (a) Effective July 15, 2001, the
commissioner shall make the following payments to the hospitals indicated annually:
    (1) to Hennepin County Medical Center, any federal matching funds available to match the
payments received by the medical center under subdivision 2, to increase payments for medical
assistance admissions and to recognize higher medical assistance costs in institutions that provide
high levels of charity care; and
    (2) to Regions Hospital, any federal matching funds available to match the payments received
by the hospital under subdivision 2, to increase payments for medical assistance admissions and to
recognize higher medical assistance costs in institutions that provide high levels of charity care.
    (b) Effective July 15, 2001, the following percentages of the transfers under subdivision 2 shall
be retained by the commissioner for deposit each month into the general fund:
   (1) 18 percent, plus any federal matching funds, shall be allocated for the following purposes:

    (i) during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001, of the amount available under this clause, 39.7
percent shall be allocated to make increased hospital payments under section 256.969, subdivision
26; 34.2 percent shall be allocated to fund the amounts due from small rural hospitals, as defined
in section 144.148, for overpayments under section 256.969, subdivision 5a, resulting from a
determination that medical assistance and general assistance payments exceeded the charge limit
during the period from 1994 to 1997; and 26.1 percent shall be allocated to the commissioner of
health for rural hospital capital improvement grants under section 144.148; and
    (ii) during fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2002, of the amount available under this
clause, 55 percent shall be allocated to make increased hospital payments under section 256.969,
subdivision 26, and 45 percent shall be allocated to the commissioner of health for rural hospital
capital improvement grants under section 144.148; and
   (2) 11 percent shall be allocated to the commissioner of health to fund community clinic grants
under section 145.9268.
     (c) This subdivision shall apply to fee-for-service payments only and shall not increase capitation
payments or payments made based on average rates. The allocation in paragraph (b), clause (1), item
(ii), to increase hospital payments under section 256.969, subdivision 26, shall not limit payments
under that section.
    (d) Medical assistance rate or payment changes, including those required to obtain federal
financial participation under section 62J.692, subdivision 8, shall precede the determination
of intergovernmental transfer amounts determined in this subdivision. Participation in the
intergovernmental transfer program shall not result in the offset of any health care provider's
receipt of medical assistance payment increases other than limits resulting from hospital-specific
charge limits and limits on disproportionate share hospital payments.
    (e) Effective July 1, 2003, if the amount available for allocation under paragraph (b) is greater
than the amounts available during March 2003, after any increase in intergovernmental transfers
and payments that result from section 256.969, subdivision 3a, paragraph (c), are paid to the
general fund, any additional amounts available under this subdivision after reimbursement of the
transfers under subdivision 2 shall be allocated to increase medical assistance payments, subject to
hospital-specific charge limits and limits on disproportionate share hospital payments, as follows:
    (1) if the payments under subdivision 5 are approved, the amount shall be paid to the largest
ten percent of hospitals as measured by 2001 payments for medical assistance, general assistance
medical care, and MinnesotaCare in the nonstate government hospital category. Payments shall be
allocated according to each hospital's proportionate share of the 2001 payments; or
    (2) if the payments under subdivision 5 are not approved, the amount shall be paid to the largest
ten percent of hospitals as measured by 2001 payments for medical assistance, general assistance
medical care, and MinnesotaCare in the nonstate government category and to the largest ten percent
of hospitals as measured by payments for medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and
MinnesotaCare in the nongovernment hospital category. Payments shall be allocated according to
each hospital's proportionate share of the 2001 payments in their respective category of nonstate
government and nongovernment. The commissioner shall determine which hospitals are in the
nonstate government and nongovernment hospital categories.
   (f) For federal fiscal years 2010 and 2011, payments under this subdivision shall be made at no

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.196, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Commissioner's duties. (a) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3,
the commissioner shall determine the fee-for-service outpatient hospital services upper payment
limit for nonstate government hospitals. The commissioner shall then determine the amount of
a supplemental payment to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital for these
services that would increase medical assistance spending in this category to the aggregate upper
payment limit for all nonstate government hospitals in Minnesota. In making this determination,
the commissioner shall allot the available increases between Hennepin County Medical Center
and Regions Hospital based on the ratio of medical assistance fee-for-service outpatient hospital
payments to the two facilities. The commissioner shall adjust this allotment as necessary based on
federal approvals, the amount of intergovernmental transfers received from Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties, and other factors, in order to maximize the additional total payments. The commissioner
shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic intergovernmental transfers
necessary to match federal Medicaid payments available under this subdivision in order to make
supplementary medical assistance payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions
Hospital equal to an amount that when combined with existing medical assistance payments
to nonstate governmental hospitals would increase total payments to hospitals in this category
for outpatient services to the aggregate upper payment limit for all hospitals in this category in
Minnesota. Upon receipt of these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary
payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3, the commissioner shall determine
an upper payment limit for physicians affiliated with Hennepin County Medical Center and
with Regions Hospital. The upper payment limit shall be based on the average commercial rate
or be determined using another method acceptable to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic
intergovernmental transfers necessary to match the federal Medicaid payments available under
this subdivision in order to make supplementary payments to physicians affiliated with Hennepin
County Medical Center and Regions Hospital equal to the difference between the established
medical assistance payment for physician services and the upper payment limit. Upon receipt of
these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary payments to physicians of
Hennepin Faculty Associates and HealthPartners.

Regions Hospital by the same amount as the increased payments received in the capitation payment
described in this paragraph.

the need for any changes needed in the intergovernmental transfers in order to continue the payments
under paragraphs (a) to (c), at their maximum level, including increases in upper payment limits,

certified public expenditures under paragraph (b), clause (1), shall report additional certified public
expenditures as necessary under this paragraph.
   (e) Effective July 15, 2010, in addition to any payment otherwise required under sections
256B.19, 256B.195, and 256B.196, the following government entities may make the following

Act regarding increased local share.
    (k) This section shall be implemented upon federal approval of the rate increase and a federal

Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The applicant
must complete the application within the time periods required under the medical assistance
program as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0015, subpart 5, and 9505.0090, subpart 2.
The county agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (j) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (k) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (l) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
     (m) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (n) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,

undocumented noncitizen is an individual who resides in the United States without the approval or

    (p) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (q) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.

    Subd. 3a. Claims; assignment of benefits. (a) Claims must be filed pursuant to section
256D.16. General assistance medical care applicants and recipients must apply or agree to apply
third party health and accident benefits to the costs of medical care. They must cooperate with the
state in establishing paternity and obtaining third party payments. By accepting general assistance,
a person assigns to the Department of Human Services all rights to medical support or payments
for medical expenses from another person or entity on their own or their dependent's behalf and
agrees to cooperate with the state in establishing paternity and obtaining third party payments. The
application shall contain a statement explaining the assignment. Any rights or amounts assigned
shall be applied against the cost of medical care paid for under this chapter. An assignment is
effective on the date general assistance medical care eligibility takes effect.
    (b) Effective for general assistance medical care services rendered on or after March 1, 2010,
to June 30, 2011, any medical collections, payments, or recoveries under this subdivision shall be

    Subd. 3b. Cooperation. (a) General assistance or general assistance medical care applicants and
recipients must cooperate with the state and local agency to identify potentially liable third-party
payors and assist the state in obtaining third-party payments. Cooperation includes identifying any
third party who may be liable for care and services provided under this chapter to the applicant,
recipient, or any other family member for whom application is made and providing relevant
information to assist the state in pursuing a potentially liable third party. General assistance medical
care applicants and recipients must cooperate by providing information about any group health
plan in which they may be eligible to enroll. They must cooperate with the state and local agency
in determining if the plan is cost-effective. For purposes of this subdivision, coverage provided
by the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association under chapter 62E shall not be considered
group health plan coverage or cost-effective by the state and local agency. If the plan is determined

cost-effective and the premium will be paid by the state or local agency or is available at no cost to
the person, they must enroll or remain enrolled in the group health plan. Cost-effective insurance
premiums approved for payment by the state agency and paid by the local agency are eligible for
reimbursement according to subdivision 6.
    (b) Effective for all premiums due on or after June 30, 1997, general assistance medical care does
not cover premiums that a recipient is required to pay under a qualified or Medicare supplement plan
issued by the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association. General assistance medical care shall
continue to cover premiums for recipients who are covered under a plan issued by the Minnesota
Comprehensive Health Association on June 30, 1997, for a period of six months following receipt
of the notice of termination or until December 31, 1997, whichever is later.
