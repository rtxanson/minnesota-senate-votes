4030                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [47TH DAY

The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 166 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 166 be further amended as follows:

47TH DAY]                              TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2009                                          4031

insurance policy, in return for the owner's assignment, transfer, sale, devise, or bequest of the death
benefit or ownership of any portion of the policy. Settlement contract also includes:
    (1) the transfer for compensation or value of ownership or beneficial interest in a trust or other
entity that owns such a policy if the trust or other entity was formed or availed of for the principal
purpose of acquiring one or more policies, which policy insures the life of an individual who is a
resident of this state; and
    (2) a premium finance loan made for a policy by a lender to a policyowner on, before, or after
the date of issuance of the policy where:
     (i) the policyowner or the insured receives a guarantee of a future settlement value of the policy;
or
   (ii) the policyowner or the insured agrees to sell the policy or any portion of its death benefit on
any date following the issuance of the policy.
     (b) Settlement contract does not include:
     (1) a policy loan or accelerated death benefit made by the insurer under the policy's terms;

including, without limitation, interest, arrangement fees, utilization fees and similar fees, closing
costs, legal fees and expenses, trustee fees and expenses, and third-party collateral provider fees
and expenses, including fees payable to letter of credit issuers;
    (3) a loan made by a bank or other licensed financial institution in which the lender takes an
interest in a policy solely to secure repayment of a loan or, if there is a default on the loan and
the policy is transferred, the transfer of such a policy by the lender, as long as the default itself is
not pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the purpose of evading
regulation under this act;
   (4) an agreement in which all the parties are closely related to the insured by blood or law or

4032                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [47TH DAY

and a service provider, or a trust established by the service provider, who performs significant
services for the service recipient's trade or business.
    Subd. 12. Stranger-originated life insurance practices. "Stranger-originated life insurance
practices" or "STOLI practices" mean an act, practice, or arrangement to initiate a life insurance
policy for the benefit of a third-party investor who, at the time of policy origination, has no insurable
interest in the insured. STOLI practices include, but are not limited to, cases in which life insurance is
purchased with resources or guarantees from or through a person or entity, who, at the time of policy
inception, could not lawfully initiate the policy themselves, and where, at the time of inception,
there is an arrangement or agreement, whether spoken or written, to directly or indirectly transfer
the ownership of the policy and/or the policy benefits to a third party. Trusts that are created to
give the appearance of insurable interest and are used to initiate policies for investors violate the
insurable interest requirements and the prohibition against STOLI practices.
   Sec. 3. [60A.0783] INSURABLE INTEREST REQUIRED.
    Subdivision 1. Insurance on life of another. A person may not procure or cause to be procured
or effected a policy upon the life of another individual unless the benefits under the policy are
payable to the insured, the personal representatives of the insured's estate, or to a person having, at
the time the policy is issued, an insurable interest in the individual insured.
    Subd. 2. What constitutes an insurable interest. Insurable interest, with reference to insurance
on the life of another, includes only the following interests.
    (a) An individual has an insurable interest in the life of another person to whom the individual is
closely related by blood or by law and in whom the individual has a substantial interest engendered
by love and affection.
    (b) An individual has an insurable interest in the life of another person if such individual has a
lawful and substantial interest in the continued life of the individual insured, as distinguished from
an interest that would arise only by or would be enhanced in value by the death of the individual
insured.
    (c) An individual party to a contract for the purchase or sale of an interest in any business entity
and, if applicable, a trust or the trustee of a trust of which the individual is a settlor, has an insurable
interest in the life of each other individual party to the contract, but only for the purpose of carrying
out the intent and purpose of the contract.
    (d) A trust, or the trustee of a trust, has an insurable interest in the life of an individual insured
under a life insurance policy owned by the trust, or the trustee of the trust acting in a fiduciary
capacity, if the insured is the settlor of the trust; an individual closely related by blood or law to
the settlor; or an individual in whom the settlor otherwise has an insurable interest if, in each of
the situations described in this paragraph, the life insurance proceeds are primarily for the benefit
of trust beneficiaries having an insurable interest in the life of the insured and the trust is not used,
directly or indirectly, as part of or in furtherance of an act, practice, or arrangement that is otherwise
prohibited by this act.
    (e) A guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary, acting in a fiduciary capacity, has an insurable interest
in the life of any person for whose benefit the fiduciary holds property, and in the life of any other
individual in whose life the person has an insurable interest so long as the life insurance proceeds are
47TH DAY]                             TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2009                                          4033

used primarily for the benefit of persons having an insurable interest in the life of the insured and the
guardianship or fiduciary relationship is not used, directly or indirectly, as part of or in furtherance
of an act, practice, or arrangement that is otherwise prohibited by this act.
    (f) An organization in section 170(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended through December 31, 2008, has an insurable interest in the life of any person who consents
in writing to the organization's ownership or purchase of that insurance.
    (g) A trustee, sponsor, or custodian of assets held in any plan governed by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, United States Code, title 29, section 1001, et seq., or in
any other retirement or employee benefit plan, has an insurable interest in the life of any participant
in the plan provided consent is obtained in writing from the participant before the insurance is
purchased. An employer, trustee, sponsor, or custodian may not retaliate or take adverse action
against any participant who does not consent to the issuance of insurance on the participant's life.
    (h) A business entity has an insurable interest in the life of any of the owners, directors, officers,
partners, and managers of the business entity or any affiliate or subsidiary of the business entity, or
key employees or key persons of the business entity or affiliate or subsidiary, provided consent is
obtained in writing from key employees or persons before the insurance is purchased. The business
entity or affiliate or subsidiary may not retaliate or take adverse action against any key employee
or person who does not consent to the issuance of insurance on the key employee or key person's
life. For purposes of this subdivision, a "key employee" or "key person" means an individual whose
position or compensation is described in section 101(j)(2)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through December 31, 2008.
   (i) A financial institution or other person to whom a debt is owed, whether for the purposes of
premium financing or otherwise, has an insurable interest in the life of the borrower limited to the
amount of debt owed plus reasonable interest and service charges.
     Subd. 3. Insured's own life. An individual has an insurable interest in the individual's own life
and an individual of competent legal capacity that procures or effects a policy on the individual's own
life may designate any person as the beneficiary, provided the policy is not part of or in furtherance
of an act, practice, or arrangement that is otherwise prohibited by this act.
    Subd. 4. Reliance on statements. An insurer is entitled to rely upon all reasonable statements,
declarations, and representations made by an applicant for life insurance relative to the existence
of an insurable interest; and no insurer shall incur legal liability, except as set forth in the policy,
by virtue of untrue statements, declarations, or representations so relied upon in good faith by the
insurer.
    Subd. 5. Consent of insured. A policy upon the life of an individual, other than a policy of
noncontributory group life insurance, may not be effectuated unless, on or before the time the policy
is effectuated, the individual insured, having legal capacity to contract, applies for or consents in
writing to the policy and its terms. Consent may be given by another in the following cases:
   (1) a parent or a person having legal custody of a minor may consent to the issuance of a policy
on a dependent child;
   (2) a court-appointed guardian of a person may consent to the issuance of a policy on the person
under guardianship;
4034                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [47TH DAY

    (3) a court-appointed conservator of a person's estate may consent to the issuance of a policy on
the person whose estate is under conservatorship;
    (4) an attorney-in-fact may consent to the issuance of a policy on the person that appointed
the attorney-in-fact for the limited purpose of replacing one or more policies with one or more
new policies, provided the aggregate amount of life insurance on the person as the result of the
replacement remains the same or decreases;
    (5) a trustee of a revocable trust may consent to the issuance of a policy on the life of a settlor
of the trust; and
    (6) a court of general jurisdiction may give consent to the issuance of a policy upon a showing
of facts the court considers sufficient to justify the issuance of the policy.
   Sec. 4. [60A.0784] PROHIBITED PRACTICES.
   It is unlawful for any person to:
   (1) procure or cause to be procured or effected a policy in violation of section 60A.0783;
   (2) engage in STOLI practices or otherwise wager on life;
  (3) solicit, market, or otherwise promote the purchase of a policy for the purpose of or with an
emphasis on the subsequent sale of the policy in the secondary market;
    (4) enter into a premium finance agreement with any person or agency, or any person affiliated
with such person or agency, pursuant to which the lender or any person affiliated with the lender
shall receive any proceeds, fees, or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from the policy or
policyowner or any other person with respect to the premium finance agreement or any settlement
contract or other transaction related to such policy that are in addition to the amounts required to
pay the principal, interest, and service charges related to policy premiums pursuant to the premium
finance agreement or subsequent sale of such agreement; provided, further, that any payments,
charges, fees, or other amounts in addition to the amounts required to pay the principal, interest,
and service charges related to policy premiums paid under the premium finance agreement shall
be remitted to the insured or to the insured's estate if the insured is not living at the time of the
determination of the overpayment; or
    (5) enter into or to offer to enter into a settlement contract prior to the issuance of a policy that
is the subject of the settlement contract or proposed settlement contract.
   Sec. 5. [60A.0785] PROHIBITION; ENTRY INTO SETTLEMENT CONTRACTS.
    Subdivision 1. Prohibition. No prospective purchaser of the policy or beneficial interest in the
policy shall, at any time prior to issuance of a policy, or during a four-year period commencing
with the date of issuance of the policy, enter into a settlement contract or any other agreement the
effect of which is to acquire the policy or a beneficial interest in the policy regardless of the date
the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise,
bequest, or surrender of the policy or beneficial interest in the policy is to occur, unless and until the
prospective purchaser has determined, based on reasonable inquiry, which includes but is not limited
to questioning the insured and reviewing the broker's files, that none of the following circumstances
are present:
47TH DAY]                              TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2009                                           4035

    (1) there was an agreement or understanding, before issuance of the policy, between the insured,
policyowner, or owner of a beneficial interest in the policy, and another person to guarantee any
liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy or an interest therein, including through
an assumption or forgiveness of a loan; or
   (2) both of the following are present:
    (i) all or a portion of the policy premiums were funded by means other than by the insured's
personal assets or assets provided by a person who is closely related to the insured by blood or
law or who has a lawful and substantial economic interest in the continued life of the insured. For
purposes of this provision, funds from a premium finance loan are considered assets of the insured
or such person only if the insured or such person is contractually obligated to repay the full amount
of the loan and to pledge personal assets, other than the policy itself, for loan amounts exceeding
the policy's cash value; and
    (ii) the insured underwent a life expectancy evaluation within the 18-month time period
immediately prior to the issuance of the policy and, during the same time period, the results of the
life expectancy evaluation were shared with or used by any person for the purpose of determining
the actual or potential value of the policy in the secondary market. Nothing in this paragraph shall
prevent such a life expectancy evaluation from being shared with or used by the insured or the
insured's accountant, attorney, or insurance producer for estate planning purposes so long as the
life expectancy evaluation is not used by such persons to determine the actual or potential value
of the policy in the secondary market.
    Subd. 2. Certification. As part of the prospective purchaser's responsibility to make reasonable
inquiry, the prospective purchaser shall request, and the settlement broker shall provide, a
certification in which the broker certifies that, to the best of the broker's knowledge, any life
expectancy evaluation performed on the insured prior to the issuance of the policy was not used by
or shared with any other person prior to the issuance of the policy for the purpose of determining
the actual or potential value of the policy in the secondary market.
   Subd. 3. Legitimate insurance transactions. Nothing in this act prevents:
    (1) any policyowner, whether or not the policyowner is also the subject of the insurance, from
entering into a legitimate settlement contract;
   (2) any person from soliciting a person to enter into a legitimate settlement contract;
    (3) a person from enforcing the payment of proceeds from the interest obtained under a legitimate
settlement contract; or
    (4) the assignment, sale, transfer, devise, or bequest with respect to the death benefit or ownership
of any portion of a policy, provided the assignment, sale, transfer, devise, or bequest is connected
to a legitimate settlement contract and not part of or in furtherance of STOLI practices.
   Sec. 6. [60A.0786] PRESUMPTION OF STOLI PRACTICES.
    Subdivision 1. Presumption of STOLI practices. A settlement contract, or any agreement the
effect of which is to sell or acquire the policy or a beneficial interest in the policy, entered into within

    (1) there was an agreement or understanding, before issuance of the policy, between the insured,
policyowner, or owner of a beneficial interest in the policy, and another person to guarantee any
liability or to purchase, or stand ready to purchase, the policy or an interest in the policy, including
through an assumption or forgiveness of a loan; or
   (2) both of the following are present:
    (i) all or a portion of the policy premiums were funded by means other than by the insured's
personal assets or assets provided by a person who is closely related to the insured by blood or
law or who has a lawful and substantial economic interest in the continued life of the insured. For
purposes of this provision, funds from a premium finance loan are considered assets of the insured
or that person only if the insured or that person is contractually obligated to repay the full amount
of the loan and to pledge personal assets, other than the policy itself, for loan amounts exceeding
the policy's cash value; and
    (ii) the insured underwent a life expectancy evaluation within the 18-month time period
immediately prior to the issuance of the policy and, during the same time period, the results of the
life expectancy evaluation were shared with or used by any person for the purpose of determining
the actual or potential value of the policy in the secondary market.
    Subd. 2. Not applicable in criminal proceedings. The rebuttable presumption created in this
section does not apply in any criminal proceeding.
  Sec. 7. [60A.0787] PROCESSING CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR BENEFICIARY
REQUESTS.
    Subdivision 1. Obligation to process change of ownership or beneficiary requests. Upon
receipt of a properly completed request for change of ownership or beneficiary of a policy and, if
applicable, the completed questionnaire described in this section, the insurer shall respond in writing
within 30 calendar days with written acknowledgment confirming that the change has been effected
or specifying the reasons why the requested change cannot be processed. The insurer shall not
unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary and shall not otherwise interfere
with any permitted settlement contract entered into in this state.
    Subd. 2. Written questionnaire. If the insurer receives a request for change of ownership or
beneficiary within the four-year period commencing with the date the policy is issued, the insurer
may require, as a condition of effecting the requested change, that the policyowner complete and
return a written questionnaire designed to determine whether the change request relates to or is made
in accordance with a settlement contract and if so, whether the circumstances described in section
60A.0785 are present. The questionnaire shall be in a form approved by the commissioner and shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
   (1) the definition of settlement contract;
    (2) an inquiry regarding whether the request for change of ownership or beneficiary relates to or
is made in accordance with a settlement contract;
   (3) if the answer to clause (2) is "yes," then an inquiry regarding whether the circumstances
described in section 60A.0785 are present;
   (4) a disclosure that presenting false material information, or concealing material information,

in connection with the questionnaire is defined under the laws of this state as a fraudulent act; and
    (5) a signed certification by the policyowner that the answers and information provided in and
pursuant to the questionnaire are true and complete to the best of the policyowner's knowledge and
belief.
    Subd. 3. Other inquiries. Nothing in this section should be interpreted to limit an insurer's
ability to make other inquiries to detect STOLI practices.
   Subd. 4. Fraternal benefit societies. Nothing in this act shall prohibit a fraternal benefit society
regulated under chapter 64B from enforcing the terms of its bylaws or rules regarding permitted
beneficiaries and owners.
   Sec. 8. [60A.0788] FRAUDULENT ACTS.
   Subdivision 1. Fraudulent acts. A person who commits a fraudulent act as defined in this section
commits insurance fraud and may be sentenced under section 609.611, subdivision 3.
   Subd. 2. List of fraudulent acts. All of the following acts are fraudulent when committed by
a person who, with intent to defraud and for the purpose of depriving another of property or for
pecuniary gain, commits, or permits any of its employees or its agents to commit them:
   (1) failing to disclose to the insurer where the insurer has requested such disclosure that the
prospective insured has undergone a life expectancy evaluation;
    (2) misrepresenting a person's state of residence or facilitating the change of the state in which
a person resides for the express purpose of evading or avoiding the provisions of this act;
    (3) presenting, causing to be presented, or preparing with knowledge or belief that it will be
presented to an insurer any false material information, or concealing any material information, as
part of, in support of, or concerning a fact material to one or more of the following:
   (i) a questionnaire as provided for under section 60A.0787; or
    (ii) any other documents or communications, whether written or verbal, which are intended to
detect STOLI practices or demonstrate compliance with this act;
    (4) encouraging the insured, policyowner, or owner of a beneficial interest in the policy to falsely
state that the circumstances described in section 60A.0785 are not present or aiding in the preparation
or execution of documents designed to create the false impression that those circumstances are not
present; and
   (5) failing to request or to provide the broker certification required by section 60A.0785,
subdivision 2, or falsely certifying that the life expectancy evaluation in section 60A.0785,
subdivision 2, was not shared with any other person prior to the issuance of the policy for the
purpose of determining the actual or potential value of the policy in the secondary market.
   Sec. 9. [60A.0789] REMEDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Actions to recover death benefits. (a) If the beneficiary, assignee, or other
payee receives the death benefits under a life insurance policy initiated by STOLI practices or a
policy procured or effected in violation of section 60A.0783 or section 60A.0785, the personal
4038                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [47TH DAY

representative of the insured's estate or other lawfully acting agent may maintain an action to
recover such benefits from the person receiving them.
   (b) Where a person receives the death benefit as a result of a nonwillful violation of this act, the
court may limit the recovery to unjust enrichment, calculated as the benefits received plus interest
from the date of receipt, less premiums paid under the policy by the recipient and any consideration
paid by the recipient to the insured in connection with the policy.
    (c) Where a person receives the death benefits as the result of a willful violation of this act,
the court may, in addition to actual damages, order the defendant or defendants to pay exemplary
damages in an amount up to two times the death benefits. A pattern of violations of this act and
conduct involving one or more fraudulent acts are evidence of willfulness. The exemplary damages
shall be paid to one or more governmental agencies charged with combating consumer fraud,
including the Department of Commerce.
    (d) The court may award reasonable attorney fees, together with costs and disbursements, to any
party that recovers damages in any action brought under this subdivision.
    (e) An action under this subdivision must be brought within two years after the death of the
insured.
   Subd. 2. Enforceability of contracts. Any contract, agreement, arrangement, or transaction
prohibited under this act is voidable.
    Subd. 3. Declaratory judgment action. If, prior to payment of death benefits, the insurer
believes the policy was initiated by STOLI practices, the insurer may bring a declaratory judgment
action seeking a court order declaring the policy void.
   Subd. 4. Effect on other law. This act shall not:
    (1) preempt or limit other civil remedies, including, but not limited to, declaratory judgments,
injunctive relief, and interpleaders;
   (2) preempt the authority or relieve the duty of other law enforcement or regulatory agencies to
investigate, examine, and prosecute suspected violations of law;
    (3) limit the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to the commissioner or an
insurance fraud unit or the attorney general to investigate and examine possible violations of law
and to take appropriate actions against wrongdoers; or
   (4) limit the power of this state to punish a person for conduct that constitutes a crime under
other laws of this state.
   Sec. 10. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 61A.073; and 61A.074, are repealed.
   Sec. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This act is effective for policies issued on or after the day following final enactment."

read:
    Subd. 13. Actions related to stimulus projects. This section applies to the construction of a
stimulus project, as authorized in section 469.176, subdivision 8.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. [116J.408] TEMPORARY LOAN GUARANTEE ACCOUNT.
    Subdivision 1. Construction loan guarantee program created. The commissioner of
employment and economic development shall administer a program under this section to guarantee
loans by a private lender for construction projects in this state that will commence on or after July
1, 2009. A loan guarantee may not be made after December 31, 2012.
   Subd. 2. Eligible projects. A project is eligible for a guarantee under this section if it has a private
loan commitment of $5,000,000 or more to pay for the costs of a related residential, commercial,
industrial, or institutional construction project.

    Subd. 3. Guarantee amount limits. A guarantee may not be made for more than 25 percent of
the principal amount of the loan made by a private lender.
    Subd. 4. Loan guarantee application process. The commissioner shall develop an application
form by which a person may apply for a loan guarantee. The application shall request information
required by the commissioner to determine whether a project loan is eligible for a guarantee and
to determine whether a guarantee should be issued. The application must be submitted jointly by
a lender and a project developer. The commissioner shall issue loan guarantees quarterly. The first
round of guarantees must be issued for applications submitted by June 30, 2009.
    Subd. 5. Guarantee criteria. (a) In issuing loan guarantees for projects, the commissioner shall
attempt to distribute the projects throughout the state. The commissioner shall require information
from an applicant concerning the number of jobs involved in a project and the wages expected to
be paid for jobs related to the project and may consider the number of jobs created in relation to the
amount of a loan guarantee.
    (b) The ability of the borrower to repay the loan from cash flow of the project is the primary
consideration in deciding whether to issue a loan guarantee. A comprehensive source of standard
financial ratios and financial statistics must be compared to companies in the same industry. Other
criteria, including audited financial statements, management capability, collateral, and owner's
equity contribution, are important considerations, consistent with normal bank underwriting
standards.
   (c) The lender must certify that the state guarantee is necessary for the construction project to
proceed and that without the guarantee the loan as described in the application will not be made.
    Subd. 6. Construction loan guarantee account. A construction loan guarantee account is
established in the state treasury. Money in the account consists of money appropriated to the
account, interest and other earnings on money in the account, fees credited to the account under
subdivision 7, sales and local taxes credited to the account under subdivision 8, and money received
