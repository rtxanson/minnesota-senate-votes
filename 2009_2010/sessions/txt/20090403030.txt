13, by adding a subdivision; 332A.04, subdivision 6; 332A.08; 332A.10; 332A.11, subdivision 2;
332A.14; proposing coding for new law as Minnesota Statutes, chapter 332B.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 45.011, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Scope. As used in chapters 45 to 83, 155A, 332, 332A, 332B, 345, and 359,
and sections 325D.30 to 325D.42, 326B.802 to 326B.885, and 386.61 to 386.78, unless the context
indicates otherwise, the terms defined in this section have the meanings given them.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 46.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. The commissioner of commerce, referred to in chapters 46 to 59A,        ­
and ­c­
      h­ p­e
        a­ t­­     ­ and 332B as the commissioner, is vested with all the powers, authority, and
             r 332A,
privileges which, prior to the enactment of Laws 1909, chapter 201, were conferred by law upon
the public examiner, and shall take over all duties in relation to state banks, savings banks, trust
companies, savings associations, and other financial institutions within the state which, prior to
the enactment of chapter 201, were imposed upon the public examiner. The commissioner of
commerce shall exercise a constant supervision, either personally or through the examiners herein
provided for, over the books and affairs of all state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings
associations, credit unions, industrial loan and thrift companies, and other financial institutions
doing business within this state; and shall, through examiners, examine each financial institution at
1474                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [30TH DAY

least once every 24 calendar months. In satisfying this examination requirement, the commissioner
may accept reports of examination prepared by a federal agency having comparable supervisory
powers and examination procedures. With the exception of industrial loan and thrift companies
which do not have deposit liabilities and licensed regulated lenders, it shall be the principal
purpose of these examinations to inspect and verify the assets and liabilities of each and so far
investigate the character and value of the assets of each institution as to determine with reasonable
certainty that the values are correctly carried on its books. Assets and liabilities shall be verified in
accordance with methods of procedure which the commissioner may determine to be adequate to
carry out the intentions of this section. It shall be the further purpose of these examinations to assess
the adequacy of capital protection and the capacity of the institution to meet usual and reasonably
anticipated deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments without resorting to excessive
borrowing or sale of assets at a significant loss, and to investigate each institution's compliance
with applicable laws and rules. Based on the examination findings, the commissioner shall make
a determination as to whether the institution is being operated in a safe and sound manner. None
of the above provisions limits the commissioner in making additional examinations as deemed
necessary or advisable. The commissioner shall investigate the methods of operation and conduct
of these institutions and their systems of accounting, to ascertain whether these methods and
systems are in accordance with law and sound banking principles. The commissioner may make
requirements as to records as deemed necessary to facilitate the carrying out of the commissioner's
duties and to properly protect the public interest. The commissioner may examine, or cause to be
examined by these examiners, on oath, any officer, director, trustee, owner, agent, clerk, customer,
or depositor of any financial institution touching the affairs and business thereof, and may issue, or
cause to be issued by the examiners, subpoenas, and administer, or cause to be administered by
the examiners, oaths. In case of any refusal to obey any subpoena issued under the commissioner's
direction, the refusal may at once be reported to the district court of the district in which the bank
or other financial institution is located, and this court shall enforce obedience to these subpoenas
in the manner provided by law for enforcing obedience to subpoenas of the court. In all matters
relating to official duties, the commissioner of commerce has the power possessed by courts of law
to issue subpoenas and cause them to be served and enforced, and all officers, directors, trustees,
and employees of state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings associations, and other
financial institutions within the state, and all persons having dealings with or knowledge of the
affairs or methods of these institutions, shall afford reasonable facilities for these examinations,
make returns and reports to the commissioner of commerce as the commissioner may require;
attend and answer, under oath, the commissioner's lawful inquiries; produce and exhibit any books,
accounts, documents, and property as the commissioner may desire to inspect, and in all things aid
the commissioner in the performance of duties.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 46.05, is amended to read:
   46.05 SUPERVISION OVER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
    Every state bank, savings bank, trust company, savings association, debt management services
provider, debt settlement services provider, and other financial institutions shall be at all times under
the supervision and subject to the control of the commissioner of commerce. If, and whenever in the
performance of duties, the commissioner finds it necessary to make a special investigation of any
financial institution under the commissioner's supervision, and other than a complete examination,
the commissioner shall make a charge therefor to include only the necessary costs thereof. Such a
fee shall be payable to the commissioner on the commissioner's making a request for payment.

regulated lender, industrial loan and thrift company, credit union, motor vehicle sales finance
company, debt management services provider, debt settlement services provider, and insurance
premium finance company organized under the laws of this state or required to be administered by

meeting between the solicitor who makes the call and the prospective purchaser; or
    (iii) by a political party as defined under section 200.02, subdivision 6.

periodic payments to the debtor's creditors from funds that the debt management services provider

    Any person so engaged or holding out as so engaged is deemed to be engaged in the provision
of debt management services regardless of whether or not a fee is charged for such services.

    (4) Regulatory restrictions; powers of the commissioner. To assure that self-insurance
or insurance plans are financially solvent, are administered in a fair and equitable fashion, and
are processing claims and paying benefits in a prompt, fair, and honest manner, vendors of risk
management services and entities administering insurance or self-insurance plans are subject to the
supervision and examination by the commissioner. Vendors of risk management services, entities
administering insurance or self-insurance plans, and insurance or self-insurance plans established
or operated by them are subject to the trade practice requirements of sections 72A.19 to 72A.30.
In lieu of an unlimited guarantee from a parent corporation for a vendor of risk management
services or an entity administering insurance or self-insurance plans, the commissioner may accept
a surety bond in a form satisfactory to the commissioner in an amount equal to 120 percent of the
total amount of claims handled by the applicant in the prior year. If at any time the total amount
of claims handled during a year exceeds the amount upon which the bond was calculated, the
administrator shall immediately notify the commissioner. The commissioner may require that the
bond be increased accordingly.
    No contract entered into after July 1, 2001, between a licensed vendor of risk management
services and a group authorized to self-insure for workers' compensation liabilities under section
79A.03, subdivision 6, may take effect until it has been filed with the commissioner, and either

shall:
    (a) require a patient to pay for care provided by an in-network provider an amount that exceeds
the fee negotiated between the entity and that provider for the covered service provided;
    (b) attempt to recoup from the provider a payment owed to the provider by the patient for
deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance, or other enrollee cost-sharing required under the plan, unless
the administrator has confirmed with the provider that the patient has paid the cost-sharing amounts
in full; or
    (c) limit the time period for a provider to submit a claim, which may not be less than 90 days
through contract except when otherwise required by state or federal law or regulation, unless the
health care provider knew or was informed of the correct name and address of the responsible
health plan company or third-party administrator. For purposes of this paragraph, presentation of
the health coverage identification card by the patient is deemed sufficient notification of the correct
information.

complaint. The commissioner may conduct compliance reviews to determine whether health care
providers and group purchasers are complying with this section.

purchaser must so certify and set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.
    (3) Any individually identifiable health information obtained by the commissioner of health

compliance with this section.
    (e) If an investigation of a complaint indicates noncompliance, the commissioner of health
shall attempt to reach a resolution of the matter by informal means. Informal means may include
demonstrated compliance or a completed corrective action plan or other agreement. If the matter is
resolved by informal means, the commissioner of health shall so inform the health care provider
or group purchaser and, if the matter arose from a complaint, the complainant, in writing. If the
matter is not resolved by informal means, the commissioner of health shall:
    (1) inform the health care provider or group purchaser and provide an opportunity for the health
care provider or group purchaser to submit written evidence of any mitigating factors or other
considerations. The health care provider or group purchaser must submit any such evidence to the
commissioner of health within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notification; and
    (2) inform the health care provider or group purchaser, through a notice of proposed
determination according to paragraph (i), that the commissioner of health finds that a civil money
penalty should be imposed.
    (f) If, after an investigation or a compliance review, the commissioner of health determines that
further action is not warranted, the commissioner of health shall so inform the health care provider
or group purchaser and, if the matter arose from a complaint, the complainant, in writing.

contested case proceeding under this section; or
    (3) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by this section, provided the individual or
person has a good faith belief that the practice opposed is unlawful, and the manner of opposition
is reasonable and does not involve an unauthorized disclosure of a patient's health information.
    (h) The commissioner of health may impose a civil money penalty on a health care provider
or group purchaser if the commissioner of health determines that the health care provider or group
purchaser has violated this section. If the commissioner of health determines that more than one
health care provider or group purchaser was responsible for a violation, the commissioner of health
may impose a civil money penalty against each health care provider or group purchaser. The amount
of a civil money penalty shall be determined as follows:
   (1) The amount of a civil money penalty shall be up to $100 for each violation, but not exceed
$25,000 for identical violations during a calendar year.
   (2) In the case of continuing violation of this section, a separate violation occurs each business
day that the health care provider or group purchaser is in violation of this section.

the commissioner of health provided in the context of a compliance effort; or
     (x) the financial condition of the health care provider or group purchaser including, but not
limited to, whether the health care provider or group purchaser had financial difficulties that affected
its ability to comply or whether the imposition of a civil money penalty would jeopardize the ability
of the health care provider or group purchaser to continue to provide, or to pay for, health care.
    (i) If a penalty is proposed according to this section, the commissioner of health must deliver,
or send by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the respondent written notice of the

30 calendar days permits the imposition of the proposed penalty; and
   (6) the address to which the contested case proceeding request must be sent.
    (j) A health care provider or group purchaser may contest whether the finding of facts constitute
a violation of this section, according to a contested case proceeding as set forth in sections 14.57 to

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 319B.08, is amended to read:
   319B.08 EFFECT OF DEATH OR DISQUALIFICATION OF OWNER.
  Subdivision 1. Acquisition of interests or automatic loss of professional firm status. (a) If an
owner dies or becomes disqualified to practice all the pertinent professional services, then either:
   (1) within 90 days after the death or the beginning of the disqualification, all of that owner's
ownership interest must be acquired by the professional firm, by persons permitted by section
319B.07 to own the ownership interest, or by some combination; or
   (2) at the end of the 90-day period, the firm's election under section 319B.03, subdivision 2, or
319B.04, subdivision 2, is automatically rescinded, the firm loses its status as a professional firm,
and the authority created by that election and status terminates.
   An acquisition satisfies clause (1) if all right and title to the deceased or disqualified owner's
1508                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [30TH DAY

interest are acquired before the end of the 90-day period, even if some or all of the consideration
is paid after the end of the 90-day period. However, payment cannot be secured in any way that
violates sections 319B.01 to 319B.12.
    (b) If automatic rescission does occur under paragraph (a), the firm must immediately and
accordingly update its organizational document, certificate of authority, or statement of foreign
qualification. Even without that updating, however, the rescission, loss of status, and termination
of authority provided by paragraph (a) occur automatically at the end of the 90-day period.
   Subd. 2. Terms of acquisition. (a) If:
   (1) an owner dies or becomes disqualified to practice all the pertinent professional services;
   (2) the professional firm has in effect a mechanism, valid according to the professional firm's
generally applicable governing law, to effect a purchase of the deceased or disqualified owner's
ownership interest so as to satisfy subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (1); and
   (3) the professional firm does not agree with the disqualified owner or the representative of the
deceased owner to set aside the mechanism,
then that mechanism applies.
   (b) If:
   (1) an owner dies or becomes disqualified to practice all the pertinent professional services;
   (2) the professional firm has in effect no mechanism as described in paragraph (a), or has agreed
as mentioned in paragraph (a), clause (3), to set aside that mechanism; and
    (3) consistent with its generally applicable governing law, the professional firm agrees with the
disqualified owner or the representative of the deceased owner, before the end of the 90-day period,
to an arrangement to effect a purchase of the deceased or disqualified owner's ownership interest so
as to satisfy subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (1),
then that arrangement applies.
   (c) If:
    (1) an owner of a Minnesota professional firm dies or becomes disqualified to practice all the
pertinent professional services;
   (2) the Minnesota professional firm does not have in effect a mechanism as described in
paragraph (a);
    (3) the Minnesota professional firm does not make an arrangement as described in paragraph
(b); and
   (4) no provision or tenet of the Minnesota professional firm's generally applicable governing law
and no provision of any document or agreement authorized by the Minnesota professional firm's
generally applicable governing law expressly precludes an acquisition under this paragraph,
then the firm may acquire the deceased or disqualified owner's ownership interest as stated in this
paragraph. To act under this paragraph, the Minnesota professional firm must within 90 days after
30TH DAY]                            FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009                                       1509

the death or beginning of the disqualification tender to the representative of the deceased owner's
estate or to the disqualified owner the fair value of the owner's ownership interest, as determined by
the Minnesota professional firm's governance authority. That price must be at least the book value,
as determined in accordance with the Minnesota professional firm's regular method of accounting,
as of the end of the month immediately preceding the death or loss of license. The tender must be
unconditional and may not attempt to have the recipient waive any rights provided in this section.
If the Minnesota professional firm tenders a price under this paragraph within the 90-day period,
the deceased or disqualified owner's ownership interest immediately transfers to the Minnesota
professional firm regardless of any dispute as to the fairness of the price. A disqualified owner
or representative of the deceased owner's estate who disputes the fairness of the tendered price may
take the tendered price and bring suit in district court seeking additional payment. The suit must
be commenced within one year after the payment is tendered. A Minnesota professional firm may
agree with a disqualified owner or the representative of a deceased owner's estate to delay all or part
of the payment due under this paragraph, but all right and title to the owner's ownership interests
must be acquired before the end of the 90-day period and payment may not be secured in any way
that violates sections 319B.01 to 319B.12.
    Subd. 3. Expiration of firm-issued option on death or disqualification of holder. If the holder
of an option issued under section 319B.07, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (1), dies or becomes
disqualified, the option automatically expires.
    Subd. 4. One-year period for surviving spouse of sole owner. For purposes of this section,
each mention of "90 days," "90-day period," or similar term shall be interpreted as one year after
the death of a professional who was the sole owner of the professional firm if the surviving spouse
of the deceased professional owns and controls the firm after the death.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
surviving spouses of professionals who die on or after that date.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 319B.09, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Governance authority. (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b), a professional firm's
governance authority must rest with:
    (1) one or more professionals, each of whom is licensed to furnish at least one category of the
pertinent professional services; or
    (2) a surviving spouse of a deceased professional who was the sole owner of the professional
firm, while the surviving spouse owns and controls the firm, but only during the period of time
ending one year after the death of the professional.
    (b) In a Minnesota professional firm organized under chapter 317A and in a foreign professional
firm organized under the nonprofit corporation statute of another state, at least one individual
possessing governance authority must be a professional licensed to furnish at least one category of
the pertinent professional services.
    (c) Individuals who possess governance authority within a professional firm may delegate
administrative and operational matters to others. No decision entailing the exercise of professional
judgment may be delegated or assigned to anyone who is not a professional licensed to practice
the professional services involved in the decision.

    (d) An individual whose license to practice any pertinent professional services is revoked or
suspended may not, during the time the revocation or suspension is in effect, possess or exercise
governance authority, hold a position with governance authority, or take part in any decision or other
action constituting an exercise of governance authority. Nothing in this chapter prevents a board
from further terminating, restricting, limiting, qualifying, or imposing conditions on an individual's
governance role as board disciplinary action.
   (e) A professional firm owned and controlled by a surviving spouse must comply with all
requirements of this chapter, except those clearly inapplicable to a firm owned and governed by a
surviving spouse who is not a professional of the same type as the surviving spouse's decedent.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
surviving spouses of professionals who die on or after that date."

child is expected to be discharged from foster care, the responsible social services agency is required
to provide the child with assistance and support in developing a transition plan that is personalized
at the direction of the child. The transition plan must be as detailed as the child may elect and

the state, gaps in service delivery, and any administrative inefficiencies generally; and
   (2) a description of the manner in which the money is being used within the agencies or
organizations, the performance measures in place to assess the use of the money, and the intended
outcomes of the programs and services, to the extent this information is available.

whose suggestion is determined by the commissioner to have resulted in documented cost-savings
to the state. The maximum award is the lesser of ten percent of the documented savings in the first
fiscal year in which the employee's suggestion is implemented or $2,500. The award must be paid
from the appropriation to which the savings accrued.

                       ­­s hours required by section 120A.41. It may provide instruction throughout
the year according to sections 124D.12 to 124D.127 or 124D.128.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Nonresident tuition rate; other costs. (a) For fiscal year 2006, when a school
district provides instruction and services outside the district of residence, board and lodging, and
any tuition to be paid, shall be paid by the district of residence. The tuition rate to be charged for
any child with a disability, excluding a pupil for whom tuition is calculated according to section
127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (d), must be the sum of (1) the actual cost of providing special
instruction and services to the child including a proportionate amount for special transportation and
unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily for special education,
plus (2) the amount of general education revenue and referendum aid attributable to the pupil, minus
(3) the amount of special education aid for children with a disability received on behalf of that child,
minus (4) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the regular classroom for
more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education revenue and referendum
aid, excluding portions attributable to district and school administration, district support services,
operations and maintenance, capital expenditures, and pupil transportation, attributable to that pupil
for the portion of time the pupil receives special instruction and services outside of the regular
classroom. If the boards involved do not agree upon the tuition rate, either board may apply to the
commissioner to fix the rate. Notwithstanding chapter 14, the commissioner must then set a date
for a hearing or request a written statement from each board, giving each board at least ten days'
notice, and after the hearing or review of the written statements the commissioner must make an
order fixing the tuition rate, which is binding on both school districts. General education revenue
and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated using the resident district's
average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per adjusted pupil unit.
    (b) For fiscal year 2007 and later, when a school district provides special instruction and
services for a pupil with a disability as defined in section 125A.02 outside the district of residence,
excluding a pupil for whom an adjustment to special education aid is calculated according to
section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (e), special education aid paid to the resident district
must be reduced by an amount equal to (1) the actual cost of providing special instruction and
services to the pupil, including a proportionate amount for special transportation and unreimbursed
building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily for special education, plus (2)
the amount of general education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to that
pupil, calculated using the resident district's average general education revenue and referendum
equalization aid per adjusted pupil unit excluding basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue
and secondary sparsity revenue, minus (3) the amount of special education aid for children with a
disability received on behalf of that child, minus (4) if the pupil receives special instruction and

services outside the regular classroom for more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount
of general education revenue and referendum equalization aid, excluding portions attributable to
district and school administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital
expenditures, and pupil transportation, attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil
receives special instruction and services outside of the regular classroom, calculated using the
resident district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per adjusted
pupil unit excluding basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue and secondary sparsity
revenue and the serving district's basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue and secondary
sparsity revenue per adjusted pupil unit. Notwithstanding clauses (1) and (4), for pupils served
by a cooperative unit without a fiscal agent school district, the general education revenue and
referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated using the resident district's
average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid excluding compensatory
revenue, elementary sparsity revenue, and secondary sparsity revenue. Special education aid
paid to the district or cooperative providing special instruction and services for the pupil must be
increased by the amount of the reduction in the aid paid to the resident district. Amounts paid to
cooperatives under this subdivision and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, shall be recognized and
reported as revenues and expenditures on the resident school district's books of account under
sections 123B.75 and 123B.76. If the resident district's special education aid is insufficient to make
the full adjustment, the remaining adjustment shall be made to other state aid due to the district.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (d)
and (e), a charter school where more than 30 percent of enrolled students receive special education
and related services, a site approved under section 125A.515, an intermediate district, a special
education cooperative, or a school district that served as the applicant agency for a group of school
districts for federal special education aids for fiscal year 2006 may apply to the commissioner for
authority to charge the resident district an additional amount to recover any remaining unreimbursed
costs of serving pupils with a disability. The application must include a description of the costs and
the calculations used to determine the unreimbursed portion to be charged to the resident district.
Amounts approved by the commissioner under this paragraph must be included in the tuition billings
or aid adjustments under paragraph (a) or (b), or section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (d) or
(e), as applicable.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (d) and
(e), "general education revenue and referendum equalization aid" means the sum of the general
education revenue according to section 126C.10, subdivision 1, excluding alternative teacher
compensation revenue, plus the referendum equalization aid according to section 126C.17,
subdivision 7, as adjusted according to section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (a) to (c).
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.05, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Foreign exchange pupils. Notwithstanding section 124D.02, subdivision 3, or any
other law to the contrary, a foreign exchange pupil enrolled in a district under a cultural exchange
program registered with the Office of the Secretary of State under section 5A.02 may be counted
as a resident pupil for the purposes of this chapter and chapters 120B, 122A, 123A, 123B, 124D,
125A, and 127A, even if the pupil has graduated from high school or the equivalent.

   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Consolidated tax rate. The commissioner must establish the consolidated tax rate
by July 1 of each year for levies payable in the following year. The consolidated tax capacity rate
must be a rate rounded up to the nearest hundredth of a percent that, when applied to the adjusted
net tax capacity for all districts, raises the amounts specified in this subdivision. The consolidated
tax rate must be the rate that raises $227,259,000 for fiscal year 2011, $428,674,000 for fiscal year
2012, and $584,940,000 for fiscal year 2013 and later years. The consolidated tax rate may not be
changed due to changes or corrections made to a district's adjusted net tax capacity after the tax rate
has been established. A school district may adopt a board resolution to reduce its levy below the
amount calculated in this section.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3b. Consolidated levy. To obtain general education revenue, a district may levy an amount
not to exceed the consolidated tax rate times the adjusted net tax capacity of the district for the
preceding year. If the amount of the consolidated levy would exceed the general education revenue,
the consolidated levy must be determined according to subdivision 3c. If a district adopts a board
resolution to reduce its consolidated levy according to subdivision 3a, the district's general education
aid shall be reduced proportionately.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3c. Consolidated levy; districts off the formula. If the amount of the consolidated levy
for a district exceeds the district's general education revenue, the amount of the consolidated levy
must be limited to the following:
   (1) the district's general education revenue; minus
   (2) payments made for the same school year according to section 126C.21, subdivision 3.
For purposes of statutory cross-reference, a levy made according to this subdivision shall be
construed to be the levy made according to subdivision 3b.

developed by the school board.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a district may allocate up to five percent of the amount of
compensatory revenue that the district receives to school sites according to a plan adopted by the
school board. The money reallocated under this paragraph must be spent for the purposes listed
in subdivision 1, but may be spent on students in any grade, including students attending school
readiness or other prekindergarten programs.

                                                      t The referendum must be conducted one or two calendar
years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one election to
approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted by mail
under subdivision 11, paragraph (a), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue
per resident marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board,
of increased revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the
number of years for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall
increase annually by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual
inflationary increase calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing
referendum levy authority is expiring. In this case, the ballot may also compare the proposed levy
authority to the existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount,
if any, over the expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number
of years, not to exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a
ballot on the question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must
abbreviate the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under
section 275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies at the same amount per
pupil as in the previous year:
        "BY VOTING "YES" ON THIS BALLOT QUESTION, YOU ARE VOTING TO EXTEND
        AN EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REFERENDUM THAT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE."
   The ballot may contain a textual portion with the information required in this subdivision and a
question stating substantially the following:
   "Shall the increase in the revenue proposed by (petition to) the board of ........., School District
No. .., be approved?"
    If approved, an amount equal to the approved revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit times
the resident marginal cost pupil units for the school year beginning in the year after the levy is
certified shall be authorized for certification for the number of years approved, if applicable, or until
revoked or reduced by the voters of the district at a subsequent referendum.
    (b) The board must prepare and deliver by first class mail at least 15 days but no more than 30
days before the day of the referendum to each taxpayer a notice of the referendum and the proposed
revenue increase. The board need not mail more than one notice to any taxpayer. For the purpose of
giving mailed notice under this subdivision, owners must be those shown to be owners on the records
of the county auditor or, in any county where tax statements are mailed by the county treasurer,
on the records of the county treasurer. Every property owner whose name does not appear on the
records of the county auditor or the county treasurer is deemed to have waived this mailed notice
unless the owner has requested in writing that the county auditor or county treasurer, as the case
may be, include the name on the records for this purpose. The notice must project the anticipated
amount of tax increase in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads,
apartments, and commercial-industrial property within the school district.
    The notice for a referendum may state that an existing referendum levy is expiring and project

the anticipated amount of increase over the existing referendum levy in the first year, if any,
in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads, apartments, and
commercial-industrial property within the district.
    The notice must include the following statement: "Passage of this referendum will result in
an increase in your property taxes." However, in cases of renewing existing levies, the notice
may include the following statement: "Passage of this referendum extends an existing operating
referendum at the same amount per pupil as in the previous year."

(a) must be available to the school district at least once before it is subject to a referendum on its
revocation or reduction for subsequent years. Only one revocation or reduction referendum may be

     Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.44, is amended to read:
     126C.44 SAFE SCHOOLS LEVY.
    (a) Each district may make a levy on all taxable property located within the district for the
purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for
a drug abuse prevention program as defined in section 609.101, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), in the
elementary schools; (3) to pay the costs for a gang resistance education training curriculum in the
district's schools; (4) to pay the costs for security in the district's schools and on school property;
(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.
       (c) A school district must set aside at least $3 per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit of the safe
schools levy proceeds for the purposes authorized under paragraph (a), clause (6). T                                    ­h ­­e­d­­s t­­c

  Sec. 36. [127A.335] PERMANENT SCHOOL TRUST FUND WIND ENERGY
REVENUE.
    For fiscal year 2010 and later, the commissioner shall transfer to the permanent school trust fund
an amount equal to the amount of money apportioned to all school districts for that year according
to section 272.029, subdivision 6, multiplied by the wind energy factor. The wind energy factor for
fiscal year 2010 and later is 0.5. These funds shall be managed as principal to the permanent school
trust fund.
  Sec. 37. [127A.431] REDUCTION OF AID FOR NOT PROVIDING REQUIRED HOURS
OF INSTRUCTION.
30TH DAY]                              FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009                                         1557

    The commissioner shall reduce the state aid paid to a school district or charter school that does
not provide instruction for at least the number of hours required under section 120A.41. If instruction
is not provided for the required number of hours, state aid shall be reduced by the ratio that the
difference between the required number of hours and the number of hours instruction is provided
bears to the required number of hours, multiplied by 60 percent of the basic revenue, as defined in
section 126C.10, subdivision 2, of the district or charter school for that year. However, a district or
charter school not providing the required number of hours may appeal to the commissioner for a
waiver of the state aid reduction if (1) the circumstances causing loss of instructional time below
the required minimum number of hours are beyond the control of the board, and (2) a good faith
attempt is made to make up time lost due to these circumstances.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.47, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Alternative attendance programs. The general education aid and special education aid
for districts must be adjusted for each pupil attending a nonresident district under sections 123A.05
to 123A.08, 124D.03, 124D.08, and 124D.68. The adjustments must be made according to this
subdivision.
    (a) General education aid paid to a resident district must be reduced by an amount equal to the
referendum equalization aid attributable to the pupil in the resident district.
    (b) General education aid paid to a district serving a pupil in programs listed in this subdivision
must be increased by an amount equal to the greater of (1) the referendum equalization aid
attributable to the pupil in the nonresident district; or (2) the product of the district's open enrollment
concentration index, the maximum amount of referendum revenue in the first tier, and the district's
net open enrollment pupil units for that year. A district's open enrollment concentration index
equals the greater of: (i) zero, or (ii) the lesser of 1.0, or the difference between the district's ratio
of open enrollment pupil units served to its resident pupil units for that year and 0.2. This clause
does not apply to a school district where more than 50 percent of the open enrollment students are
enrolled solely in online learning courses.
    (c) If the amount of the reduction to be made from the general education aid of the resident
district is greater than the amount of general education aid otherwise due the district, the excess
reduction must be made from other state aids due the district.
     (d) For fiscal year 2006, the district of residence must pay tuition to a district or an area learning
center, operated according to paragraph (f), providing special instruction and services to a pupil
with a disability, as defined in section 125A.02, or a pupil, as defined in section 125A.51, who is
enrolled in a program listed in this subdivision. The tuition must be equal to (1) the actual cost of
providing special instruction and services to the pupil, including a proportionate amount for special
transportation and unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily
for special education, minus (2) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the
regular classroom for more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education
revenue and referendum aid attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil receives
special instruction and services outside of the regular classroom, excluding portions attributable
to district and school administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital
expenditures, and pupil transportation, minus (3) special education aid attributable to that pupil, that
is received by the district providing special instruction and services. For purposes of this paragraph,
general education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated

using the serving district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per
adjusted pupil unit.
    (e) For fiscal year 2007 and later, special education aid paid to a resident district must be reduced
by an amount equal to (1) the actual cost of providing special instruction and services, including
special transportation and unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used
primarily for special education, for a pupil with a disability, as defined in section 125A.02, or a
pupil, as defined in section 125A.51, who is enrolled in a program listed in this subdivision, minus
(2) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the regular classroom for more than
60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education revenue and referendum equalization
aid attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil receives special instruction and
services outside of the regular classroom, excluding portions attributable to district and school
administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital expenditures, and
pupil transportation, minus (3) special education aid attributable to that pupil, that is received by
the district providing special instruction and services. For purposes of this paragraph, general
education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated
using the serving district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid
per adjusted pupil unit. Special education aid paid to the district or cooperative providing special
instruction and services for the pupil, or to the fiscal agent district for a cooperative, must be
increased by the amount of the reduction in the aid paid to the resident district. If the resident
district's special education aid is insufficient to make the full adjustment, the remaining adjustment
shall be made to other state aids due to the district.
     (f) An area learning center operated by a service cooperative, intermediate district, education
district, or a joint powers cooperative may elect through the action of the constituent boards to charge
the resident district tuition for pupils rather than to have the general education revenue paid to a
fiscal agent school district. Except as provided in paragraph (d) or (e), the district of residence must
pay tuition equal to at least 90 percent of the district average general education revenue per pupil
unit minus an amount equal to the product of the formula allowance according to section 126C.10,

     Subd. 5. Obligations. Nothing in this section alleviates the obligations under section 120A.22.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 120B.02, is amended to read:
     120B.02 EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS FOR MINNESOTA'S STUDENTS.
    (a) The legislature is committed to establishing rigorous academic standards for Minnesota's
public school students. To that end, the commissioner shall adopt in rule statewide academic
standards. The commissioner shall not prescribe in rule or otherwise the delivery system, classroom
assessments, or form of instruction that school sites must use. For purposes of this chapter, a school
site is a separate facility, or a separate program within a facility that a local school board recognizes
as a school site for funding purposes.
     (b) All commissioner actions regarding the rule must be premised on the following:
1568                                      JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                            [30TH DAY

      (1) the rule is intended to raise academic expectations for students, teachers, and schools;
      (2) any state action regarding the rule must evidence consideration of school district autonomy;
and
    (3) the Department of Education, with the assistance of school districts, must make available
information about all state initiatives related to the rule to students and parents, teachers, and the
general public in a timely format that is appropriate, comprehensive, and readily understandable.
   (c) When fully implemented, the requirements for high school graduation in Minnesota must
require students to satisfactorily complete, as determined by the school district, the course credit
requirements under section 120B.024 and:   ­ successfully pass graduation examinations as required
under section 120B.30.

   Sec. 13. [120B.299] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section apply to this chapter.
   Subd. 2. Growth. "Growth" compares the difference in a student's achievement score at two or
more distinct points in time.
   Subd. 3. Value-added. "Value-added" is the amount of achievement a student demonstrates
above an established baseline. The difference between the student's score and the baseline defines
value-added.
1574                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [30TH DAY

    Subd. 4. Growth-based value-added. "Growth-based value-added" is based on a student's
growth score. In a growth-based value-added system, the student's first test is the baseline, and the
difference between the student's first and next test scores within a defined period is the measure
of value-added.
     Subd. 5. Adequate yearly progress. A school or district makes "adequate yearly progress"
if, for every student subgroup under the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act in the school
or district, its proficiency index, based on statewide assessment scores, meets or exceeds federal
expectations. To make adequate yearly progress, the school or district also must satisfy applicable
federal requirements related to student attendance, graduation, and test participation rates.
    Subd. 6. State growth target. (a) "State growth target" is the average year-two assessment scores
for students with similar year-one assessment scores.
   (b) Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth target is benchmarked to 2006-2007
and 2007-2008 school year data until the assessment scale changes.
    (c) Each time before the assessment scale changes, a recognized Minnesota assessment group
composed of assessment and evaluation directors and staff and researchers must recommend a new
state growth target that the commissioner must consider when revising standards under section
120B.023, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 7. Low growth. "Low growth" is an assessment score one-half standard deviation below
the state growth target.
   Subd. 8. Medium growth. "Medium growth" is an assessment score within one-half standard
deviation above or below the state growth target.
   Subd. 9. High growth. "High growth" is an assessment score one-half standard deviation or
more above the state growth target.
    Subd. 10. Proficiency. "Proficiency" for purposes of reporting growth on school performance
report cards under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, means those students who, in the previous school
year, scored at or above "meets standards" on the statewide assessments under section 120B.30. Each
year, school performance report cards must separately display: (1) the numbers and percentages of
students who achieved low growth, medium growth, and high growth and achieved proficiency in
the previous school year; and (2) the numbers and percentages of students who achieved low growth,
medium growth, and high growth and did not achieve proficiency in the previous school year.
   Subd. 11. Growth and progress toward proficiency. The categories of low growth, medium
growth and high growth shall be used to indicate both growth, and progress toward grade-level
proficiency that is consistent with subdivision 10.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision

    (i) obtaining an achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the Minnesota comprehensive assessments in grade 10 for reading
and grade 11 for mathematics or achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting
process on the graduation-required assessment for diploma in grade 10 for reading and grade 11 for
mathematics or subsequent retests;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in reading and the mathematics test for English language
learners or the graduation-required assessment for diploma equivalent of those assessments for

proficiency in the context of the state's grade level academic standards. If a state assessment is not
available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript except as required in paragraph (f).
    (f) A school, district, or charter school must place a student's highest assessment score
for each of the following assessments on the student's high school transcript: the mathematics
Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment, reading Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment, and
writing Graduation-Required Assessment for Diploma, and when applicable, the mathematics
Graduation-Required Assessment for Diploma and reading Graduation-Required Assessment for
Diploma.

Indicators of achievement and prior achievement must be based on highly reliable statewide or
districtwide assessments. Indicators that take into account a student's prior achievement must
not be used to disregard a school's low achievement or to exclude a school from a program to
improve low achievement levels. T                     ­h

includes criteria for identifying schools and school districts that demonstrate medium and high
growth under section 120B.299. The system may be used to advance educators' professional
development and replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs. Data
on individual teachers generated under the model are personnel data under section 13.43. The
model must allow users to:
      (1) report student growth consistent with this paragraph; and
    (2) for all student categories with a cell size of at least 20, report and compare aggregated and
disaggregated state growth data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001
No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively.
   The commissioner must report separate measures of student growth and proficiency, consistent
with this paragraph.

   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­b
                   l­a­­e
                        l­­
                          , valid, replicated evidence showing that when these programs or practices
are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory reading progress. The
program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, instruction in five areas of reading:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and ­e   t­x­­
                                                                           t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
   (b) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read text with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
    (c) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
   (d) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships

between written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that
stresses learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and
spelling.
    (e) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.
    (f) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.

made to the Board of Teaching.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.18, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Teacher and support personnel qualifications. (a) The Board of Teaching must issue
licenses under its jurisdiction to persons the board finds to be qualified and competent for their
respective positions.
    (b) The board must require a person to successfully complete an examination of skills in
reading, writing, and mathematics before being granted an initial teaching license to provide direct
instruction to pupils in prekindergarten, elementary, secondary, or special education programs.
In addition, the board must require a person to successfully complete an assessment of reading
instruction consistent with subdivision 2c before being granted an initial teaching license to
provide explicit, sequential, and systematic instruction to pupils in prekindergarten or elementary
programs. The board must require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher
preparation program to provide remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component
to persons enrolled in their institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills
examination or an assessment of reading instruction, including those for whom English is a second
language. The colleges and universities must provide assistance in the specific academic areas of
deficiency in which the person did not achieve a qualifying score. School districts must provide
similar, appropriate, and timely remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component
and mentoring to those persons employed by the district who completed their teacher education
program outside the state of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach in Minnesota and did
not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English
is a second language. The Board of Teaching shall report annually to the education committees of
the legislature on the total number of teacher candidates during the most recent school year taking
the skills examination, the number who achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the number
who do not achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the distribution of all candidates' scores,
the number of candidates who have taken the examination at least once before, and the number of
candidates who have taken the examination at least once before and achieve a qualifying score.
    (c) A person who has completed an approved teacher preparation program and obtained a
one-year license to teach, but has not successfully completed the skills examination, may renew
the one-year license for two additional one-year periods. Each renewal of the one-year license is
contingent upon the licensee:
   (1) providing evidence of participating in an approved remedial assistance program provided
by a school district or postsecondary institution that includes a formal diagnostic component in the
specific areas in which the licensee did not obtain qualifying scores; and
    (2) attempting to successfully complete the skills examination during the period of each one-year
license.
   (d) The Board of Teaching must grant continuing licenses only to those persons who have met
board criteria for granting a continuing license, which includes successfully completing the skills
examination in reading, writing, and mathematics.
    (e) All colleges and universities approved by the board of teaching to prepare persons for teacher
licensure must include in their teacher preparation programs a common core of teaching knowledge
and skills to be acquired by all persons recommended for teacher licensure. This common core

previously qualified to participate in the alternative teacher professional pay system under this
section is no longer in compliance with the program's requirements under this section and section
122A.413, the commissioner may not cancel a school district's participation in the middle of a
school year. The commissioner must notify the district 30 days prior to the end of the district's
school year if the commissioner intends to end a district's participation in the program for the
subsequent school year. The school district must be given the opportunity to correct its compliance
with this section and section 122A.413 before the district's participation in the program is ended
in the subsequent school year.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to

charter school with a plan approved under section 122A.414, subdivisions 2a and 2b, if the recipient
is a charter school equals $260 times the number of pupils enrolled in the school on October 1 of the
previous fiscal year, or on October 1 of the current fiscal year for a charter school in the first year
of operation, times the ratio of the sum of the alternative teacher compensation aid and alternative
teacher compensation levy for all participating school districts to the maximum alternative teacher
compensation revenue for those districts under subdivision 1.
    (b) Notwithstanding subdivision 1, the state total basic alternative teacher compensation aid
entitlement must not exceed $75,636,000 for fiscal year 2007 and later. The commissioner must
limit the amount of alternative teacher compensation aid approved under this section so as not to
exceed these limits.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 5. Alternative teacher compensation levy. For fiscal year 2011 and later, the alternative
teacher compensation levy for a district receiving basic alternative teacher compensation aid equals
the product of (1) the difference between the district's alternative teacher compensation revenue and
the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid times (2) the lesser of one or the ratio of the
district's adjusted net tax capacity per adjusted pupil unit to $5,913.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to

    Subd. 6. Alternative teacher compensation equalization aid. (a) For fiscal year 2011 and
later, a district's alternative teacher compensation equalization aid equals the district's alternative
teacher compensation revenue minus the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid minus
the district's alternative teacher compensation levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted, the alternative teacher compensation equalization aid must be reduced in proportion to
the actual amount levied.
    (b) A district's alternative teacher compensation aid equals the sum of the district's basic
alternative teacher compensation aid and the district's alternative teacher compensation equalization
aid.
   Sec. 41. [122A.4155] ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION APPLICATION GRANTS.
    Subdivision 1. Reallocation. By June 1, 2011, and each year thereafter, the unexpended
alternative compensation aid, under sections 122.415, subdivision 4, and 126C.10, subdivision
34, from the prior fiscal year must be reallocated to eligible school districts to help districts pay
for the costs associated with applying to participate in the alternative compensation program. The
commissioner must reallocate the unexpended alternative compensation aid as grants by June 30,
2011, and each year thereafter. The Department of Finance and Department of Education shall
continue to forecast the alternative compensation aid, under section 122A.415, subdivision 4. On
November 15, 2012, and each year thereafter, the Department of Education must certify the amount
of aid that is available to be reallocated to grants under this section. The Department of Education
may make a reasonable estimate to prorate grants under this section to ensure that sufficient funding
is available to fully fund the forecasted aid under section 122A.415, subdivision 4.
   Subd. 2. Eligibility. School districts located in greater Minnesota that have submitted a letter of

intent and begun the transitional planning year, under section 122A.414, subdivision 1a, are eligible
for alternative compensation application grants. For the purposes of this section, an eligible school
district is any school district located in the rural equity region, under section 126C.10, subdivision
28.
    Subd. 3. Awards. The commissioner of education must reallocate available aid to eligible school
districts to encourage participation in the alternative compensation program. The commissioner may
establish criteria to select greater Minnesota school districts. School districts that receive grants
under this section must be given priority for full participation in alternative compensation program
in the subsequent year.
   Subd. 4. Restriction. A school district that receives a grant under subdivision 3, must use the
grant to facilitate the district's progress toward full participation in the alternative compensation
program. The commissioner may establish reasonable restrictions on the use of the grant funds to
encourage full participation in the alternative compensation program.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.60, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Effective staff development activities. (a) Staff development activities must:
   (1) focus on the school classroom and research-based strategies that improve student learning;
   (2) provide opportunities for teachers to practice and improve their instructional skills over time;
    (3) provide opportunities for teachers to use student data as part of their daily work to increase
student achievement;
   (4) enhance teacher content knowledge and instructional skills;
   (5) align with state and local academic standards;
    (6) provide opportunities to build professional relationships, foster collaboration among
principals and staff who provide instruction, and provide opportunities for teacher-to-teacher
mentoring; and
   (7) align with the plan of the district or site for an alternative teacher professional pay system.
Staff development activities may include curriculum development and curriculum training
programs, ­ an
             ­d­ activities that provide teachers and other members of site-based teams training to
enhance team performance, and basic first aid, including CPR and the use of automatic external
defibrillators with an option for certification. The school district also may implement other
staff development activities required by law and activities associated with professional teacher
compensation models.
    (b) Release time provided for teachers to supervise students on field trips and school activities,
or independent tasks not associated with enhancing the teacher's knowledge and instructional skills,
such as preparing report cards, calculating grades, or organizing classroom materials, may not be
counted as staff development time that is financed with staff development reserved revenue under
section 122A.61.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.61, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
1594                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [30TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Staff development revenue. A district is required to reserve an amount equal
to at least two percent of the basic revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 2, for in-service
education for programs under section 120B.22, subdivision 2, for staff development plans,
including plans for challenging instructional activities and experiences under section 122A.60, and
for curriculum development and programs, other in-service education, teachers' workshops, teacher
conferences, the cost of substitute teachers staff development purposes, preservice and in-service
education for special education professionals and paraprofessionals, and other related costs for
staff development efforts. A district may annually waive the requirement to reserve their basic
revenue under this section if a majority vote of the licensed teachers in the district and a majority
vote of the school board agree to a resolution to waive the requirement. A district in statutory
operating debt is exempt from reserving basic revenue according to this section. Districts may
expend an additional amount of unreserved revenue for staff development based on their needs.
With the exception of amounts reserved for staff development from revenues allocated directly
to school sites and any amounts spent for first aid or CPR and automatic external defibrillator
training, the board must initially allocate 50 percent of the remaining reserved revenue to each
school site in the district on a per teacher basis, which must be retained by the school site until
used. The board may retain 25 percent to be used for district wide staff development efforts. The
remaining 25 percent of the revenue must be used to make grants to school sites for best practices
methods. A grant may be used for any purpose authorized under section 120B.22, subdivision 2,
122A.60, or for the costs of curriculum development and programs, other in-service education,
teachers' workshops, teacher conferences, substitute teachers for staff development purposes, and
other staff development efforts, and determined by the site professional development team. The
site professional development team must demonstrate to the school board the extent to which staff
at the site have met the outcomes of the program. The board may withhold a portion of initial
allocation of revenue if the staff development outcomes are not being met.

    Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.03, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Background check required. (a) A school hiring authority shall request a
criminal history background check from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
on all individuals who are offered employment in a school and on all individuals, except enrolled
student volunteers, who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other
extracurricular academic coaching services to a school, regardless of whether any compensation
is paid. In order for an individual to be eligible for employment or to provide the services, the
individual must provide an executed criminal history consent form and a money order or check
payable to either the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension or the school hiring authority, at the
discretion of the school hiring authority, in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension and the school district of conducting the criminal history background
check. A school hiring authority deciding to receive payment may, at its discretion, accept payment

in the form of a negotiable instrument other than a money order or check and shall pay the
superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension directly to conduct the background check.
The superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall conduct the background check by
retrieving criminal history data maintained in the criminal justice information system computers.
A school hiring authority, at its discretion, may decide not to request a criminal history background
check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by the State Board of Teaching
or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual. A school hiring authority may decide to pay the costs of conducting a background check
under this paragraph. If the school hiring authority pays the costs, the individual who is the subject
of the background check need not pay for it.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
  (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal

history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Budgets; form of notification. (a) Every board must publish revenue and
expenditure budgets for the current year and the actual revenues, expenditures, fund balances
for the prior year and projected fund balances for the current year in a form prescribed by the
commissioner within one week of the acceptance of the final audit by the board, or November 30,
whichever is earlier. The forms prescribed must be designed so that year to year comparisons of
revenue, expenditures and fund balances can be made.
    (b) A school board annually must notify the public of its revenue, expenditures, fund balances,
and other relevant budget information. The board must include the budget information required by
this section in the materials provided as a part of its truth in taxation hearing, post the materials in
a conspicuous place on the district's official Web site, including a link to the district's school report
card on the Department of Education's Web site, and publish a summary of the information in a
qualified newspaper of general circulation in the district.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and

no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
      (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
      (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;

                             l­n
the course syllabus in a format established by the commissioner that identifies the state standards met
by the course, content outline, assessment requirements, expectations for actual teacher contact time,
other student-to-teacher communication, and academic support for supplemental online courses
taken by students in the enrolling district. Within 15 days after the online learning provider makes
information in this paragraph available to the enrolling district, the enrolling district must either
confirm or deny to the online provider that the student, parent or guardian, and enrolling district
have agreed the courses meet the enrolling district's graduation requirements. An online learning
course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation standard or grade progression requirements at
the enrolling district as demonstrated on the online provider's syllabus must be considered to meet
the corresponding graduation requirements of the student in the enrolling district. A student may
enroll in supplemental online learning courses up to the midpoint of the enrolling district's term.
The enrolling district may waive this requirement for special circumstances and upon acceptance
by the online provider.
   (c) An online learning provider must notify the commissioner that it is delivering online learning
and report the number of online learning students it is accepting and the online learning courses and
programs it is delivering.
    (d) An online learning provider may limit enrollment if the provider's school board or board of
directors adopts by resolution specific standards for accepting and rejecting students' applications.
  (e) An enrolling district may reduce an online learning student's regular classroom instructional
membership in proportion to the student's membership in online learning courses.
    (f) The online provider must report or make available individual student progress and credit
accumulation to the student, parent or guardian, and enrolling district in a manner specified by the
commissioner unless another manner is agreed upon by the enrolling district and the online provider
and submitted to the commissioner. The enrolling district must designate a contact person to assist
in the facilitation and monitoring of student progress and credit accumulation towards graduation
status.
     Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.095, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Online learning parameters. (a) An online learning student must receive academic
credit for completing the requirements of an online learning course or program. Secondary
credits granted to an online learning student must be counted toward the graduation and credit
requirements of the enrolling district. A               ­­n­­o

The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online
learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students.
If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation
standard or grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement
is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or
courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03,
subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning student

in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online learning
provider that is not the enrolling district.
      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for payment of any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.
    (d) An enrolling district may offer online learning to its enrolled students. Such online learning
does not generate online learning funds under this section. An enrolling district that offers online
learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the reporting requirements or review criteria
under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district is a full-time online provider. A teacher with a
Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to enrolled students receiving online
learning from an enrolling district . The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts
with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The
instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota
license.

teacher with a Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students.
The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and
receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum
developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants
a waiver, a teacher providing online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in
any one online learning course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply for enrollment to an approved full-time online learning program following
appropriate procedures in subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll
in classes at a local school per contract for instructional services between the online learning provider
and the school district.

all courses meet state academic standards, and that the online learning curriculum, instruction and
assessment, expectations for actual teacher contact time or other student-to-teacher communication,
and academic support meet nationally recognized professional standards and are demonstrated as
such in a syllabus provided according to the commissioner's requirements. Once an online learning
provider is approved under this paragraph, all of its online learning course offerings are eligible
for payment under this section unless a course is successfully challenged by an enrolling district
or the department under paragraph (b).
    (b) An enrolling district may challenge the validity of a course offered by an online learning
provider. The department must review such challenges based on the certification procedures under
paragraph (a). The department may initiate its own review of the validity of an online learning course
offered by an online learning provider.
    (c) The department may collect a fee not to exceed $250 for certifying online learning providers
or $50 per course for reviewing a challenge by an enrolling district.
   (d) The department must develop, publish, and maintain a list of approved online learning
providers and online learning courses and programs that it has reviewed and certified.

provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan.
    (c) An eligible sponsor under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval
as a sponsor before submitting an affidavit to the commissioner to sponsor a charter school. The
application for approval as a charter school sponsor must demonstrate the applicant's ability
to implement the procedures and satisfy the criteria for sponsoring a charter school under this
section. The commissioner must approve or disapprove an application within 60 business days
of the application deadline. If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner
must notify the applicant of the deficiencies and the applicant then has 20 business days to
address the deficiencies to the commissioner's satisfaction. Failing to address the deficiencies to
the commissioner's satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be a sponsor. The affidavit to be
submitted to and evaluated by the commissioner must include at least the following:
   (1) how sponsoring schools is a way for the organization to carry out its mission;
    (2) a description of the capacity of the organization to serve as a sponsor, including the personnel

   (v) the financial management plan; and
   (vi) the administration and operations plan;
    (4) a description of the type of contract it will arrange with the schools it sponsors that meets
the provisions of subdivision 6 and defines the rights and responsibilities of the charter school for
governing its educational program, controlling its funds, and making school management decisions;
   (5) the process to be used for providing ongoing oversight of the school consistent with the
contract expectations specified in clause (4) that assures that the schools sponsored are complying
with both the provisions of applicable law and rules, and with the contract;
   (6) the process for making decisions regarding the renewal or termination of the school's charter
based on evidence that demonstrates the academic, organizational, and financial competency of the
school, including its success in increasing student achievement and meeting the goals of the charter
school agreement; and
    (7) an assurance specifying that the organization is committed to serving as a sponsor for the
full five-year term.
   (d) The sponsor must participate in department-approved training.
    (e) A sponsor that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2011, to
the commissioner for approval, under paragraph (c), to continue as a sponsor under this section. For
purposes of this paragraph, a sponsor that fails to submit a timely application is ineligible to charter
a school.
    (f) The commissioner shall review a sponsor's performance every five years in a manner and
form determined by the commissioner and may review a sponsor's performance more frequently at
the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator, charter school board
member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the review, shall transmit a
report with findings to the sponsor. If, consistent with this section, the commissioner finds that a
sponsor has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the commissioner may subject the sponsor
to corrective action, which may include terminating the contract with the charter school board of
directors of a school it sponsored. The commissioner must notify the sponsor in writing of any
findings that may subject the sponsor to corrective action and the sponsor then has 15 business days
to request an informal hearing before the commissioner takes corrective action.
    (g) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against a sponsor, including
terminating a sponsor's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the sponsor;

       ­­  . A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board election dates at least 30
          ­­
days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.
    (e) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management standards and practices. A board member who does not begin the required training
within three months of being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being
seated on the board is ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (f) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
The charter school board of directors shall be composed of at least five members who are not related
parties and shall include at least a licensed teacher employed at the school, a charter school parent
or legal guardian, and an interested community member. The chief financial officer and the chief
administrator are nonvoting board members. Board bylaws shall outline the process and procedures
for changing the board's governance model. A board may change its governance model within the
requirements of board membership in this section and only with approval from the sponsor and a
voting majority of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed at the school.

    (j) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the sponsor of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the sponsor then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school shall not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.

or in a district dissolved under section 123A.46 for at least 36 months after the date of consolidation
or dissolution, except under subdivision 5 in this section or unless the school board of the school
district in which the charter school would be located gives the sponsor written approval to do so.
    (l) A new charter school must not open within a one-mile radius of a public school that has
closed under section 123B.51 for at least 36 months after the date the school closed unless the
commissioner determines that the new charter school applicant does not intend to reestablish the
closed public school as a charter school, except under subdivision 5 in this section or unless the
school board of the school district in which the charter school would be located gives the sponsor
written approval to do so.
     (m) A sponsor may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from paragraph (k) or paragraph
(l). The commissioner must use the criteria in this section to approve or deny the waiver within 45
business days. The commissioner's decision is final.

this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the sponsor who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision

department, the state of Minnesota or a local law enforcement agency information about the school's
financial circumstances, educational performance, a conflict of interest, or other violation of law or
school policy. The charter school board of directors must enter into a written agreement with each
teacher that outlines the terms and conditions of employment.

                             t­ June 30 of a school year, for the payment periods occurring after the school
has ceased serving students, the commissioner shall withhold state aid due to the school based on
estimated state aid entitlements. The charter school board of directors and sponsor must provide
the commissioner with a closure plan under chapter 308A or 317A, and financial information that
details the school's liabilities and assets. After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an
audit of pupil counts, and documentation of lease expenditures, and monitoring special education
expenditures, the commissioner may release cash withheld and may continue regular payments
up to the current year payment percentages if further amounts are due. If, based on audits and
monitoring, the school received state aid in excess of the amount due, the commissioner shall retain
cash withheld sufficient to eliminate the aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations
prior to, or at the end of, a school year, notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary
final payments may be made after receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of
special education expenditures, ­         an
                                           ­d ­ documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of
Uniform Financial Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year
of operation. Final payment may be made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section
123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount
of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If a charter school, within the timeline under section 471.425, fails to pay a school district,
intermediate school district, education cooperative, or the state after receiving an undisputed invoice
for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid sufficient to satisfy
the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the school district, intermediate school district,
or service cooperative. A school district, intermediate school district, education cooperative, or
a representative of the state shall notify the commissioner when a charter school fails to pay an
undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it received the original invoice.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.

    (d
     ­­) (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the
department and a quarterly report to the Department of Education. The report must list each student
by grade, show the student's start and end dates, if any, with the charter school, and for any student
participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar
quarter to the department. The department must develop a Web-based reporting form for charter
schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in

    (b) A school district or charter school may be approved biennially by the state to provide
additional instructional programming that results in grade level acceleration. The program must
be designed so that students make grade progress during the school year and graduate prior to the
students' peers.

demonstrate to the commissioner that it will:
    (1) provide a program of instruction that permits pupils to receive instruction throughout the
entire year; and
    (2) develop and maintain a separate record system that, for purposes of section 126C.05, permits
identification of membership attributable to pupils participating in the program. The record system
and identification must ensure that the program will not have the effect of increasing the total average
daily membership attributable to an individual pupil as a result of a learning year program. The
record system must include the date the pupil originally enrolled in a learning year program, the
pupil's grade level, the date of each grade promotion, the average daily membership generated in
each grade level, the number of credits or standards earned, and the number needed to graduate.
    (d) A student who has not completed a school district's graduation requirements may continue
to enroll in courses the student must complete in order to graduate until the student satisfies the
district's graduation requirements or the student is 21 years old, whichever comes first.

alternative program must inform all pupils and their parents about the learning year program and
that participation in the program is optional. A continual learning plan must be developed at least
annually for each pupil with the participation of the pupil, parent or guardian, teachers, and other
staff; each participant must sign and date the plan. The plan must specify the learning experiences
that must occur during the entire fiscal year and are necessary for grade progression or, for secondary
students, graduation. The plan must include:

    (1) the pupil's learning objectives and experiences, including courses or credits the pupil plans
to complete each year and, for a secondary pupil, the graduation requirements the student must
complete;
      (2) the assessment measurements used to evaluate a pupil's objectives;
      (3) requirements for grade level or other appropriate progression; and
   (4) for pupils generating more than one average daily membership in a given grade, an indication
of which objectives were unmet.
The plan may be modified to conform to district schedule changes. The district may not modify the
plan if the modification would result in delaying the student's time of graduation.

pupil in the district to 1,020 for a secondary pupil; (ii) the greater of 935 hours or the number of
hours required for a full-time elementary pupil in the district to 935 for an elementary pupil in
grades 1 through 6; and (iii) the greater of 425 hours or the number of hours required for a full-time
kindergarten student without a disability in the district to 425 for a kindergarten student without a
disability. Hours that occur after the close of the instructional year in June shall be attributable to the
following fiscal year. A kindergarten student must not be counted as more than 1.2 pupils in average
daily membership under this subdivision. A student in grades 1 through 12 must not be counted as
more than 1.2 pupils in average daily membership under this subdivision.

    Subd. 20. Project-based average daily membership. (a) Project-based is an instructional
program where students complete coursework for credit at an individual pace that is primarily
student-led and may be completed on site, in the community, or online. A project-based program

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 121A.41, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
      Subd. 10. Suspension. "Suspension" means an action by the school administration, under rules
promulgated by the school board, prohibiting a pupil from attending school for a period of no
more than ten school days. If a suspension is longer than five days, the suspending administrator
must provide the superintendent with a reason for the longer suspension. This definition does
not apply to dismissal from school for one school day or less, except as provided in federal
law for a student with a disability. Each suspension action may include a readmission plan.
The readmission plan shall include, where appropriate, a provision for implementing alternative
educational services upon readmission and may not be used to extend the current suspension.
Consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5, the readmission plan must not obligate a parent
to provide a sympathomimetic medication for the parent's child as a condition of readmission. The
school administration may not impose consecutive suspensions against the same pupil for the same
course of conduct, or incident of misconduct, except where the pupil will create an immediate
and substantial danger to self or to surrounding persons or property, or where the district is in
the process of initiating an expulsion, in which case the school administration may extend the
suspension to a total of 15 school days. ­                            In­­­

      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 121A.43, is amended to read:
      121A.43 EXCLUSION AND EXPULSION OF PUPILS WITH A DISABILITY.
    (a) Consistent with federal law governing days of removal and section 121A.46, school
personnel may suspend a child with a disability. When a child with a disability has been suspended
for more than five consecutive school days or 10 cumulative school days in the same school year,
and that suspension does not involve a recommendation for expulsion or exclusion or other change
of placement under federal law, relevant members of the child's individualized education program
team, including at least one of the child's teachers, shall meet and determine the extent the child
needs services in order to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in
another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals in the child's individualized education
program. That meeting must occur as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days after the sixth
consecutive day of suspension or the tenth cumulative day of suspension has elapsed.
   (b) A dismissal for one school day or less is a day of suspension if the child with a disability
does not receive regular or special education instruction during that dismissal period. The notice
requirements under section 121A.46 do not apply to a dismissal of one day or less.
   (c) A child with a disability shall be provided alternative educational services to the extent a
suspension exceeds five consecutive school days.
     (d) Before initiating an expulsion or exclusion under sections 121A.40 to 121A.56, the district,
relevant members of the child's individualized education program team, and the child's parent
shall, consistent with federal law, determine whether the child's behavior was caused by or had a
direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability and whether the child's conduct was a
direct result of a failure to implement the child's individualized education program. When a p                                                    ­­

nurses for educating students through direct and indirect instruction;
    (2) consistent and uniform access to effective education programs for students with disabilities
throughout the state;
    (3) reduced inequalities and conflict, appropriate due process hearing procedures and reduced
court actions related to the delivery of special education instruction and services for students with
disabilities;
        (4) clear expectations for service providers and for students with disabilities;
    (5) increased accountability for all individuals and agencies that provide instruction and other
services to students with disabilities;

    (6) greater focus for the state and local resources dedicated to educating students with
disabilities; and
    (7) clearer standards for evaluating the effectiveness of education and support services for
students with disabilities.
    (c) Subject to chapter 14, the commissioner may adopt, amend, or rescind a rule related to

PROGRAMS.
   (a) At the beginning of each school year, each school district shall have in effect, for each child
with a disability, an individualized education program.
   (b) As defined in this section, every district must ensure the following:
    (1) all students with disabilities are provided the special instruction and services which are
appropriate to their needs. Where the individual education plan team has determined appropriate
goals and objectives based on the student's needs, including the extent to which the student can
be included in the least restrictive environment, and where there are essentially equivalent and
effective instruction, related services, or assistive technology devices available to meet the student's
needs, cost to the district may be among the factors considered by the team in choosing how to
provide the appropriate services, instruction, or devices that are to be made part of the student's
individual education plan. The individual education plan team shall consider and may authorize
services covered by medical assistance according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 26. The
student's needs and the special education instruction and services to be provided must be agreed
upon through the development of an individual education plan. The plan must address the student's
need to develop skills to live and work as independently as possible within the community. The
individual education plan team must consider positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and
supports that address behavior for children with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. B ­y­ During grade 9 ­  o­r­

                                                           ­, the plan must address the student's needs
for transition from secondary services to postsecondary education and training, employment,
community participation, recreation, and leisure and home living. In developing the plan, districts
must inform parents of the full range of transitional goals and related services that should be
considered. The plan must include a statement of the needed transition services, including a
statement of the interagency responsibilities or linkages or both before secondary services are
concluded;
   (2) children with a disability under age five and their families are provided special instruction
and services appropriate to the child's level of functioning and needs;
    (3) children with a disability and their parents or guardians are guaranteed procedural safeguards
and the right to participate in decisions involving identification, assessment including assistive
technology assessment, and educational placement of children with a disability;
    (4) eligibility and needs of children with a disability are determined by an initial assessment
or reassessment, which may be completed using existing data under United States Code, title 20,
section 33, et seq.;

    (5) to the maximum extent appropriate, children with a disability, including those in public or
private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and
that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with a disability from the
regular educational environment occurs only when and to the extent that the nature or severity of
the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services cannot
be achieved satisfactorily;
    (6) in accordance with recognized professional standards, testing and evaluation materials, and
procedures used for the purposes of classification and placement of children with a disability are
selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory; and
   (7) the rights of the child are protected when the parents or guardians are not known or not
available, or the child is a ward of the state.
   ­
   (b
    ­­) (c) For paraprofessionals employed to work in programs for students with disabilities, the
school board in each district shall ensure that:
    (1) before or immediately upon employment, each paraprofessional develops sufficient
knowledge and skills in emergency procedures, building orientation, roles and responsibilities,
confidentiality, vulnerability, and reportability, among other things, to begin meeting the needs of
the students with whom the paraprofessional works;
    (2) annual training opportunities are available to enable the paraprofessional to continue
to further develop the knowledge and skills that are specific to the students with whom the
paraprofessional works, including understanding disabilities, following lesson plans, and
implementing follow-up instructional procedures and activities; and
    (3) a districtwide process obligates each paraprofessional to work under the ongoing direction
of a licensed teacher and, where appropriate and possible, the supervision of a school nurse.
    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.091, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Additional requirements for prior written notice. In addition to federal
requirements, a prior written notice shall:
   (1) inform the parent that except for the initial placement of a child in special education, the
school district will proceed with its proposal for the child's placement or for providing special
education services unless the child's parent notifies the district of an objection within 14 days of
when the district sends the prior written notice to the parent; and
   (2) state that a parent who objects to a proposal or refusal in the prior written notice may request
a conciliation conference under subdivision 7 or another alternative dispute resolution procedure
under subdivision 8 or 9.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.091, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Conciliation conference. A parent must have an opportunity to meet with appropriate
district staff in at least one conciliation conference if the parent objects to any proposal of which the
parent receives notice under subdivision 2         ­ 3a. ­I­ f­­h

portion of the dispute, or agree to use another procedure to resolve the dispute, the mediator shall
ensure that the resolution or agreement is in writing, signed by the parties, and a copy is given to
each party. The written resolution or agreement shall state that all discussions that occurred during
mediation are confidential and may not be used as evidence in any hearing or civil proceeding. The
resolution or agreement is legally binding upon the parties and is enforceable in the state or federal
district court. A party may request another mediation to resolve a dispute over implementing the
mediated agreement.
      Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.091, subdivision 12, is amended to read:

                                                    ) A parent or a district is entitled to an impartial
due process hearing conducted by the state when a dispute arises over the identification, evaluation,
educational placement, manifestation determination, interim alternative educational placement, or
the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability. The hearing must
be held in the district responsible for ensuring that a free appropriate public education is provided
according to state and federal law. The proceedings must be recorded and preserved, at state expense,
pending ultimate disposition of the action. The parent and the district shall receive, at state expense,
a copy of the hearing transcript or recording and the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusion of
law, and decisions.

(a) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a due process hearing regarding a
proposal or refusal to initiate or change that child's evaluation, individualized education program,
or educational placement, or to provide a free appropriate public education.
    (b) The parent shall include in the hearing request the name of the child, the address of the child's
residence, the name of the school the child attends, a description of the child's problem relating to
the proposed or refused initiation or change, including facts relating to the problem, and a proposed
resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the parents at the time.
     (c) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a hearing under United States Code,
title 20, section 1415, paragraph (k).
30TH DAY]                                                 FRIDAY, APRIL 3, 2009                                                                       1645

    (d) A parent or school district filing a request for a hearing under this subdivision must provide
the request to the other party and a copy of the request to the department. Upon receiving a request
for a hearing, the department shall give to the child's parent a copy of the procedural safeguards
notice available to a parent under federal regulations.
    (e) (1) If the parent of a child with a disability files a written request for a hearing, and the
school district has not previously sent a written notice to the parent under subdivision 3a, regarding
the subject matter of the hearing request, the school district shall, within ten days of receiving the
hearing request, send to the child's parent a written explanation of why the school district proposed
or refused to take the action raised in the hearing request, a description of other options that the
individualized education program team considered and the reason why those options were rejected,
a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report that the school district used
as the basis for the proposed or refused action, and a description of the factors that are relevant to
the school district's proposal or refusal. A response by a school district under this subdivision does
not preclude the school district from asserting that the parent's request for a hearing is insufficient
under clause (2) of this paragraph; and
    (2) a hearing may not occur until the party requesting the hearing files a request that meets the
requirements of paragraph (b). The request under paragraph (b) is considered sufficient unless the
party receiving the request notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing within 15 days of
receiving the request that the receiving party believes the request does not meet the requirements of
paragraph (b). Within five days of receiving a notice under this subdivision, the hearing officer shall
determine whether the request meets the requirements under paragraph (b) and notify the parties.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (e), clause (1), the party receiving a request for a hearing
shall send to the party requesting the hearing a written response that addresses the issues raised in
the hearing request within ten days of receiving the request.

      i­g­ ensure that not later than 45 days after the 30-day period or the adjusted time periods under
federal regulations expire, the hearing officer reaches a final decision in the due process hearing and
transmits a copy of the decision to each party. A hearing officer, at the request of either party, may
grant specific extensions of time beyond the 45-day period under subdivision 18. The hearing officer
must conduct the oral arguments in a hearing at a time and place that is reasonably convenient to
the parents and child involved. A hearing officer is encouraged to accelerate the time line to 30 days
for a child under the age of three whose needs change rapidly and who requires quick resolution
of a dispute. A    ­­

     Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.15, is amended to read:
     125A.15 PLACEMENT IN ANOTHER DISTRICT; RESPONSIBILITY.
    The responsibility for special instruction and services for a child with a disability temporarily
placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
     (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
1648                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [30TH DAY

living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time
constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
     (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
f­
­a­ i­i
  c­l ­t
       ­y­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may
establish reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the
child placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­) (e).
However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be the
district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational program
in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­
                                                                                 c­

    ­
    (­
     e­
      ) (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.28, is amended to read:
   125A.28 STATE INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COUNCIL.
    An Interagency Coordinating Council of at least 17, but not more than 25 members is
established, in compliance with Public Law 108-446, section 641. The members must be
appointed by the governor. Council members must elect the council chair. The representative
of the commissioner may not serve as the chair. The council must be composed of at least five
parents, including persons of color, of children with disabilities under age 12, including at least
three parents of a child with a disability under age seven, five representatives of public or private
providers of services for children with disabilities under age five, including a special education
director, county social service director, local Head Start director, and a community health services
or public health nursing administrator, one member of the senate, one member of the house of
representatives, one representative of teacher preparation programs in early childhood-special
education or other preparation programs in early childhood intervention, at least one representative
of advocacy organizations for children with disabilities under age five, one physician who cares for
young children with special health care needs, one representative each from the commissioners of
commerce, education, health, human services, a representative from the state agency responsible
for child care, foster care, mental health, homeless coordinator of education of homeless children
and youth, and a representative from Indian health services or a tribal council. Section 15.059,
subdivisions 2 to 5, apply to the council. The council must meet at least quarterly.
    The council must address methods of implementing the state policy of developing and
implementing comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary interagency programs of early
intervention services for children with disabilities and their families.
   The duties of the council include recommending policies to ensure a comprehensive and
coordinated system of all state and local agency services for children under age five with disabilities
and their families. The policies must address how to incorporate each agency's services into a
unified state and local system of multidisciplinary assessment practices, individual intervention
plans, comprehensive systems to find children in need of services, methods to improve public
awareness, and assistance in determining the role of interagency early intervention committees.
    On the date that Minnesota Part C Annual Performance Report is submitted to the federal
Office of Special Education, the council must recommend to the governor and the commissioners
of education, health, human services, commerce, and employment and economic development
policies for a comprehensive and coordinated system.
   Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the State Interagency Coordinating Council

  125A.51 PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES; EDUCATION
AND TRANSPORTATION.
    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
1650                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [30TH DAY

or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When a nonresident district makes an emergency placement without first consulting with
the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice of the
emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision, which the
placing district must then provide.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­

                                        ­y­ program for the pupil. The resident district may establish
reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract
with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.

    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

commissioner may evaluate the proposals but may not issue a negative or unfavorable review and
comment under this section for a school facility based solely on acreage of the proposed school site.
    (b) If a school board proposes to renovate an existing school, the local school board retains the
authority to choose whether to renovate an existing school or to build a new school, regardless of
the acreage of the current school site or the cost of the renovation relative to the cost of building a
new school. The commissioner's evaluation of whether to replace a facility must not be based solely
upon the ratio of renovation costs to the cost of replacement.

the district to participate in a management assistance plan before conducting a review and comment
on the project.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.71, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Review and comment. A school district, a special education cooperative, or a
cooperative unit of government, as defined in section 123A.24, subdivision 2, must not initiate an
installment contract for purchase or a lease agreement, hold a referendum for bonds, nor solicit
bids for new construction, expansion, or remodeling of an educational facility that requires an
expenditure in excess of $500,000 per school site if it has a capital loan outstanding, or $1,400,000
per school site if it does not have a capital loan outstanding, prior to review and comment by the
commissioner. The commissioner may exempt a facility maintenance project funded with general
education aid and levy, alternative facilities bonding and levy program, or health and safety revenue
from this provision after reviewing a written request from a school district describing the scope of
work. A school board shall not separate portions of a single project into components to avoid the
requirements of this subdivision.

which decreases the dollar amount provided for support for operating purposes of public library
service below the amount provided by it for the second, or third preceding year, whichever is less.
For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 1, any funds provided under section 473.757,
subdivision 2, for extending library hours of operation shall not be considered amounts provided
by a city or county for support for operating purposes of public library service. This subdivision
shall not apply to participating cities or counties where the adjusted net tax capacity of that city

dollar amount by which support would be decreased if the reduction in support were made in direct
proportion to the decrease in adjusted net tax capacity.

sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 or credits under section 273.1384 is reduced after the city or county
has certified its levy payable in that year, it may reduce its local support by the lesser of:
   (1) ten percent; or
   (2) a percent equal to the ratio of the aid and credit reductions to the city's or county's revenue
base, based on aids certified for the current calendar year. For calendar year 2009 only, the reduction
under this paragraph shall be based on 2008 aid and credit reductions under the December 2008
unallotment, as well as any aid and credit reductions in calendar year 2009. For pay 2009 only, the
commissioner of revenue will calculate the reductions under this paragraph and certify them to the

    (c) For taxes payable in 2010 and later, in any payable year in which the total amounts certified
for city or county aids under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 are less than the total amounts paid
under those sections in the previous calendar year, a city or county may reduce its local support by
the lesser of:
   (1) ten percent; or
   (2) a percent equal to the ratio of:
    (i) the difference between (A) the sum of the aid it was paid under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014
and the credits it received under section 273.1398 in the previous calendar year and (B) the sum of
the aid it is certified to be paid in the current calendar year under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014
and the credits estimated to be paid under section 273.1398; to
    (ii) its revenue base for the previous year, based on aids actually paid in the previous calendar
year. The commissioner of revenue shall calculate the percent aid cut for each county and city under
this paragraph and certify the percentage cuts to the commissioner of education by August 1 of

shall reduce its support for public libraries below the minimum level specified in subdivision 1.

disparities distribution under section 276A.06, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), or 473F.08, subdivision
3, paragraph (a);
   (2) its aid under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 in the current calendar year; and

    119A.52 DISTRIBUTION OF APPROPRIATION.
    (a) The commissioner of education must distribute money appropriated for that purpose to
federally designated Head Start programs to expand services and to serve additional low-income
children. Migrant and Indian reservation programs must be initially allocated money based on the
programs' share of federal funds. The remaining money must be initially allocated to the remaining
local agencies based equally on the agencies' share of federal funds and on the proportion of
eligible children in the agencies' service area who are not currently being served. A Head Start
program must be funded at a per child rate equal to its contracted, federally funded base level at
the start of the fiscal year. For all agencies without a federal Early Head Start rate, the state average
federal cost per child for Early Head Start applies. In allocating funds under this paragraph, the
commissioner of education must assure that each Head Start program in existence in 1993 is
allocated no less funding in any fiscal year than was allocated to that program in fiscal year 1993.
Before paying money to the programs, the commissioner must notify each program of its initial
allocation,­ and how the money must be used,          ­ an

plan under section 119A.535. For any program that cannot utilize its full allocation at the beginning
of the fiscal year, the commissioner must reduce the allocation proportionately. Money available
after the initial allocations are reduced must be redistributed to eligible programs.

    (b) The commissioner must develop procedures to make payments to programs based upon the
number of children reported to be enrolled during the required time period of program operations.
Enrollment is defined by federal Head Start regulations. The procedures must include a reporting
schedule, corrective action plan requirements, and financial consequences to be imposed on
programs that do not meet full enrollment after the period of corrective action. Programs reporting
chronic underenrollment, as defined by the commissioner, will have their subsequent program year
allocation reduced proportionately. Funds made available by prorating payments and allocations to
programs with reported underenrollment will be made available to the extent funds exist to fully
enrolled Head Start programs through a form and manner prescribed by the department.
    (c) Programs with approved innovative initiatives that target services to high-risk populations,
including homeless families and families living in homeless shelters and transitional housing, are
exempt from the procedures in paragraph (b). This exemption does not apply to entire programs.
The exemption applies only to approved innovative initiatives that target services to high-risk
populations, including homeless families and families living in homeless shelters and transitional
housing.
   Sec. 3. [124D.082] PREKINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE 3 PROGRAM.

   (10) develop and identify student benchmarks aligned to state standards for students' continued
progress in kindergarten and grades 1 and 2; and
    (11) demonstrate commitment of and leadership by school principals to ensure the necessary
tools and systems are in place to support prekindergarten through grade 3 continuum.
    Subd. 3. Financing. School districts or charter schools that establish a program under
subdivision 1 may allocate revenues attributable to students in kindergarten through grade 3 to
support the program. If a school district has a provisional rating under section 124D.143, or
the program has been rated at a three-star or higher quality level under the quality rating and
improvement system as provided in section 124D.142, the program may accept prekindergarten
allowances under section 124D.143, to support the program for children aged three and four years.
The program may establish fees to support children aged three and four years.

1670                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [30TH DAY

    (a) There is established a quality rating and improvement system to ensure that Minnesota's
children have access to high-quality early learning and care programs in a range of settings so
that they are fully ready for kindergarten by 2020. Creation of a standards-based quality rating and
improvement system includes:
    (1) establishing an early care and education framework that improves quality opportunities
in order to improve the educational outcomes of children so that they are ready for school. The
framework shall be based on the Minnesota quality rating system rating tool and a common set of
child outcome standards and informed by evaluation results;
    (2) using the framework as a tool to increase the number of publicly funded and regulated early
learning and care services in both public and private market programs that are high quality. If a
program or provider chooses to participate, the program or provider will be rated and will receive
public funding associated with the rating. The state shall develop a plan to link future early learning
and care state funding to the framework in a manner that complies with federal requirements; and
    (3) using the framework to track progress toward statewide access to high-quality early learning
and care programs, progress toward the number of low-income children whose parents can access
quality programs, and progress toward increasing the number of children who are fully prepared to
enter kindergarten.
    (b) In planning and implementing a statewide quality rating and improvement system in
paragraph (a), the state shall assess the cost of administering and staffing the system and collecting
assessment and evaluation data of the early learning and care system, including ensuring children
are fully ready for kindergarten. This cost assessment shall be provided to the early childhood
learning education finance committees of the legislature by January 15, 2010.
    (c) Prior to the creation of a statewide quality rating and improvement system in paragraph (a),
the state shall employ the Minnesota quality rating system rating tool in use in fiscal year 2008 with
its modification as a result of the evaluation results of the pilot project.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 7. [124D.143] PREKINDERGARTEN FINANCE ALLOWANCES.
    Subdivision 1. Early childhood allowance locations. In fiscal year 2010 and later, the
commissioners of human services and education shall continue three prekindergarten exploratory
projects located in the city of St. Paul, Hennepin County, and Blue Earth County that are conducted
in partnership with the Minnesota Early Learning Foundation to promote children's school
readiness. In fiscal year 2011 and later, the commissioners of human services and education shall
establish additional prekindergarten projects to be conducted in partnership with the Minnesota
Early Learning Foundation to promote children's school readiness. In fiscal year 2011, the
additional prekindergarten project sites shall be located in Otter Tail County, Itasca County, St.
Louis County, and a consortium of Benton, Stearns, and Sherburne Counties.
    Subd. 2. Allowance eligibility. Parents or legal guardians with incomes less than or equal to
46 percent of the state median income are eligible to receive allowances to pay for their children's
education in a quality early education program, in an amount not to exceed $4,000 per child per
year. The allowance must be used during the 12 months following receipt of the allowance by the
claimant for a child who is age three or four on September 1 to pay for services designed to promote

school readiness in a quality early care and education setting. A claimant may use the allowance
to pay fees or charges associated with their child's education in a quality early care and education
setting. A quality setting is one that meets the standards in subdivision 3.
    Subd. 2a. Automatic eligibility. For the purpose of establishing eligibility for the
prekindergarten education allowance, the commissioners of education and human services must
accept children identified in other public funding eligibility processes, including, but not limited
to, public school programs, Head Start, and child care assistance programs. In addition, the
commissioners of education and human services must make a sample form available to providers
that can be used to determine potential eligible children. The commissioner must submit a
prekindergarten education allowance to an eligible child who used this automatic process.
   Subd. 3. Quality standards. (a) Until a quality rating and improvement system is established
under section 124D.142, a provider may satisfy the quality rating system requirements and be
deemed eligible to receive prekindergarten education allowances if the provider has received a
provisional quality rating system approval from either the Department of Human Services or the
Department of Education, or has received a three-star or higher qualify rating under the Minnesota
Early Learning Foundation quality rating system. An eligible participant must agree to accept a
prekindergarten allowance to pay for services.
    (b) A quality early care and education setting for this section is a service program that receives
a three-star or higher quality rating based on the quality rating and improvement system established
according to section 124D.142.
    (c) For the purposes of receiving a provisional quality rating, a child care program or provider
must be approved by the commissioner of human services and a school-based program or a Head
Start program must be approved by the commissioner of education. Programs and providers must
apply for approval in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioners. To receive approval,
the commissioners must determine that applicants:
   (1) use research-based curricula that are aligned with the education standards under section
120B.021, instruction, and child assessment instruments approved by the Department of Education
and the Department of Human Services, in consultation with the Minnesota Early Learning
Foundation;
    (2) provide a program of sufficient intensity and duration to improve the school readiness of
participating children;
   (3) provide opportunities for parent involvement; and
   (4) meet other research-based criteria determined necessary by the commissioners.

    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.522, is amended to read:
    124D.522 ADULT BASIC EDUCATION SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE GRANTS.
    (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the policy review task force under section 124D.521,
may make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide services that are not offered by a district
adult basic education program or that are supplemental to either the statewide adult basic education
program, or a district's adult basic education program. The commissioner may make grants for:
staff development for adult basic education teachers and administrators; training for volunteer
tutors; training, services, and materials for serving disabled students through adult basic education
programs; statewide promotion of adult basic education services and programs; development and
dissemination of instructional and administrative technology for adult basic education programs;
programs which primarily serve communities of color; adult basic education distance learning
projects, including television instruction programs; and other supplemental services to support the
mission of adult basic education and innovative delivery of adult basic education services.

    (b) The commissioner must establish eligibility criteria and grant application procedures. Grants
under this section must support services throughout the state, focus on educational results for
adult learners, and promote outcome-based achievement through adult basic education programs.
Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the commissioner may make grants under this section from the state
total adult basic education aid set aside for supplemental service grants under section 124D.531. Up
to one-fourth of the appropriation for supplemental service grants must be used for grants for adult
basic education programs to encourage and support innovations in adult basic education instruction
and service delivery. A grant to a single organization cannot exceed ­    $1

total supplemental services aid. Nothing in this section prevents an approved adult basic education
program from using state or federal aid to purchase supplemental services.
