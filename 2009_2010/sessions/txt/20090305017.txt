energy programs, energy-efficient appliances, and energy efficiency and conservation block grant
purposes.
   Sec. 2. WEATHERIZATION.
    (a) Existing providers of weatherization services must be fully utilized for stimulus-funded
activity before additional providers of weatherization services are added. Programs that include
rental units shall be developed, including developing procedures to streamline low-income rental
unit participation in programs. Priority shall be given to serving the largest number of new
weatherization clients consistent with federal eligibility requirements. Administrative costs for
increased program activity related to stimulus funding must be minimized and the use of contract

services maximized.
   (b) A variety of strategies must be used for stimulus funded weatherization, including, without
limitation:
   (1) neighborhood saturation on a multiprogram basis, including without limitation, utility
conservation programs, weatherization programs, and state and local government energy programs;
    (2) a quick fix component that provides a lower level of weatherization to a larger number of
residences at a lower cost than a more comprehensive weatherization package; and
   (3) a more complete weatherization package at a higher cost that would, to the extent practicable,
use funding from a number of programs.
  Sec. 3. LOCAL             GOVERNMENT            AND     SCHOOL        DISTRICT        BUILDING
RENOVATIONS.

stimulus funds with the public building enhanced energy-efficiency program under Minnesota
Statutes, section 216C.43. The Office of Energy Security shall prioritize lighting upgrades,
energy recommissioning, and other cost-effective energy projects that are ready for immediate
implementation. Energy-efficiency conservation block grants and state energy program funds may
be used to advance local public building enhanced energy-efficiency program projects by either
reducing energy bills during a savings repayment period or by decreasing the number of years for
payback of energy improvement investments. Stimulus funds may not exceed more than 25 percent
of the total project cost with the balance of funding provided by the local governmental unit or
school district, the local public building enhanced energy-efficiency program under Minnesota
Statutes, section 216C.43, or another local governmental unit or school district financing program
in conjunction with utility conservation investment program funds to the maximum extent possible.
The Office of Energy Security shall coordinate with the Department of Education in prioritizing
school district projects, consistent with the principles of statewide geographic distribution of
projects, optimized energy savings, and an improved learning environment for school children.

and procedures to select, fund, and implement projects using stimulus funds. The joint plan and
procedures shall prioritize lighting upgrades, energy recommissioning, and other cost-effective
energy projects that are ready for immediate implementation. Energy-efficiency conservation
block grants and state energy program funds may be used to advance public building enhanced
energy-efficiency program projects under Minnesota Statutes, section 16B.32, by either reducing
energy bills during a savings repayment period or decreasing the number of years for payback of
energy improvement investments, provided that stimulus funds do not exceed more than 25 percent
of the total project cost with the balance of funding provided through the state public building
enhanced energy-efficiency program, or other financing, including conservation investment
program funds to the maximum extent possible.

financing from the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, local lenders, or another housing-related
program.
   Sec. 6. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES.
    Stimulus funds shall be granted to local units of government, including without limitation, cities,
counties, and port authorities for use in developing and implementing demonstration programs to
provide for the design, financing, and installation of energy-efficiency improvements in commercial
and industrial facilities. The local government may use stimulus funds for all costs necessary
to design, develop, and implement a commercial/industrial program to fund energy-efficiency
improvements, including but not limited to the costs of administration, marketing and financing
related to due-diligence analyses, financing origination and servicing, training, measurement and
verification, and the local government shall use grant funds for loans, guarantees, bond financing,
shared savings agreements, grants, or other financing arrangements to pay all costs necessary to
the design, procurement, construction, and installation of energy-efficiency improvements.
   Sec. 7. APPLIANCE REPLACEMENT.
    To the extent consistent with federal law, the commissioner of commerce may utilize stimulus
funds to supplement and enhance the amount of rebates provided to residential utility customers
through a conservation investment program.
   Sec. 8. TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

obligations guaranteed by a federal home loan bank are considered exempt from federal taxation to
the same extent that they are exempt under section 3023 of Public Law 110-289;
    (2) the amount of income or sales and use taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year under this
chapter and the amount of taxes based on net income paid or sales and use taxes paid to any other
state or to any province or territory of Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section
63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but the addition may not be more than the amount by which
the itemized deductions as allowed under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the
amount of the standard deduction as defined in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the
purpose of this paragraph, the disallowance of itemized deductions under section 68 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, income or sales and use tax is the last itemized deduction disallowed;
   (3) the capital gain amount of a lump-sum distribution to which the special tax under section
1122(h)(3)(B)(ii) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Public Law 99-514, applies;
    (4) the amount of income taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year under this chapter and
taxes based on net income paid to any other state or any province or territory of Canada, to the
extent allowed as a deduction in determining federal adjusted gross income. For the purpose of
this paragraph, income taxes do not include the taxes imposed by sections 290.0922, subdivision 1,
paragraph (b), 290.9727, 290.9728, and 290.9729;
   (5) the amount of expense, interest, or taxes disallowed pursuant to section 290.10 other than
expenses or interest used in computing net interest income for the subtraction allowed under
subdivision 19b, clause (1);
    (6) the amount of a partner's pro rata share of net income which does not flow through to the
partner because the partnership elected to pay the tax on the income under section 6242(a)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code;
    (7) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;
   (8) 80 percent of the amount by which the deduction allowed by section 179 of the Internal
Revenue Code exceeds the deduction allowable by section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through December 31, 2003;
    (9) to the extent deducted in computing federal taxable income, the amount of the deduction
allowable under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (10) the exclusion allowed under section 139A of the Internal Revenue Code for federal subsidies
for prescription drug plans;
   (11) the amount of expenses disallowed under section 290.10, subdivision 2;

in the land conservation property tax law program under section 273.114, the property is not subject
to the additional taxes required under this subdivision or subdivision 9.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), when real property which is
being, or has been valued and assessed under this section no longer qualifies under subdivision
3, the portion no longer qualifying shall be subject to additional taxes, in the amount equal to
the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 4, and the amount
determined under subdivision 5. Provided, however, that the amount determined under subdivision
5 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property
at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision
5. Such additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the current year,
provided, however, that no interest or penalties shall be levied on such additional taxes if timely
paid, and provided further, that such additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the last
three years that the said property has been valued and assessed under this section.
   (b) Real property that has been valued and assessed under this section prior to May 29, 2008,
and that ceases to qualify under this section after May 28, 2008, and before January 1, 2010, is not
subject to additional taxes under this subdivision or subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
   Sec. 4. [273.114] LAND CONSERVATION PROPERTY TAX.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) In this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have the
meanings given them.
    (b) "Conservation management plan" means a written document providing a framework
for site-specific healthy, productive, and sustainable conservation resources. A conservation
management plan must include at least the following:
   (1) conservation management goals for the land;
   (2) a reliable field inventory of the individual conservation cover types;
   (3) a description of the soil type and quality;
    (4) an aerial photo or map of the vegetation and other natural features of the land clearly
indicating the boundaries of the conservation land;
   (5) the proposed future conditions of the land;
   (6) prescriptions to meet proposed future conditions of the land;
   (7) a recommended timetable for implementing the prescribed activities; and
   (8) a legal description of the land encompassing the parcels included in the plan.
   (c) "Approved plan writers" are natural resource professionals who are self-employed, employed
by private companies or individuals, nonprofit organizations, local units of government, or public
agencies, and who are approved by the Board of Water and Soil Resources. Persons employed to
write conservation plans for soil and water conservation districts or federal agencies shall be deemed

to meet the standards required under this subdivision. The Board of Water and Soil Resources shall
issue a unique identification number to each approved planner.
   (d) All management activities prescribed in a plan must be in accordance with the recommended
conservation management guidelines. The commissioner of natural resources shall provide a
framework for plan content and updating and revising plans.
    Subd. 2. Requirements. Class 2b property that had been subject to Minnesota Statutes 2006,
section 273.111, or that is part of an agricultural homestead under section 273.13, subdivision 23,
paragraph (a), is entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this section if:
   (1) the land consists of at least ten acres;
    (2) a conservation management plan for the land must be prepared by an approved plan writer
and implemented during the period in which the land is subject to valuation and deferment under
this section;
   (3) conservation management guidelines must be used in conjunction with any conservation
management activities conducted on the land during the period in which the land is subject to
valuation and deferment under this section;
   (4) the land must be enrolled for a minimum of eight years; and
   (5) there are no delinquent property taxes on the land.
   Real estate may not be enrolled for valuation and deferment under this section and section
273.111, 273.112, or 273.117 concurrently.
    Subd. 3. Determination of value. Notwithstanding sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11,
the value of any real estate that qualifies under subdivision 2 must, upon timely application by
the owner in the manner provided in subdivision 5, be determined as the value prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue for class 2a tillable property in that county. The house and garage, if any,
and the immediately surrounding one acre of land and a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure, if
any, shall be valued according to their appropriate value. In determining the value for ad valorem
tax purposes, the assessor shall not consider the presence of commercial, industrial, residential,
or seasonal recreational land use influences that may affect the value of real estate defined in
subdivision 1.
    Subd. 4. Separate determination of market value and tax. The assessor shall make a separate
determination of the market value of the real estate based on its highest and best use. The tax based
upon that value and the appropriate local tax rate applicable to the property in the taxing district
shall be recorded on the property assessment records.
    Subd. 5. Application and covenant agreement. (a) Application for deferment of taxes and
assessment under this section shall be filed by May 1 of the year prior to the year in which the
taxes are payable. Any application filed under this subdivision and granted shall continue in effect
for subsequent years until the termination of the covenant agreement under paragraph (b). The
application must be filed with the assessor of the taxing district in which the real property is located
on the form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue. The assessor may require proof by affidavit
or otherwise that the property qualifies under subdivision 2.
456                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [17TH DAY

    (b) The owner of the property must sign a covenant agreement that is filed with the county
assessor and recorded in the county where the property is located. The covenant agreement must
include all of the following:
   (1) legal description of the area to which the covenant applies;
   (2) name and address of the owner;
   (3) a statement that the land described in the covenant must be kept as conservation land, which
meets the requirements of subdivision 2, for the duration of the covenant;
    (4) a statement that the landowner may terminate the covenant agreement by notifying the county
assessor in writing four years in advance of the date of proposed termination, provided that the notice
of intent to terminate may not be given at any time before the land has been subject to the covenant
for a period of four years;
   (5) a statement that the covenant is binding on the owner or the owner's successor or assigns and
runs with the land; and
    (6) a witnessed signature of the owner, agreeing by covenant, to maintain the land as described
in subdivision 2.
    (c) After a covenant under this section has been terminated, the land that had been subject to the
covenant is ineligible for subsequent valuation under this section for a period of three years after
the termination.
    Subd. 6. Additional taxes. Upon termination of a covenant agreement in subdivision 5,
paragraph (b), the land to which the covenant applied shall be subject to additional taxes in the
amount equal to the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision
3 and the amount determined under subdivision 4, provided that the amount determined under
subdivision 4 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the
real property at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under
subdivision 4. The additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the
current year, provided that no interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if timely
paid and that the additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the last three years that the
property has been valued and assessed under this section.
    Subd. 7. Lien. The additional tax imposed by this section shall be a lien upon the property
assessed to the same extent and for the same duration as other taxes imposed on the property in this
state. The tax shall be annually extended by the county auditor and if and when payable shall be
collected and distributed in the manner provided by law for the collection and distribution of other
property taxes.
    Subd. 8. Special local assessments. The payment of special local assessments levied after June
1, 2009, for improvements made to any real property described in subdivision 1 together with the
interest thereon shall, on timely application as provided in subdivision 6, be deferred as long as
the property meets the conditions contained in subdivision 1. If special assessments against the
property have been deferred pursuant to this subdivision, the governmental unit shall file with the
county recorder in the county in which the property is located a certificate containing the legal
description of the affected property and of the amount deferred. When such property no longer
qualifies under subdivision 1, all deferred special assessments plus interest shall be payable in equal
17TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 2009                                          457

installments spread over the time remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued to finance
the improvement for which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred
special assessments plus interest shall be payable within 90 days. The provisions of section 429.061,
subdivision 2, apply to the collection of these installments. Penalty shall not be levied on any such
special assessments if timely paid. This subdivision does not apply to special assessments levied at
any time by a county or district court under chapter 116A or by a watershed district under chapter
103D.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for deferred taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter,
except that for the 2009 assessment year, the application deadline in subdivision 5 is extended to
September 1.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
     (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property m    ­­ay
                                                                                                     ­

   ­­a
     t­­n
       i­ must also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, including but not
limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches, ravines, rock piles, and other
similar land that is impractical for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or
that is unlikely to be able to be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor to receive the reduced class rate and provide the information required by
458                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [17TH DAY

the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate. The commissioner of natural
resources must concur that the land is qualified. The commissioner of natural resources shall
annually provide county assessors verification information on a timely basis.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any

surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (l) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being mined
and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b. It has a class rate of one percent of market value.

in size and the owner of the property must record with the county recorder of the county in which
the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (m) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
