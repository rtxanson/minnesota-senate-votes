    (c) Appropriation bonds may be sold at either public or private sale and may be sold at any price
or percentage of par value. Any bid received at public sale may be rejected.
   (d) Appropriation bonds may bear interest at a fixed or variable rate.
    Subd. 4. Refunding bonds. The commissioner from time to time may issue appropriation bonds
for the purpose of refunding any appropriation bonds then outstanding, including the payment of any
redemption premiums on the bonds, any interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date, and
costs related to the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds. The proceeds of any refunding bonds
may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the purchase or payment at maturity of the
appropriation bonds to be refunded, to the redemption of the outstanding bonds on any redemption
date, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds and may, pending application, be placed in escrow to
be applied to the purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed proceeds, pending
such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized investments under section
11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be applied to the payment of the
bonds to be refunded, interest or premiums on the refunded bonds, or to pay interest on the refunding
bonds. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of such proceeds and any
investment income may be returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the appropriation bonds
proceeds account, for use in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued under the provisions of
this subdivision must be prepared, executed, delivered, and secured by appropriations in the same
manner as the bonds to be refunded.
   Subd. 5. Appropriation bonds as legal investments. Any of the following entities may legally
invest any sinking funds, money, or other funds belonging to them or under their control in any
appropriation bonds issued under this section:
   (1) the state, the investment board, public officers, municipal corporations, political subdivisions,
and public bodies;
   (2) banks and bankers, savings and loan associations, credit unions, trust companies, savings
banks and institutions, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and
other persons carrying on a banking or insurance business; and
   (3) personal representatives, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries.
    Subd. 6. No full faith and credit; state not required to make appropriations. The
appropriation bonds are not public debt of the state, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
the state are not pledged to the payment of the appropriation bonds or to any payment that the state
agrees to make under this section. Appropriation bonds shall not be obligations paid directly, in
whole or in part, from a tax of statewide application on any class of property, income, transaction,
or privilege. Appropriation bonds shall be payable in each fiscal year only from amounts that the
legislature may appropriate for debt service for any fiscal year, provided that nothing in this section
shall be construed to require the state to appropriate funds sufficient to make debt service payments
with respect to the bonds in any fiscal year.
    Subd. 7. Appropriation of proceeds. The proceeds of appropriation bonds and interest credited
to the special appropriation bonds proceeds account are appropriated to the commissioner for
payment of nonoperating, capital expenses as permitted by state and federal law, and nonsalary
expenses incurred in conjunction with the sale of the appropriation bonds.

    Net terminal income from the operation of video lottery terminals authorized under section
349A.071 is exempt from the tax imposed under section 297A.62. The State Lottery must on or
before the 20th day of each month transmit to the commissioner an amount equal to the net terminal
income from the operation of video lottery terminals as defined in section 349A.01, for the previous
month multiplied by 33 percent. The commissioner shall deposit the money transmitted under this
section in the state treasury to be credited as provided in section 297A.94.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 297A.94, is amended to read:

construction and operation of an agricultural resource project; and
    (2) the purchase was made on or after the date on which a conditional commitment was made
for a loan guaranty for the project under section 41A.04, subdivision 3.
The commissioner of finance shall certify to the commissioner the date on which the project received
the conditional commitment. The amount deposited in the loan guaranty account must be reduced
by any refunds and by the costs incurred by the Department of Revenue to administer and enforce
the assessment and collection of the taxes.
    (c) The commissioner shall deposit the revenues, including interest and penalties, derived from
the taxes imposed on sales and purchases included in section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g),
clauses (1) and (4), in the state treasury, and credit them as follows:
  (1) first to the general obligation special tax bond debt service account in each fiscal year the
amount required by section 16A.661, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); and
   (2) after the requirements of clause (1) have been met, the balance to the general fund.
    (d) The commissioner shall deposit the revenues, including interest and penalties, collected
under section 297A.64, subdivision 5, in the state treasury and credit them to the general fund.
By July 15 of each year the commissioner shall transfer to the highway user tax distribution fund
an amount equal to the excess fees collected under section 297A.64, subdivision 5, for the previous
calendar year.
    (e) For fiscal year 2001, 97 percent; for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, 87 percent; and for fiscal
year 2004 and thereafter, 72.43 percent of the revenues, including interest and penalties, transmitted
to the commissioner under section 297A.65, must be deposited by the commissioner in the state
treasury as follows:
    (1) 50 percent of the receipts must be deposited in the heritage enhancement account in the game
and fish fund, and may be spent only on activities that improve, enhance, or protect fish and wildlife
resources, including conservation, restoration, and enhancement of land, water, and other natural

   (2) 22.5 percent of the receipts must be deposited in the natural resources fund, and may be spent

prosecution data, criminal court data, custody and supervision data.
    (b) Classification. Criminal history data maintained by agencies, political subdivisions and
statewide systems are classified as private, pursuant to section 13.02, subdivision 12, except that
data created, collected, or maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that identify an
individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted,
associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement
information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the
offense. If an individual's name or other identifying information is erroneously associated with a
criminal history and a determination is made through a fingerprint verification that the individual is
not the subject of the criminal history, the name or other identifying information must be redacted
from the public criminal history data. The name and other identifying information must be retained
in the criminal history and are classified as private data.
   The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall provide to the public at the central office of the
bureau the ability to inspect in person, at no charge, through a computer monitor the criminal
conviction data classified as public under this subdivision.
    (c) Limitation. Nothing in paragraph (a) or (b) shall limit public access to data made public by
section 13.82.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.871, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 12. Crime alert access request. Data regarding contact information provided by a citizen
requesting a crime alert are classified under section 611A.0393.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 84.027, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Background checks for volunteer instructors. (a) The commissioner may conduct
background checks for volunteer instructor applicants for department safety training and education
programs, including the programs established under sections 84.791 (youth off-highway motorcycle
safety education and training), 84.86 and 84.862 (youth and adult snowmobile safety training),
84.925 (youth all-terrain vehicle safety education and training), 97B.015 (youth firearms safety
training), and 97B.025 (hunter and trapper education and training).
    (b) The commissioner shall perform the background check by retrieving criminal history data as

as defined in section 13.87. A school hiring authority, at its discretion, may decide not to request a
criminal history background check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by
the State Board of Teaching or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an
offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's

in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 152.02, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Schedule V; restrictions on methamphetamine precursor drugs. (a) As used in this
subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given:
    (1) "methamphetamine precursor drug" means any compound, mixture, or preparation intended
for human consumption containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as its sole active ingredient or as
one of its active ingredients; and
    (2) "over-the-counter sale" means a retail sale of a drug or product but does not include the sale
of a drug or product pursuant to the terms of a valid prescription.
      (b) The following items are listed in Schedule V:
   (1) any compound, mixture, or preparation containing any of the following limited quantities
of narcotic drugs, which shall include one or more nonnarcotic active medicinal ingredients in
sufficient proportion to confer upon the compound, mixture or preparation valuable medicinal
qualities other than those possessed by the narcotic drug alone:
      (i) not more than 100 milligrams of dihydrocodeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
      (ii) not more than 100 milligrams of ethylmorphine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
    (iii) not more than 2.5 milligrams of diphenoxylate and not less than 25 micrograms of atropine
sulfate per dosage unit; or
      (iv) not more than 15 milligrams of anhydrous morphine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams;
and
    (2) any compound, mixture, or preparation containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine as its sole
active ingredient or as one of its active ingredients.
   (c) No person may sell in a single over-the-counter sale more than two packages of a
methamphetamine precursor drug or a combination of methamphetamine precursor drugs or any
combination of packages exceeding a total weight of six grams.
      (d) Over-the-counter sales of methamphetamine precursor drugs are limited to:
   (1) packages containing not more than a total of three grams of one or more methamphetamine
precursor drugs, calculated in terms of ephedrine base or pseudoephedrine base; or
   (2) for nonliquid products, sales in blister packs, where each blister contains not more than two
dosage units, or, if the use of blister packs is not technically feasible, sales in unit dose packets or
pouches.
   (e) A business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine precursor drugs in an
over-the-counter sale shall ensure that all packages of the drugs are displayed behind a checkout
counter where the public is not permitted and are offered for sale only by a licensed pharmacist,

a registered pharmacy technician, or a pharmacy clerk. The establishment shall ensure that the
person making the sale requires the buyer:
   (1) to provide photographic identification showing the buyer's date of birth; and
   (2) to sign a written or electronic document detailing the date of the sale, the name of the buyer,
and the amount of the drug sold.
   A document described under clause (2) must be retained by the establishment for at least three
years and must at all reasonable times be open to the inspection of any law enforcement agency.
   Nothing in this paragraph requires the buyer to obtain a prescription for the drug's purchase.
   (f) No person may acquire through over-the-counter sales more than six grams of
methamphetamine precursor drugs within a 30-day period.
    (g) No person may sell in an over-the-counter sale a methamphetamine precursor drug to a
person under the age of 18 years. It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this paragraph if
the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant reasonably and in good
faith relied on proof of age as described in section 340A.503, subdivision 6.
   (h) A person who knowingly violates paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is guilty of a misdemeanor
and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or to payment of a fine of not
more than $1,000, or both.
    (i) An owner, operator, supervisor, or manager of a business establishment that offers for sale
methamphetamine precursor drugs whose employee or agent is convicted of or charged with
violating paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is not subject to the criminal penalties for violating any
of those paragraphs if the person:
    (1) did not have prior knowledge of, participate in, or direct the employee or agent to commit
the violation; and
   (2) documents that an employee training program was in place to provide the employee or
agent with information on the state and federal laws and regulations regarding methamphetamine
precursor drugs.
    (j) Any person employed by a business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine
precursor drugs who sells such a drug to any person in a suspicious transaction shall report the
transaction to the owner, supervisor, or manager of the establishment. The owner, supervisor, or
manager may report the transaction to local law enforcement. A person who reports information
under this subdivision in good faith is immune from civil liability relating to the report.
   (k) Paragraphs (b) to (j) do not apply to:
   (1) pediatric products labeled pursuant to federal regulation primarily intended for
administration to children under 12 years of age according to label instructions;

manufactured in a manner that prevents the drug from being used to manufacture methamphetamine;
   (3) methamphetamine precursor drugs in gel capsule or liquid form; or

    (4) compounds, mixtures, or preparations in powder form where pseudoephedrine constitutes
less than one percent of its total weight and is not its sole active ingredient.
   (l) The Board of Pharmacy, in consultation with the Department of Public Safety, shall certify

determined by a county adult protection or child protection agency to have been responsible for
maltreatment, the court shall be informed of the county, the date of the finding, and the nature of the
maltreatment that was substantiated. The commissioner shall provide the court with information
from the National Criminal Records Repository within three working days of the commissioner's
receipt of the data. When the commissioner finds no criminal history or substantiated maltreatment
on a background study subject, the commissioner shall make these results available to the court
electronically through the secure online background study system.
   (d) Notwithstanding section 626.556, subdivision 10f, or 626.557, subdivision 12b, if the
commissioner or county lead agency has information that a person on whom a background study
was previously done under this section has been determined to be a perpetrator of maltreatment of
a minor or vulnerable adult, the commissioner or the county may provide this information to the
court that requested the background study.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Relief by court. (a) Upon notice and hearing, the court may provide relief as follows:
   (1) restrain the abusing party from committing acts of domestic abuse;
    (2) exclude the abusing party from the dwelling which the parties share or from the residence of
the petitioner;
   (3) exclude the abusing party from a reasonable area surrounding the dwelling or residence,
which area shall be described specifically in the order;
    (4) award temporary custody or establish temporary parenting time with regard to minor children
of the parties on a basis which gives primary consideration to the safety of the victim and the
children. In addition to the primary safety considerations, the court may consider particular best
interest factors that are found to be relevant to the temporary custody and parenting time award.
Findings under section 257.025, 518.17, or 518.175 are not required with respect to the particular
best interest factors not considered by the court. If the court finds that the safety of the victim or the
children will be jeopardized by unsupervised or unrestricted parenting time, the court shall condition
or restrict parenting time as to time, place, duration, or supervision, or deny parenting time entirely,
as needed to guard the safety of the victim and the children. The court's decision on custody and
parenting time shall in no way delay the issuance of an order for protection granting other relief
provided for in this section. The court must not enter a parenting plan under section 518.1705 as
part of an action for an order for protection;
    (5) on the same basis as is provided in chapter 518 or 518A, establish temporary support for
minor children or a spouse, and order the withholding of support from the income of the person
obligated to pay the support according to chapter 518A;
   (6) provide upon request of the petitioner counseling or other social services for the parties, if
married, or if there are minor children;
    (7) order the abusing party to participate in treatment or counseling services, including requiring
the abusing party to successfully complete a domestic abuse counseling program or educational
program under section 518B.02;
   (8) award temporary use and possession of property and restrain one or both parties from

transferring, encumbering, concealing, or disposing of property except in the usual course
of business or for the necessities of life, and to account to the court for all such transfers,
encumbrances, dispositions, and expenditures made after the order is served or communicated to
the party restrained in open court;
   (9) exclude the abusing party from the place of employment of the petitioner, or otherwise limit
access to the petitioner by the abusing party at the petitioner's place of employment;
    (10) order the abusing party to have no contact with the petitioner whether in person, by
telephone, mail, or electronic mail or messaging, through a third party, or by any other means;
   (11) order the abusing party to pay restitution to the petitioner;
   (12) order the continuance of all currently available insurance coverage without change in
coverage or beneficiary designation; ­

    (13) order, in its discretion, other relief as it deems necessary for the protection of a family
or household member, including orders or directives to the sheriff or other law enforcement or
corrections officer as provided by this section; or
    (14) direct the care, possession, or control of a pet or companion animal owned, possessed, or
kept by the petitioner or respondent or a child of the petitioner or respondent, or order the respondent
to have no contact with the pet or companion animal.
   (b) Any relief granted by the order for protection shall be for a period not to exceed two years,
except when the court determines a longer period is appropriate. When a referee presides at the
hearing on the petition, the order granting relief becomes effective upon the referee's signature.
    (c) An order granting the relief authorized in paragraph (a), clause (1), may not be vacated
or modified in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, except that the court
may hear a motion for modification of an order for protection concurrently with a proceeding for
dissolution of marriage upon notice of motion and motion. The notice required by court rule shall
not be waived. If the proceedings are consolidated and the motion to modify is granted, a separate
order for modification of an order for protection shall be issued.
    (d) An order granting the relief authorized in paragraph (a), clause (2) or (3), is not voided by
the admittance of the abusing party into the dwelling from which the abusing party is excluded.
    (e) If a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is pending between the parties,
the court shall provide a copy of the order for protection to the court with jurisdiction over the
dissolution or separation proceeding for inclusion in its file.
   (f) An order for restitution issued under this subdivision is enforceable as civil judgment.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Ex parte order. (a) Where an application under this section alleges an immediate and
present danger of domestic abuse, the court may grant an ex parte order for protection and granting
relief as the court deems proper, including an order:
   (1) restraining the abusing party from committing acts of domestic abuse;
2320                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [36TH DAY

   (2) excluding any party from the dwelling they share or from the residence of the other except
by further order of the court;
   (3) excluding the abusing party from the place of employment of the petitioner or otherwise
limiting access to the petitioner by the abusing party at the petitioner's place of employment;
    (4) ordering the abusing party to have no contact with the petitioner whether in person, by
telephone, mail, e-mail, through electronic devices, or through a third party; ­
                                                                               a­

   (5) continuing all currently available insurance coverage without change in coverage or
beneficiary designation; or
   (6) directing the care, possession, or control of a pet or companion animal owned, possessed, or
kept by a party or a child of a party, or ordering the abusing party to have no contact with the pet or
companion animal.
   (b) A finding by the court that there is a basis for issuing an ex parte order for protection
constitutes a finding that sufficient reasons exist not to require notice under applicable court rules
governing applications for ex parte relief.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (d), an ex parte order for protection shall be effective for a fixed period
set by the court, as provided in subdivision 6, paragraph (b), or until modified or vacated by the
court pursuant to a hearing. When signed by a referee, the ex parte order becomes effective upon
the referee's signature. Upon request, a hearing, as provided by this section, shall be set. Except as
provided in paragraph (d), the respondent shall be personally served forthwith a copy of the ex parte
order along with a copy of the petition and, if requested by the petitioner, notice of the date set for
the hearing. If the petitioner does not request a hearing, an order served on a respondent under this
subdivision must include a notice advising the respondent of the right to request a hearing, must be
accompanied by a form that can be used by the respondent to request a hearing and must include
a conspicuous notice that a hearing will not be held unless requested by the respondent within five
days of service of the order.
    (d) Service of the ex parte order may be made by published notice, as provided under subdivision
5, provided that the petitioner files the affidavit required under that subdivision. If personal service is
not made or the affidavit is not filed within 14 days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
If the petitioner does not request a hearing, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if
known, must be accompanied by the form for requesting a hearing and notice described in paragraph
(c). Unless personal service is completed, if service by published notice is not completed within 28
days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
    (e) If the petitioner seeks relief under subdivision 6 other than the relief described in paragraph
(a), the petitioner must request a hearing to obtain the additional relief.
   (f) Nothing in this subdivision affects the right of a party to seek modification of an order under
subdivision 11.

    Subd. 2. Procedure; criminal history and maltreatment records background check. (a) The

requesting a search of the National Criminal Records Repository, the request must be accompanied

    Subdivision 1. Domestic fatality review teams; purpose. A judicial district may establish a
domestic fatality review team to review domestic violence deaths that have occurred in the district.
The team may review cases in which prosecution has been completed or the prosecutorial authority
has decided not to pursue the case. The purpose of the review team is to assess domestic violence
deaths in order to develop recommendations for policies and protocols for community prevention

this definition; or
   (8) any other circumstances that the domestic fatality review team decides fall within the

relationships.

be designated for a minority representative and one position must rotate in order to include an
advocate from the community in which the fatality under review took place.
   (c) The domestic fatality review team may also invite other relevant persons to serve on an ad
hoc basis and participate as full members of the review team for a particular review. These persons
may include, but are not limited to:
   (1) individuals with particular expertise that would be helpful to the review panel; or
    (2) representatives of organizations or agencies that had contact with or provided services to
the homicide victim, or to the alleged perpetrator, a victim who experienced or was threatened with
domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator, or a family member of one of those individuals.
    Subd. 4. Duties; access to data. (a) The domestic fatality review team shall collect, review, and
analyze death certificates and death data, including investigative reports, medical and counseling
records, victim service records, employment records, child abuse reports, or other information
concerning domestic violence deaths, survivor interviews and surveys, and other information
deemed by the team as necessary and appropriate concerning the causes and manner of domestic
violence deaths.

36TH DAY]                                           MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2009                                                                   2327

   (c) As part of any review, the domestic fatality review team may compel the production of other
records by applying to the district court for a subpoena, which will be effective throughout the state
according to the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    Subd. 5. Confidentiality; data privacy. A person attending a domestic fatality review team
meeting may not disclose what transpired at the meeting, except to carry out the purposes of the
review team or as otherwise provided in this subdivision. The review team may disclose the names of
the victims in the cases it reviewed. The proceedings and records of the review team are confidential
data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 3, or protected nonpublic data as defined in section
13.02, subdivision 13, regardless of their classification in the hands of the person who provided
the data, and are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil or criminal action
against a professional, the state or a county agency, arising out of the matters the team is reviewing.
Information, documents, and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from
discovery or use in a civil or criminal action solely because they were presented during proceedings
of the review team. This section does not limit a person who presented information before the review
team or who is a member of the panel from testifying about matters within the person's knowledge.
However, in a civil or criminal proceeding, a person may not be questioned about the person's good
faith presentation of information to the review team or opinions formed by the person as a result of
the review team meetings.
    Subd. 6. Immunity. Members of the domestic fatality advisory board, members of the domestic
fatality review team, and members of each review panel, as well as their agents or employees, are
immune from claims and are not subject to any suits, liability, damages, or any other recourse, civil
or criminal, arising from any act, proceeding, decision, or determination undertaken or performed or
recommendation made by the domestic fatality review team, provided they acted in good faith and
without malice in carrying out their responsibilities. Good faith is presumed until proven otherwise
and the complainant has the burden of proving malice or a lack of good faith. No organization,
institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports, or records to the domestic
fatality review team as part of an investigation is civilly or criminally liable or subject to any other
recourse for providing the information.
    Subd. 7. Evaluation and report. (a) Each domestic fatality review team shall develop a system
for evaluating the effectiveness of its program and shall focus on identifiable goals and outcomes. An
evaluation must include data components as well as input from individuals involved in the review
process.
    (b) Each fatality review team shall issue an annual report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the senate and house committees with jurisdiction over public safety issues. The report
must consist of the written aggregate recommendations of the domestic fatality review team without
reference to specific cases. The report must be available upon request and distributed to the governor,
attorney general, supreme court, county board, and district court.

    (2) the victim was treated with particular cruelty for which the offender should be held
responsible;

victim was otherwise injured and there is a prior felony conviction for a criminal sexual conduct
offense or an offense in which the victim was otherwise injured;
    (4) the offense was a major economic offense, identified as an illegal act or series of illegal acts
committed by other than physical means and by concealment or guile to obtain money or property,
to avoid payment or loss of money or property, or to obtain business or professional advantage. The

    (i) the offense involved at least three separate transactions in which controlled substances were
sold, transferred, or possessed with intent to do so;
   (ii) the offense involved an attempted or actual sale or transfer of controlled substances in
quantities substantially larger than for personal use;
   (iii) the offense involved the manufacture of controlled substances for use by other parties;

   (9) the offender is a career offender as described in section 609.1095, subdivision 4;
    (10) the offender committed the crime as part of a group of three or more persons who all actively
participated in the crime;
   (11) the offender intentionally selected the victim or the property against which the offense was
committed, in whole or in part, because of the victim's, the property owner's, or another's actual or
perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, or national origin;
   (12) the offender used another's identity without authorization to commit a crime. This
aggravating factor may not be used when the use of another's identity is an element of the offense;
   (13) the offense was committed in the presence of a child; and
   (14) the offense was committed in a location in which the victim had an expectation of privacy.
   (b) Notwithstanding section 609.04 or 609.035, or other law to the contrary, when a court

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 357.021, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Transmittal of fees to commissioner of finance. (a) Every person, including the state
of Minnesota and all bodies politic and corporate, who shall transact any business in the district
court, shall pay to the court administrator of said court the sundry fees prescribed in subdivision
2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or paragraph (d), the court administrator shall
transmit the fees monthly to the commissioner of finance for deposit in the state treasury and credit
to the general fund. $30 of each fee collected in a dissolution action under subdivision 2, clause (1),
must be deposited by the commissioner of finance in the special revenue fund and is appropriated
to the commissioner of employment and economic development for the displaced homemaker
program under section 116L.96. If the Judicial Council authorizes the charges and additional fees,
the per-page charges collected under subdivision 2 and the fee increases described in section 2
must be credited by the commissioner of finance to the court account in the special revenue fund
under section 484.99.
    (b) In a county which has a screener-collector position, fees paid by a county pursuant to this
subdivision shall be transmitted monthly to the county treasurer, who shall apply the fees first to
reimburse the county for the amount of the salary paid for the screener-collector position. The
balance of the fees collected shall then be forwarded to the commissioner of finance for deposit
in the state treasury and credited to the general fund. In a county in a judicial district under section
480.181, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), which has a screener-collector position, the fees paid by a
county shall be transmitted monthly to the commissioner of finance for deposit in the state treasury
and credited to the general fund. A screener-collector position for purposes of this paragraph is an
employee whose function is to increase the collection of fines and to review the incomes of potential
clients of the public defender, in order to verify eligibility for that service.

    (1) credit is granted by a seller or a lender who regularly engages as a seller or lender in credit
transactions of the same kind;
    (2) the buyer is a natural person;
    (3) the claimant is the seller or lender in the transaction; and

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivisions 5 to 10, the territorial
jurisdiction of conciliation court is coextensive with the county in which the court is established.
The summons in a conciliation court action under subdivisions 6 to 10 may be served anywhere
in the state, and the summons in a conciliation court action under subdivision 7, paragraph (b),
may be served outside the state in the manner provided by law. The court administrator shall serve
the summons in a conciliation court action by first class mail, except that if the amount of money
or property that is the subject of the claim exceeds $2,500, the summons must be served by the
plaintiff by certified mail, and service on nonresident defendants must be made in accordance with
applicable law or rule. Subpoenas to secure the attendance of nonparty witnesses and the production
of documents at trial may be served anywhere within the state in the manner provided by law.
   When a court administrator is required to summon the defendant by certified mail under this
paragraph, the summons may be made by personal service in the manner provided in the Rules of
Civil Procedure for personal service of a summons of the district court as an alternative to service
by certified mail.

   (4) agrees to successfully complete a restorative justice program under this section.
    (b) The prosecutor shall refer a child described in paragraph (a) to a restorative justice program
or provider that has been included on the approved provider list described in subdivision 6. The
program or provider shall arrange an appropriate outcome for the matter using restorative justice
concepts. The program or provider shall involve the victim of the offense in the proceedings. If the
victim is unwilling or unable to proceed, or if there is no identifiable victim, the program or provider
shall ensure that someone serves as a proxy for the victim. The program or provider and child, along
with other participants, shall agree in writing to an appropriate sanction for the child. The sanction
may include any of the dispositions authorized in section 260B.235, if appropriate, along with any
other sanctions agreed to.
    Subd. 2. Repeat juvenile petty offenders and nonviolent delinquent offenders; applicability;

   (2) who agrees to successfully complete a restorative justice program under this section.
    (c) The prosecutor shall determine whether a restorative justice outcome under this subdivision
is appropriate for a child described in paragraph (b). If the prosecutor determines it is appropriate,
the child shall be referred to a restorative justice program or provider that has been included on
the approved provider list described in subdivision 6. The program or provider shall arrange an
appropriate outcome for the matter using restorative justice concepts. The program or provider shall
involve the victim of the offense in the proceedings. If the victim is unwilling or unable to proceed,
or if there is no identifiable victim, the program or provider shall ensure that someone serves as a
proxy for the victim. The program or provider and child, along with other participants, shall agree
in writing to an appropriate sanction for the child. The sanction may include any of the dispositions
authorized in section 260B.198, if appropriate, other than an out-of-home placement or transfer of
legal custody of the child, along with any other sanctions agreed to.

shall be referred back to the court for further proceedings.
   Subd. 5. Dismissal of charge. Upon the successful completion by a person of the sanctions
agreed to in the settlement agreement, the program or provider shall notify the court and the court
shall dismiss the charge against the person.
   Subd. 6. Approved list. The prosecutor shall maintain a list of approved restorative justice
programs and providers to which persons may be referred under this section.
   Subd. 7. Preference for culturally specific programs. If a restorative justice program or
provider that is tailored in a more culturally specific manner to the person is on the list of approved
providers under subdivision 6, and the prosecutor is referring the person to a restorative justice
program or provider under this section, the prosecutor shall refer the person to the more appropriate

imposed for the commission of a crime than is authorized by this chapter or other applicable law.
    (b) Except as provided in section 152.18 or 609.375, or upon agreement of the parties, a court
may not refuse to adjudicate the guilt of a defendant who tenders a guilty plea in accordance with
Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 15, or who has been found guilty by a court or jury
following a trial.
   (c) Paragraph (b) does not supersede Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 26.04.
    (d) Except as otherwise specifically provided by state law and notwithstanding any contrary
charter provision or ordinance, no statutory or home rule charter city, county, or town may impose
administrative penalties to enforce a provision of this or any other chapter of state law having a
felony, gross misdemeanor, misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor penalty.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.101, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Controlled substance offenses; minimum fines. (a) Notwithstanding any other law,

36TH DAY]                             MONDAY, APRIL 20, 2009                                             2353

to 152.025 and 152.0262, it must impose a fine of not less than 30 percent of the maximum fine
authorized by law nor more than the maximum fine authorized by law.
    (b) The minimum fine required by this subdivision is in addition to the surcharge or assessment
required by section 357.021, subdivision 6, and is in addition to any sentence of imprisonment or
restitution imposed or ordered by the court.
     (c) The court shall collect the fine mandated by this subdivision and forward 70 percent of
it to a local drug abuse prevention or intervention program existing or being implemented in the
county in which the crime was committed. The court shall forward the remaining 30 percent to the
commissioner of finance to be credited to the general fund. If more than one drug abuse prevention or
intervention program serves the county in which the crime was committed, the court may designate
on a case-by-case basis which program will receive the fine proceeds, giving consideration to the
community in which the crime was committed, the funding needs of the program, the number
of peace officers in each community certified to teach the program, and the number of children
served by the program in each community. If no drug abuse prevention or intervention program
serves communities in that county, the court shall forward 100 percent of the fine proceeds to the
commissioner of finance to be credited to the general fund.
    (d) The minimum fines required by this subdivision shall be collected as are other fines. Fine
proceeds received by a local drug abuse prevention or intervention program must be used to support
that program, and may be used for salaries of program staff or peace officers certified to teach
the program. The ­   d­

     Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 2.724, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Procedure. To promote and secure more efficient administration of justice, the chief
justice of the Supreme Court of the state shall supervise and coordinate the work of the courts of the
state. The Supreme Court may provide by rule that the chief justice not be required to write opinions
as a member of the Supreme Court. Its rules may further provide for it to hear and consider cases in
divisions. It may by rule assign temporarily any retired justice of the Supreme Court or one judge
of the Court of Appeals or district court judge at a time to act as a justice of the Supreme Court
or any number of justices or retired justices of the Supreme Court to act as judges of the Court of
Appeals. Upon the assignment of a Court of Appeals judge or a district court judge to act as a justice
of the Supreme Court, a judge previously acting as a justice may complete unfinished duties of that
position. Any number of justices may disqualify themselves from hearing and considering a case,
in which event the Supreme Court may assign temporarily a retired justice of the Supreme Court,
a Court of Appeals judge, or a district court judge to hear and consider the case in place of each
disqualified justice. A       ­­

order the person to pay the cost of the assessment directly to the entity conducting the assessment or
providing the assessment services in an amount determined by the entity conducting or providing
the service and shall impose a chemical dependency assessment charge of ­      $1
                                                                                ­2­­

waive the $25 assessment charged, but may not waive the cost for the assessment as to be paid
directly to the entity conducting the assessment or providing assessment services. A person shall
pay an additional surcharge of $5 if the person is convicted of a violation of section 169A.20 (driving
while impaired) within five years of a prior impaired driving conviction or a prior conviction for
an offense arising out of an arrest for a violation of section 169A.20 or Minnesota Statutes 1998,
section 169.121 (driver under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) or 169.129 (aggravated
DWI-related violations; penalty). This section applies when the sentence is executed, stayed, or
suspended. The court may not waive payment or authorize payment of the assessment charge and
surcharge in installments unless it makes written findings on the record that the convicted person is
indigent or that the assessment charge and surcharge would create undue hardship for the convicted
person or that person's immediate family.
    (b) The chemical dependency assessment charge and surcharge required under this section are
in addition to the surcharge required by section 357.021, subdivision 6 (surcharges on criminal and
traffic offenders).

a sufficient quantity of alcohol after the time of the violation and before the administration of the
evidentiary test to cause the defendant's alcohol concentration to exceed the level specified in the
applicable clause. Evidence that the defendant consumed alcohol after the time of the violation may
not be admitted in defense to any alleged violation of section 169A.20, unless notice is given to the
prosecution prior to the omnibus or pretrial hearing in the matter.

is convicted of more than one offense in a case, the surcharge shall be imposed only once in that
case. In the Second Judicial District, the court shall impose, and the court administrator shall
collect, an additional $1 surcharge on every person convicted of any felony, gross misdemeanor,
misdemeanor, or petty misdemeanor offense, including a violation of a law or ordinance relating to
vehicle parking, if the Ramsey County Board of Commissioners authorizes the $1 surcharge. The
surcharge shall be imposed whether or not the person is sentenced to imprisonment or the sentence
is stayed. The surcharge shall not be imposed when a person is convicted of a petty misdemeanor
for which no fine is imposed.
   (b) If the court fails to impose a surcharge as required by this subdivision, the court administrator
shall show the imposition of the surcharge, collect the surcharge, and correct the record.
    (c) The court may not waive payment of the surcharge required under this subdivision. Upon
a showing of indigency or undue hardship upon the convicted person or the convicted person's
immediate family, the sentencing court may authorize payment of the surcharge in installments.
   (d) The court administrator or other entity collecting a surcharge shall forward it to the
commissioner of finance.
    (e) If the convicted person is sentenced to imprisonment and has not paid the surcharge before
the term of imprisonment begins, the chief executive officer of the correctional facility in which the
convicted person is incarcerated shall collect the surcharge from any earnings the inmate accrues
from work performed in the facility or while on conditional release. The chief executive officer shall

    Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 480.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
2364                                                        JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                        [36TH DAY

    Subd. 10c. Uniform collections policies and procedures for courts. (a) Notwithstanding
chapter 16D, the state court administrator under the direction of the Judicial Council may
promulgate uniform collections policies and procedures for the courts and may contract with credit
bureaus, public and private collection agencies, the Department of Revenue, and other public or
private entities providing collection services as necessary for the collection of court debts. The
court collection process and procedures are not subject to section 16A.1285 or chapter 16D.
    (b) Court debt means an amount owed to the state directly or through the judicial branch on
account of a fee, duty, rent, service, overpayment, fine, assessment, surcharge, court cost, penalty,
restitution, damages, interest, bail bond, forfeiture, reimbursement, liability owed, an assignment
to the judicial branch, recovery of costs incurred by the judicial branch, or any other source of
indebtedness to the judicial branch as well as amounts owed to other public or private entities for
which the judicial branch acts in providing collection services, or any other amount owed to the
judicial branch.
    (c) The courts must pay for the collection services of public or private collection entities as well
as the cost of one or more court employees to provide collection interface services between the
Department of Revenue, the courts, and one or more collection entities from the money collected.
The portion of the money collected which must be paid to the collection entity as collection fees
and costs and the portion of the money collected which must be paid to the courts or Department of
Revenue for collection services are appropriated from the fund to which the collected money is due.
    (d) As determined by the state court administrator, collection costs shall be added to the debts
referred to a public or private collection entity for collection.
   Collection costs shall include the fees of the collection entity, and may include, if separately
provided, skip tracing fees, credit bureau reporting charges, fees assessed by any public entity for
obtaining information necessary for debt collection, or other collection-related costs. Collection
costs shall also include the costs of one or more court employees employed by the state court
administrator to provide a collection interface between the collection entity, the Department of
Revenue, and the courts.
    If the collection entity collects an amount less than the total due, the payment is applied
proportionally to collection costs and the underlying debt. Collection costs in excess of collection
agency fees and court employee collection interface costs must be deposited in the general fund
as nondedicated receipts.

     Sec. 33. [609.104] FINE AND SURCHARGE COLLECTION.
    Subdivision 1. Failure to pay restitution or fine. (a) Any portion of a fine, surcharge, court
cost, restitution, or fee that the defendant fails to pay by the due date may be referred for collection
under section 480.15, subdivision 10c. If the defendant has agreed to a payment plan but fails to
pay an installment when due, the entire amount remaining becomes due and payable and may be
referred for collection under section 480.15, subdivision 10c.
    (b) The defendant may contest the referral for collection based on inability to pay by requesting
a hearing no later than the due date. The defendant shall be notified in writing at sentencing that
under section 480.15, subdivision 10c, the court may refer the case for collection for nonpayment,
and collection costs may be added to the amount due. The defendant shall also be notified in writing
of the right to contest a referral for collection. The state court administrator shall develop the notice
language.
    Subd. 2. Fine and surcharge collection. (a) A defendant's obligation to pay court-ordered fines,
surcharges, court costs, restitution, and fees shall survive after the due date for a period set by the
Judicial Council.
    (b) Any change in the collection period established by the Judicial Council shall be effective on
court-ordered fines, surcharges, court costs, restitution, and fees imposed on or after the effective
date of this section.
   (c) The period relating to a defendant's obligation to pay restitution under paragraph (a) does not
limit the victim's right to collect restitution through other means such as a civil judgment.
    (d) Nothing in this subdivision extends the period of a defendant's stay of sentence imposition
or execution.
     Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.125, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Sentences available. (a) Upon conviction of a misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor the court, if sentence is imposed, may, to the extent authorized by law, sentence the
defendant:
     (1) to imprisonment for a definite term; or
   (2) to payment of a fine,

   (5) to payment of a local correctional fee as authorized under section 609.102 in addition to any
other sentence imposed by the court; or
   (6) to perform work service in a restorative justice program in addition to any other sentence
imposed by the court.
    (b) If the court imposes a fine or orders restitution under paragraph (a), payment is due on the
date imposed unless the court otherwise establishes a due date or a payment plan.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.131, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Use of conviction for enhancement. Notwithstanding any other law, a conviction for
a violation that was originally charged as a misdemeanor and was treated as a petty misdemeanor
under subdivision 1 or the Rules of Criminal Procedure, or was treated as a petty misdemeanor
by inclusion on the uniform fine schedule, may not be used as the basis for charging a subsequent
violation as a gross misdemeanor rather than a misdemeanor.
   Sec. 36. [609.1315] UNIFORM FINE SCHEDULE.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment and effective date. The Judicial Council shall establish a uniform
fine schedule in consultation with affected state and local agencies. The uniform fine schedule may
include petty misdemeanor and misdemeanor offenses, but shall not include targeted misdemeanors
as defined in section 299C.10. The uniform fine schedule shall set a fine that may be paid for each
offense in lieu of a court appearance. The uniform fine schedule shall be submitted to the chairs and
ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees having jurisdiction
over criminal justice policy and funding by January 15 of each year and shall become effective on
July 1 of that year unless the legislature, by law, provides otherwise.
    Subd. 2. Effect on misdemeanor offenses. Any misdemeanors included on the uniform fine
schedule shall be treated as petty misdemeanors unless on the third or subsequent offense, the charge
is brought by formal complaint or, for offenses described in chapter 169, the violation was committed
in a manner or under circumstances so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property.
Nothing in this section limits the operation of section 169.89, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 3. Notice. A defendant must be advised in writing that payment of the fine for an offense
on the uniform fine schedule constitutes a plea of guilty, waiver of the right to trial, and waiver of
the right to counsel.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.135, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Terms and conditions. (a) Except when a sentence of life imprisonment is
required by law, or when a mandatory minimum sentence is required by section 609.11, any court
may stay imposition or execution of sentence and:
   (1) may order intermediate sanctions without placing the defendant on probation; or
    (2) may place the defendant on probation with or without supervision and on the terms the court
prescribes, including intermediate sanctions when practicable. The court may order the supervision
to be under the probation officer of the court, or, if there is none and the conviction is for a felony
or gross misdemeanor, by the commissioner of corrections, or in any case by some other suitable

and consenting person. Unless the court directs otherwise, state parole and probation agents and
probation officers may impose community work service or probation violation sanctions, consistent
with section 243.05, subdivision 1; sections 244.196 to 244.199; or 401.02, subdivision 5.
   No intermediate sanction may be ordered performed at a location that fails to observe applicable
requirements or standards of chapter 181A or 182, or any rule promulgated under them.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, subdivision 6, and section 609.14, the term "intermediate
sanctions" includes but is not limited to incarceration in a local jail or workhouse, home detention,
electronic monitoring, intensive probation, sentencing to service, reporting to a day reporting
center, chemical dependency or mental health treatment or counseling, restitution, fines, day-fines,
community work service, work service in a restorative justice program, work in lieu of or to work
off fines and, with the victim's consent, work in lieu of or to work off restitution.
    (c) A court may not stay the revocation of the driver's license of a person convicted of violating
the provisions of section 169A.20.
    (d) If the court orders a fine, day-fine, or restitution as an intermediate sanction, payment is due
on the date imposed unless the court otherwise establishes a due date or a payment plan.

the payment schedule or structure established by the court or the probation officer, the prosecutor
or the defendant's probation officer may, on the prosecutor's or the officer's own motion or at the
request of the victim, ask the court to hold a hearing to determine whether or not the conditions
of probation should be changed or probation should be revoked. The defendant's probation officer
shall ask for the hearing if the restitution ­

the term of probation expires. The court shall schedule and hold this hearing and take appropriate
action, including action under subdivision 2, paragraph (g), before the defendant's term of probation
expires.
   Nothing in this subdivision limits the court's ability to refer the case to collections under section
609.104 when a defendant fails to pay court-ordered restitution.
    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.135, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Stay of sentence maximum periods. (a) If the conviction is for a felony other than
section 609.21, subdivision 1a, paragraph (b) or (c), the stay shall be for not more than four years or
the maximum period for which the sentence of imprisonment might have been imposed, whichever
is longer.
    (b) If the conviction is for a gross misdemeanor violation of section 169A.20 or 609.21,
subdivision 1a, paragraph (d), or for a felony described in section 609.21, subdivision 1a, paragraph
(b) or (c), the stay shall be for not more than six years. The court shall provide for unsupervised
probation for the last year of the stay unless the court finds that the defendant needs supervised
probation for all or part of the last year.
    (c) If the conviction is for a gross misdemeanor not specified in paragraph (b), the stay shall be
for not more than two years.

    (d) If the conviction is for any misdemeanor under section 169A.20; 609.746, subdivision 1;
609.79; or 617.23; or for a misdemeanor under section 609.2242 or 609.224, subdivision 1, in which
the victim of the crime was a family or household member as defined in section 518B.01, the stay
shall be for not more than two years. The court shall provide for unsupervised probation for the
second year of the stay unless the court finds that the defendant needs supervised probation for all
or part of the second year.
   (e) If the conviction is for a misdemeanor not specified in paragraph (d), the stay shall be for not
more than one year.
   (f) The defendant shall be discharged six months after the term of the stay expires, unless the stay
has been revoked or extended under paragraph (g), or the defendant has already been discharged.
    (g) Notwithstanding the maximum periods specified for stays of sentences under paragraphs (a)
to (f), a court may extend a defendant's term of probation for up to one year if it finds, at a hearing
conducted under subdivision 1a, that:

powers and examination procedures. With the exception of industrial loan and thrift companies
which do not have deposit liabilities and licensed regulated lenders, it shall be the principal
purpose of these examinations to inspect and verify the assets and liabilities of each and so far
investigate the character and value of the assets of each institution as to determine with reasonable
certainty that the values are correctly carried on its books. Assets and liabilities shall be verified in
accordance with methods of procedure which the commissioner may determine to be adequate to
carry out the intentions of this section. It shall be the further purpose of these examinations to assess
the adequacy of capital protection and the capacity of the institution to meet usual and reasonably
anticipated deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments without resorting to excessive
borrowing or sale of assets at a significant loss, and to investigate each institution's compliance
with applicable laws and rules. Based on the examination findings, the commissioner shall make
a determination as to whether the institution is being operated in a safe and sound manner. None
of the above provisions limits the commissioner in making additional examinations as deemed
necessary or advisable. The commissioner shall investigate the methods of operation and conduct

of these institutions and their systems of accounting, to ascertain whether these methods and
systems are in accordance with law and sound banking principles. The commissioner may make
requirements as to records as deemed necessary to facilitate the carrying out of the commissioner's
duties and to properly protect the public interest. The commissioner may examine, or cause to be
examined by these examiners, on oath, any officer, director, trustee, owner, agent, clerk, customer,
or depositor of any financial institution touching the affairs and business thereof, and may issue, or
cause to be issued by the examiners, subpoenas, and administer, or cause to be administered by
the examiners, oaths. In case of any refusal to obey any subpoena issued under the commissioner's
direction, the refusal may at once be reported to the district court of the district in which the bank
or other financial institution is located, and this court shall enforce obedience to these subpoenas
in the manner provided by law for enforcing obedience to subpoenas of the court. In all matters
relating to official duties, the commissioner of commerce has the power possessed by courts of law
to issue subpoenas and cause them to be served and enforced, and all officers, directors, trustees,
and employees of state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings associations, and other
financial institutions within the state, and all persons having dealings with or knowledge of the
affairs or methods of these institutions, shall afford reasonable facilities for these examinations,
make returns and reports to the commissioner of commerce as the commissioner may require;
attend and answer, under oath, the commissioner's lawful inquiries; produce and exhibit any books,
accounts, documents, and property as the commissioner may desire to inspect, and in all things aid
the commissioner in the performance of duties.

performance of duties, the commissioner finds it necessary to make a special investigation of any
financial institution under the commissioner's supervision, and other than a complete examination,
the commissioner shall make a charge therefor to include only the necessary costs thereof. Such a
fee shall be payable to the commissioner on the commissioner's making a request for payment.
