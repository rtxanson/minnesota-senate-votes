     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 58.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Residential mortgage originators. (a) An applicant for a residential mortgage
originator license must file with the department a surety bond in the amount of $100,000, issued
by an insurance company authorized to do so in this state. The bond must cover all mortgage loan
originators who are employees or independent agents of the applicant. The bond must be available
for the recovery of expenses, fines, and fees levied by the commissioner under this chapter and for
losses incurred by borrowers as a result of a licensee's noncompliance with the requirements of
this chapter, sections 325D.43 to 325D.48, and 325F.67 to 325F.69, or breach of contract relating
to activities regulated by this chapter.
   (b) The bond must be submitted with the originator's license application and evidence of
continued coverage must be submitted with each renewal. Any change in the bond must be
submitted for approval by the commissioner, within ten days of its execution. The bond or a
substitute bond shall remain in effect during all periods of licensing.
     (c) Upon filing of the mortgage call report as required by section 58A.17, a licensee shall
maintain or increase its surety bond to reflect the total dollar amount of the closed residential
mortgage loans originated in this state in the preceding year in accordance with the table in this
paragraph. A licensee may decrease its surety bond in accordance with the table in this paragraph
if the surety bond required is less than the amount of the surety bond on file with the department.

    Subd. 4. Cancellation. A licensee ceasing an activity or activities regulated by this chapter and
desiring to no longer be licensed shall so inform the commissioner in writing and, at the same time,
surrender the license and all other symbols or indicia of licensure. The licensee shall include a plan
for the withdrawal from regulated business, including a timetable for the disposition of the business.
   Sec. 7. ASSESSMENT.
    The commissioner may levy a pro rata assessment on institutions licensed under Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 58, to recover the costs to the Department of Commerce for administering the
licensing and registration requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 58A.10. The assessment
amount must be determined by dividing those costs by the number of licensees.
    The commissioner shall levy the assessments and notify each institution of the amount of the
assessment being levied by September 30, 2010. The institution shall pay the assessment to the
department no later than November 30, 2010. If an institution fails to pay its assessment by this
date, its license may be suspended by the commissioner until it is paid in full.

into, renewed, or amended on or after that date.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62Q.735, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 6. Reimbursement tiering methodologies. Where health plan company reimbursement
is related to tiering of providers, the health plan company shall provide to any tiered providers upon
request an explanation of the methodology used to calculate tier ranking, including information on
cost and quality. This explanation does not allow any provider access to proprietary or trade secret
information. When a tiered product is used by a health plan, the health plan company shall provide
notification to the provider of the tier in which the provider is included prior to the effective date of
the tiered product.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011, and applies to contracts entered
into, renewed, or amended on or after that date.

4a, or by federal law, the health care providers and facilities specified in subdivision 2 must submit
their charges to a health plan company or third-party administrator within six months from the date
of service or the date the health care provider knew or was informed of the correct name and address
of the responsible health plan company or third-party administrator, whichever is later. A health care
provider or facility that does not make an initial submission of charges within the six-month period
shall not be reimbursed for the charge and may not collect the charge from the recipient of the service
or any other payer. The six-month submission requirement may be extended to 12 months in cases
where a health care provider or facility specified in subdivision 2 has determined and can substantiate
that it has experienced a significant disruption to normal operations that materially affects the ability
to conduct business in a normal manner and to submit claims on a timely basis. Any request by a
health care provider or facility specified in subdivision 2 for an exception to a contractually defined
claims submission timeline must be reviewed and acted upon by the health plan company within
the same time frame as the contractually agreed upon claims filing timeline. This subdivision also
applies to all health care providers and facilities that submit charges to workers' compensation payers
for treatment of a workers' compensation injury compensable under chapter 176, or to reparation
obligors for treatment of an injury compensable under chapter 65B.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011, and applies to contracts entered

and recoupments of the payment with the exception of payments related to coordination of benefits,
subrogation, duplicate claims, retroactive terminations, and cases of fraud and abuse.
   (b) Paragraph (a) shall not apply to pharmacy contracts entered into between or on behalf of
health plan companies.

into, renewed, or amended on or after that date.

extended jurisdiction juvenile has violated the conditions of the stayed sentence, or is alleged to
have committed a new offense, the court may, without notice, revoke the stay and probation and
direct that the offender be taken into immediate custody. The court shall notify the offender in
writing of the reasons alleged to exist for revocation of the stay of execution of the adult sentence.
If the offender challenges the reasons, the court shall hold a summary hearing on the issue at which
the offender is entitled to be heard and represented by counsel.

    (c) After the hearing, if the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay of execution of
sentence, the court shall treat the offender as an adult and order any of the adult sanctions authorized
by section 609.14, subdivision 3, except that no credit shall be given for time served in juvenile
facility custody prior to a summary hearing. If the offender was convicted of an offense described in

execution of the previously imposed sentence unless the court makes written findings regarding the
mitigating factors that justify continuing the stay.

   (2) the fact finder determines that the offender is a danger to public safety; and

the risk of reoffending is great without intensive psychotherapeutic intervention or other long-term
treatment or supervision extending beyond the presumptive term of imprisonment and supervised
release.
   (b) The fact finder shall base its determination that the offender is a danger to public safety on
any of the following factors:

aggravating factor applicable to repeat criminal sexual conduct convictions;
   (ii) the person received an upward durational departure from the sentencing guidelines for the
previous sex offense conviction; or
    (iii) the person was sentenced under this section or Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 609.108,

of the prior sex offense convictions; or
    (iii) the person was sentenced under this section or Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 609.108,

are being used as the basis for the sentence are for violations of section 609.342, 609.343, 609.344,
or 609.3453, or any similar statute of the United States, this state, or any other state.

States, this state, or any other state.

supervision until the offender's conditional release term expires.
    (b) The conditions of release may include successful completion of treatment and aftercare
in a program approved by the commissioner, satisfaction of the release conditions specified in

The commissioner shall develop a plan to pay the cost of treatment of a person released under
this subdivision. The plan may include co-payments from offenders, third-party payers, local
agencies, or other funding sources as they are identified. This section does not require the
commissioner to accept or retain an offender in a treatment program. Before the offender is placed
on conditional release, the commissioner shall notify the sentencing court and the prosecutor in the
jurisdiction where the offender was sentenced of the terms of the offender's conditional release.
The commissioner also shall make reasonable efforts to notify the victim of the offender's crime of
the terms of the offender's conditional release. If the offender fails to meet any condition of release,
the commissioner may revoke the offender's conditional release and order that the offender serve
all or a part of the remaining portion of the conditional release term in prison.
    Subd. 9. Applicability. The provisions of this section do not affect the applicability of
Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 609.108, to crimes committed before August 1, 2005, or the
validity of sentences imposed under Minnesota Statutes 2004, section 609.108.
    Subd. 10. Special review panel. A special review panel is established and is governed by section
15.0575, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. The panel consists of the commissioner
of corrections or a designee and two members of the public. The term of the public members is four
years. The governor shall appoint the public members with the advice and consent of the senate.
Public members must be knowledgable of and have a demonstrated interest in criminal justice but
need not be employed in the criminal justice field. The commissioner shall convene the panel's first
meeting. The panel shall elect a chair from among its members. The panel shall meet at the call of the
chair. The panel shall hear and consider all petitions for supervised release from imprisonment under
subdivision 11 and determine whether to direct the commissioner of corrections to give supervised

a hearing on each petition for release before making any determination. Within 45 days of the
filing of the petition, the panel shall give written notice of the time and place of the hearing before
the panel to all interested parties, including the petitioner, the petitioner's attorney if applicable,
law enforcement and correctional personnel involved in the case, the sentencing court, the county
attorney's office that prosecuted the case, and any victims of the crime who have indicated a desire
to be notified. The hearing must be recorded and held on the record. The petitioner may present
witnesses on the petitioner's behalf. The county attorney who prosecuted the case, the sentencing
judge, law enforcement and correctional personnel involved in the case, the victim and the victim's
family members, and any other interested party may submit a written or oral statement at the hearing
addressing the appropriateness of the inmate's release.
   (b) If the panel votes to direct the commissioner to give supervised release to the petitioner, the
commissioner shall do so no later than 14 days after the panel's determination.
    (c) If the panel rejects the inmate's petition for supervised release, it shall specify in writing the
reasons for the rejection. The inmate may not petition for supervised release again until 36 months
have elapsed since the rejection, unless the panel specifies a shorter time period.
    Subd. 12. Criteria for release. (a) When considering whether to order the commissioner of
corrections to give supervised release to an inmate serving a sentence under subdivision 3, paragraph
(c); 3b; or 4, paragraph (b), the panel shall consider, at a minimum, the following: the risk the
inmate poses to the community if released, the inmate's progress in treatment, the inmate's behavior
while incarcerated, psychological or other diagnostic evaluations of the inmate, the inmate's criminal
history, the ability of the inmate to readjust to open society, the testimony or statements of individuals
with an interest in the case made at the hearing, and any other relevant conduct of the inmate while

   (a) Mental health urgent care includes:
74TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010                                        7753

individuals in obtaining health care coverage.
   (b) Psychiatric consultation services includes psychiatric consultation to primary care
practitioners.
   Subd. 3. Rapid access to psychiatry. The commissioner shall develop rapid access to
psychiatric services based on the following criteria:
   (1) the individuals who receive the psychiatric services must be at risk of hospitalization and
otherwise unable to receive timely services;
    (2) where clinically appropriate, the service may be provided via interactive video where the
service is provided in conjunction with an emergency room, a local crisis service, or a primary care
or behavioral care practitioner; and
    (3) the commissioner may integrate rapid access to psychiatry with the psychiatric consultation
services in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 4. Collaborative psychiatric consultation. (a) The commissioner shall establish a
collaborative psychiatric consultation service based on the following criteria:
    (1) the service may be available via telephone, interactive video, e-mail, or other means of
communication to emergency rooms, local crisis services, mental health professionals, and primary
care practitioners, including pediatricians;
   (2) the service shall be provided by a multidisciplinary team including, at a minimum, a child
and adolescent psychiatrist, an adult psychiatrist, and a licensed clinical social worker;
    (3) the service shall include a triage-level assessment to determine the most appropriate
response to each request, including appropriate referrals to other mental health professionals, as
well as provision of rapid psychiatric access when other appropriate services are not available;
   (4) the first priority for this service is to provide the consultations required under section
256B.0625, subdivision 13j; and
   (5) the service must encourage use of cognitive and behavioral therapies and other
evidence-based treatments in addition to or in place of medication, where appropriate.
   (b) The commissioner shall appoint an interdisciplinary work group to establish appropriate
medication and psychotherapy protocols to guide the consultative process, including consultation
with the Drug Utilization Review Board, as provided in section 256B.0625, subdivision 13j.

mental health urgent care services based on the limits of appropriations and the commissioner's
determination of level of need and cost-effectiveness.
    (b) For subdivisions 3 and 4, the first phase must focus on adults in Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties and children statewide who are affected by section 256B.0625, subdivision 13j, and must
include tracking of costs for the services provided and associated impacts on utilization of inpatient,
emergency room, and other services.
    Subd. 6. Limited appropriations. The commissioner shall maximize use of available health care
coverage for the services provided under this section. The commissioner's responsibility to provide
these services for individuals without health care coverage must not exceed the appropriations for
this section.
    Subd. 7. Flexible implementation. To implement this section, the commissioner shall select the
structure and funding method that is the most cost-effective for each county or group of counties.
This may include grants, contracts, direct provision by state-operated services, and public-private
partnerships. Where feasible, the commissioner shall make any grants under this section a part of
the integrated adult mental health initiative grants under section 245.4661.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
74TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010                                          7755

preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.

health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision 16
are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for purposes
of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2006, to
reflect this reduction.
    (e) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the total payment for
fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 3.46 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective April 1, 2010.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 27, is amended to read:
    Subd. 27. Quarterly payment adjustment. (a) In addition to any other payment under this
section, the commissioner shall make the following payments effective July 1, 2007:
   (1) for a hospital located in Minnesota and not eligible for payments under subdivision 20, with
a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate greater than 17.8 percent of total patient days as of the
base year in effect on July 1, 2005, a payment equal to 13 percent of the total of the operating and
property payment rates;
    (2) for a hospital located in Minnesota in a specified urban area outside of the seven-county

inpatient utilization rate less than or equal to 17.8 percent of total patient days as of the base year
in effect on July 1, 2005, a payment equal to ten percent of the total of the operating and property
payment rates. For purposes of this clause, the following cities are specified urban areas: Detroit
Lakes, Rochester, Willmar, Alexandria, Austin, Cambridge, Brainerd, Hibbing, Mankato, Duluth,
St. Cloud, Grand Rapids, Wyoming, Fergus Falls, Albert Lea, Winona, Virginia, Thief River Falls,
and Wadena;
    (3) for a hospital located in Minnesota but not located in a specified urban area under clause (2),
with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate less than or equal to 17.8 percent of total patient
days as of the base year in effect on July 1, 2005, a payment equal to four percent of the total of the
operating and property payment rates. A hospital located in Woodbury and not in existence during
the base year shall be reimbursed under this clause; and
    (4) in addition to any payments under clauses (1) to (3), for a hospital located in Minnesota and
not eligible for payments under subdivision 20 with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate
of 17.9 percent of total patient days as of the base year in effect on July 1, 2005, a payment equal to
eight percent of the total of the operating and property payment rates, and for a hospital located in
Minnesota and not eligible for payments under subdivision 20 with a medical assistance inpatient
utilization rate of 59.6 percent of total patient days as of the base year in effect on July 1, 2005, a
payment equal to nine percent of the total of the operating and property payment rates. After making
any ratable adjustments required under paragraph (b), the commissioner shall proportionately reduce
payments under clauses (2) and (3) by an amount needed to make payments under this clause.
    (b) The state share of payments under paragraph (a) shall be equal to federal reimbursements
to the commissioner to reimburse expenditures reported under section 256B.199, paragraphs (a) to
(d). The commissioner shall ratably reduce or increase payments under this subdivision in order
to ensure that these payments equal the amount of reimbursement received by the commissioner
under section 256B.199, paragraphs (a) to (d), except that payments shall be ratably reduced by
an amount equivalent to the state share of a four percent reduction in MinnesotaCare and medical
assistance payments for inpatient hospital services. Effective July 1, 2009, the ratable reduction
shall be equivalent to the state share of a three percent reduction in these payments. Effective for

later.
   (d) The commissioner shall not adjust rates paid to a prepaid health plan under contract with the
commissioner to reflect payments provided in paragraph (a).
    (e) The commissioner shall maximize the use of available federal money for disproportionate
share hospital payments and shall maximize payments to qualifying hospitals. In order to accomplish
these purposes, the commissioner may, in consultation with the nonstate entities identified in section
256B.199, paragraphs (a) to (d), adjust, on a pro rata basis if feasible, the amounts reported by
nonstate entities under section 256B.199, paragraphs (a) to (d), when application for reimbursement
is made to the federal government, and otherwise adjust the provisions of this subdivision. The
commissioner shall utilize a settlement process based on finalized data to maximize revenue under
section 256B.199, paragraphs (a) to (d), and payments under this section.

to be used for the prior authorization of brand-name drugs for which generically equivalent drugs are
available, but the committee is not required to review each brand-name drug for which a generically
equivalent drug is available.
    (b) Prior authorization may be required by the commissioner before certain formulary drugs
are eligible for payment. The Formulary Committee may recommend drugs for prior authorization
directly to the commissioner. The commissioner may also request that the Formulary Committee
review a drug for prior authorization. Before the commissioner may require prior authorization for
a drug:
    (1) the commissioner must provide information to the Formulary Committee on the impact that
placing the drug on prior authorization may have on the quality of patient care and on program costs,
information regarding whether the drug is subject to clinical abuse or misuse, and relevant data from
the state Medicaid program if such data is available;
    (2) the Formulary Committee must review the drug, taking into account medical and clinical
data and the information provided by the commissioner; and
   (3) the Formulary Committee must hold a public forum and receive public comment for an
additional 15 days.
The commissioner must provide a 15-day notice period before implementing the prior authorization.
   (c) Except as provided in subdivision 13j, prior authorization shall not be required or utilized
7758                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [74TH DAY

for any atypical antipsychotic drug prescribed for the treatment of mental illness if:
   (1) there is no generically equivalent drug available; and
   (2) the drug was initially prescribed for the recipient prior to July 1, 2003; or
   (3) the drug is part of the recipient's current course of treatment.
This paragraph applies to any multistate preferred drug list or supplemental drug rebate program
established or administered by the commissioner. Prior authorization shall automatically be granted
for 60 days for brand name drugs prescribed for treatment of mental illness within 60 days of when
a generically equivalent drug becomes available, provided that the brand name drug was part of the
recipient's course of treatment at the time the generically equivalent drug became available.
   (d) Prior authorization shall not be required or utilized for any antihemophilic factor drug
prescribed for the treatment of hemophilia and blood disorders where there is no generically
equivalent drug available if the prior authorization is used in conjunction with any supplemental
drug rebate program or multistate preferred drug list established or administered by the
commissioner.
    (e) The commissioner may require prior authorization for brand name drugs whenever a
generically equivalent product is available, even if the prescriber specifically indicates "dispense
as written-brand necessary" on the prescription as required by section 151.21, subdivision 2.
    (f) Notwithstanding this subdivision, the commissioner may automatically require prior
authorization, for a period not to exceed 180 days, for any drug that is approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration on or after July 1, 2005. The 180-day period begins no
later than the first day that a drug is available for shipment to pharmacies within the state. The
Formulary Committee shall recommend to the commissioner general criteria to be used for the
prior authorization of the drugs, but the committee is not required to review each individual drug.
In order to continue prior authorizations for a drug after the 180-day period has expired, the
commissioner must follow the provisions of this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective April 1, 2010.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

disorder medications. (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the Drug Utilization Review
Board established in subdivision 13i and actively practicing pediatric mental health professionals,
must:
    (1) identify recommended pediatric dose ranges for atypical antipsychotic drugs and drugs
used for attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on available
medical, clinical, and safety data and research. The commissioner shall periodically review the list
of medications and pediatric dose ranges and update the medications and doses listed as needed
after consultation with the Drug Utilization Review Board;
    (2) identify situations where a collaborative psychiatric consultation and prior authorization
should be required before the initiation or continuation of drug therapy in pediatric patients
including, but not limited to, high-dose regimens, off-label use of prescription medication, a

    (3) track prescriptive practices and the use of psychotropic medications in children with the goal
of reducing the use of medication, where appropriate.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2011, the commissioner shall require prior authorization and a collaborative
psychiatric consultation before an atypical antipsychotic and attention deficit disorder and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder medication meeting the criteria identified in paragraph (a), clause
(2), is eligible for payment. A collaborative psychiatric consultation must be completed before the
identified medications are eligible for payment unless:
   (1) the patient has already been stabilized on the medication regimen; or
   (2) the prescriber indicates that the child is in crisis.
If clause (1) or (2) applies, the collaborative psychiatric consultation must be completed within 90
days for payment to continue.

The commissioner shall establish participation requirements for health maintenance organizations.
The commissioner shall provide lists of participating medical assistance providers on a quarterly
basis to the commissioner of management and budget, the commissioner of labor and industry,
and the commissioner of commerce. Each of the commissioners shall develop and implement

a supplemental payment to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital for these
services that would increase medical assistance spending in this category to the aggregate upper
payment limit for all nonstate government hospitals in Minnesota. In making this determination,
the commissioner shall allot the available increases between Hennepin County Medical Center
and Regions Hospital based on the ratio of medical assistance fee-for-service outpatient hospital
payments to the two facilities. The commissioner shall adjust this allotment as necessary based on
federal approvals, the amount of intergovernmental transfers received from Hennepin and Ramsey
Counties, and other factors, in order to maximize the additional total payments. The commissioner
shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic intergovernmental transfers

necessary to match federal Medicaid payments available under this subdivision in order to make
supplementary medical assistance payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions
Hospital equal to an amount that when combined with existing medical assistance payments
to nonstate governmental hospitals would increase total payments to hospitals in this category
for outpatient services to the aggregate upper payment limit for all hospitals in this category in
Minnesota. Upon receipt of these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary
payments to Hennepin County Medical Center and Regions Hospital.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 3, the commissioner shall determine
an upper payment limit for physicians affiliated with Hennepin County Medical Center and
with Regions Hospital. The upper payment limit shall be based on the average commercial rate
or be determined using another method acceptable to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services. The commissioner shall inform Hennepin County and Ramsey County of the periodic
intergovernmental transfers necessary to match the federal Medicaid payments available under
this subdivision in order to make supplementary payments to physicians affiliated with Hennepin
County Medical Center and Regions Hospital equal to the difference between the established
medical assistance payment for physician services and the upper payment limit. Upon receipt of
these periodic transfers, the commissioner shall make supplementary payments to physicians of
Hennepin Faculty Associates and HealthPartners.

share of the increase based on the pro rata share of medical assistance admissions to Hennepin

health plans shall submit individual-level cost data for verification purposes. The commissioner may
ratably reduce these payments on a pro rata basis in order to satisfy federal requirements for actuarial
soundness. If payments are reduced, transfers shall be reduced accordingly. Any licensed health plan
that receives increased medical assistance capitation payments under the intergovernmental transfer
described in this paragraph shall increase its medical assistance payments to Hennepin County
Medical Center and Regions Hospital by the same amount as the increased payments received in
the capitation payment described in this paragraph.

the need for any changes needed in the intergovernmental transfers in order to continue the payments
under paragraphs (a) to (c), at their maximum level, including increases in upper payment limits,
changes in the federal Medicaid match, and other factors.
   (e) The payments in paragraphs (a) to (c) shall be implemented independently of each other,
subject to federal approval and to the receipt of transfers under subdivision 3.

PAYMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Federal approval required. This section is effective for federal fiscal year
2010 and future years contingent on federal approval of the voluntary intergovernmental transfers
and payments authorized under this section and contingent on payment of the intergovernmental
transfers under this section.
   Subd. 2. Eligible nonstate government hospitals. (a) Hennepin County Medical Center and
Regions Hospital are eligible nonstate government hospitals.
    (b) If the commissioner obtains federal approval to include other hospitals, including University
of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, and SMDC Medical Center, the commissioner may expand
the definition of eligible nonstate government hospitals to include other hospitals.
    Subd. 3. Commissioner's duties. (a) For the purposes of this subdivision, the commissioner
shall determine the fee-for-service inpatient hospital services upper payment limit for nonstate
government hospitals. The commissioner shall determine, for each eligible nonstate government
hospital, the amount of a supplemental payment for inpatient hospital services that would increase
medical assistance spending for each eligible nonstate government hospital up to the amount that
Medicare would pay for the Medicaid fee-for-service inpatient hospital services provided by that
hospital. If the combined amount of such supplemental payment amounts and existing medical
assistance payments for inpatient hospital services to all nonstate government hospitals is less than
the upper payment limit, the commissioner shall increase the supplemental payment amount for
each eligible nonstate government hospital in proportion to the initial supplemental payments in
order to maximize the additional total payments.
   (b) The commissioner shall inform each eligible nonstate government hospital and associated
governmental entities of voluntary intergovernmental transfers necessary to provide the nonfederal
share for the supplemental payment amount attributable to each eligible nonstate government
hospital, as calculated under paragraph (a).
    (c) Upon receipt of a voluntary intergovernmental transfer from a governmental entity associated
with an eligible nonstate government hospital or from the eligible nonstate government hospital, the
commissioner shall make a supplemental payment, using the amounts calculated under paragraph
(a), to the associated eligible nonstate government hospital.
   (d) The commissioner may implement the payments in this section through use of periodic
payments and voluntary intergovernmental transfers.
   (e) The commissioner shall inform eligible nonstate government hospitals and associated
governmental entities on an ongoing basis of the need for any changes needed in the payment
amounts or voluntary intergovernmental transfers in order to continue the payments under
paragraph (c) at their maximum level, including increases in upper payment limits, changes in the
federal Medicaid match, and other factors.

     Sec. 11. [256D.031] GENERAL ASSISTANCE MEDICAL CARE.
   Subdivision 1. Eligibility. (a) Except as provided under subdivision 2, general assistance
medical care may be paid for any individual who is not eligible for medical assistance under
chapter 256B, including eligibility for medical assistance based on a spenddown of excess income
according to section 256B.056, subdivision 5, and who:
    (1) is receiving assistance under section 256D.05, except for families with children who are

    (2) is a resident of Minnesota and has gross countable income not in excess of 75 percent of
federal poverty guidelines for the family size, using a six-month budget period, and whose equity
in assets is not in excess of $1,000 per assistance unit.
Exempt assets, the reduction of excess assets, and the waiver of excess assets must conform to the
medical assistance program in section 256B.056, subdivisions 3 and 3d, except that the maximum
amount of undistributed funds in a trust that could be distributed to or on behalf of the beneficiary
by the trustee, assuming the full exercise of the trustee's discretion under the terms of the trust, must
be applied toward the asset maximum.
    (b) The commissioner shall adjust the income standards under this section each July 1 by
the annual update of the federal poverty guidelines following publication by the United States
Department of Health and Human Services.
    Subd. 2. Ineligible groups. (a) General assistance medical care may not be paid for an applicant

determining a disability or for determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social
Security Disability Insurance by the Social Security Administration.
    (b) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the
classes listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101, subsection (a), paragraph (15), and an
undocumented noncitizen is an individual who resides in the United States without approval or
acquiescence of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
    (d) General assistance medical care recipients who become eligible for medical assistance shall
be terminated from general assistance medical care and transferred to medical assistance.
    Subd. 2a. Transitional MinnesotaCare. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), effective for
applications received on or after April 1, 2010, and before June 1, 2010, all applicants who meet
the eligibility requirements in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and who are not described in
subdivision 2 shall be enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 7, immediately
following approval for general assistance medical care.
    (b) If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, general assistance medical
care may be paid for individuals identified in paragraph (a) for a temporary period beginning the
date of application in accordance with subdivision 4. Notwithstanding subdivision 7, paragraph (c),
eligibility for general assistance medical care shall continue until enrollment in MinnesotaCare is
completed. Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility
for general assistance medical care shall be sent to the applicant. Once enrolled in MinnesotaCare,
the MinnesotaCare-covered services as described in section 256L.03 shall apply for the remainder
of the six-month general assistance medical care eligibility period until their six-month renewal.
     (c) This subdivision does not apply if the applicant:
    (1) has applied for and is awaiting a determination of blindness or disability by the state medical
review team or a determination of eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security
Disability Insurance by the Social Security Administration;
     (2) is homeless as defined by United States Code, title 42, section 11301, et seq.;
     (3) is classified as an end-stage renal disease beneficiary in the Medicare program;
     (4) receives treatment funded in section 254B.02; or

Applicants and recipients who meet any one of these criteria shall remain eligible for general

assistance medical care and are not eligible to enroll in MinnesotaCare until the next renewal
period.
   (d) To be eligible for general assistance medical care following enrollment in MinnesotaCare as
required in paragraph (a), an individual must complete a new application.
    (e) This subdivision expires June 1, 2010. For any applicant or recipient who meets the
requirements of this subdivision before June 1, 2010, the commissioner shall continue the process
of enrolling the individual in MinnesotaCare and, upon the completion of enrollment, the individual
shall receive services under MinnesotaCare in accordance with paragraph (b).
    Subd. 3. Eligibility and enrollment procedures. (a) Eligibility for general assistance medical
care shall begin no earlier than the date of application. The date of application shall be the date
the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social Security number, signed and dated, to the
county agency or the Department of Human Services. If the applicant is unable to provide a name,
address, Social Security number, and signature when health care is delivered due to a medical
condition or disability, a health care provider may act on an applicant's behalf to establish the date
of an application by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider
identification and a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the
remainder of the application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined.
The applicant must complete the application within the time periods required under the medical
assistance program as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0015, subpart 5; and 9505.0090,
subpart 2. The county agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (b) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
     (c) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under subdivision 1, paragraph
(a), clause (2), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under subdivision 1, paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market
value within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during
the period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been
for the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value
at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received.
For any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months,
shall be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per
person payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
74TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010                                           7769

    (d) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include the noncitizen's sponsor's income and
resources as defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of
1996, title IV, Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
    (e) Applicants and recipients are eligible for general assistance medical care for a six-month
eligibility period, unless a change that affects eligibility is reported. Eligibility may be renewed for
additional six-month periods. During each six-month eligibility period, recipients who continue to
meet the eligibility requirements of this section are not eligible for MinnesotaCare.

   (b) Sex reassignment surgery is not covered under this section.

drugs when used for the treatment of mental illness.
    (e) Co-payments shall be limited to one per day per provider for nonemergency visits to a
hospital-based emergency room. Recipients of general assistance medical care are responsible
for all co-payments in this subdivision. Reimbursement for prescription drugs shall be reduced

Providers may not deny services to recipients who are unable to pay the co-payment.
    (f) Chemical dependency services that are reimbursed under chapter 254B shall not be

   (g) Inpatient hospital services that are provided in community behavioral health hospitals

    Subd. 5. Payment rates and contract modification; April 1, 2010, to May 31, 2010. (a) For
the period April 1, 2010, to May 31, 2010, general assistance medical care shall be paid on a

    Subd. 6. Coordinated care delivery systems. (a) Effective June 1, 2010, the commissioner
shall contract with hospitals or groups of hospitals that qualify under paragraph (b) and agree to
deliver services according to this subdivision. Contracting hospitals shall develop and implement a
74TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010                                         7771

coordinated care delivery system to provide health care services to individuals who are eligible for
general assistance medical care under this section and who either choose to receive services through
the coordinated care delivery system or who are enrolled by the commissioner under paragraph
(c). The health care services provided by the system must include: (1) the services described in
subdivision 4 with the exception of outpatient prescription drug coverage but shall include drugs
administered in a clinic or other outpatient setting; or (2) a set of comprehensive and medically
necessary health services that the recipients might reasonably require to be maintained in good
health and that has been approved by the commissioner, including at a minimum, but not limited
to, emergency care, emergency ground ambulance transportation services, inpatient hospital and
physician care, outpatient health services, preventive health services, mental health services, and
prescription drugs administered in a clinic or other outpatient setting. Outpatient prescription drug
coverage is covered on a fee-for-service basis in accordance with section 256D.03, subdivision 3,
and funded under subdivision 9. A hospital establishing a coordinated care delivery system under
this subdivision must ensure that the requirements of this subdivision are met.
   (b) A hospital or group of hospitals may contract with the commissioner to develop and
implement a coordinated care delivery system as follows:
    (1) effective June 1, 2010, a hospital qualifies under this subdivision if: (i) during calendar year
2008, it received fee-for-service payments for services to general assistance medical care recipients
(A) equal to or greater than $1,500,000, or (B) equal to or greater than 1.3 percent of net patient
revenue; or (ii) a contract with the hospital is necessary to provide geographic access or to ensure
that at least 80 percent of enrollees have access to a coordinated care delivery system; and
    (2) effective December 1, 2010, a Minnesota hospital not qualified under clause (1) may
contract with the commissioner under this subdivision if it agrees to satisfy the requirements of
this subdivision.
Participation by hospitals shall become effective quarterly on June 1, September 1, December 1,
or March 1. Hospital participation is effective for a period of 12 months and may be renewed for
successive 12-month periods.
    (c) Applicants and recipients may enroll in any available coordinated care delivery system
statewide. If more than one coordinated care delivery system is available, the applicant or recipient
shall be allowed to choose among the systems. The commissioner may assign an applicant or
recipient to a coordinated care delivery system if no choice is made by the applicant or recipient.
The commissioner shall consider a recipient's zip code, city of residence, county of residence,
or distance from a participating coordinated care delivery system when determining default
assignment. An applicant or recipient may decline enrollment in a coordinated care delivery
system. Upon enrollment into a coordinated care delivery system, the recipient must agree to
receive all nonemergency services through the coordinated care delivery system. Enrollment in a
coordinated care delivery system is for six months and may be renewed for additional six-month
periods, except that initial enrollment is for six months or until the end of a recipient's period of
general assistance medical care eligibility, whichever occurs first. A recipient who continues to
meet the eligibility requirements of this section is not eligible to enroll in MinnesotaCare during
a period of enrollment in a coordinated care delivery system. From June 1, 2010, to November
30, 2010, applicants and recipients not enrolled in a coordinated care delivery system may seek
services from a hospital eligible for reimbursement under the temporary uncompensated care pool
established under subdivision 8. After November 30, 2010, services are available only through a
7772                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [74TH DAY

coordinated care delivery system.
    (d) The hospital may contract and coordinate with providers and clinics for the delivery of
services and shall contract with essential community providers as defined under section 62Q.19,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), to the extent practicable. If a provider or clinic
contracts with a hospital to provide services through the coordinated care delivery system, the
provider may not refuse to provide services to any recipient enrolled in the system, and payment for
services shall be negotiated with the hospital and paid by the hospital from the system's allocation
under subdivision 7.
   (e) A coordinated care delivery system must:
    (1) provide the covered services required under paragraph (a) to recipients enrolled in the
coordinated care delivery system, and comply with the requirements of subdivision 4, paragraphs
(b) to (g);
   (2) establish a process to monitor enrollment and ensure the quality of care provided; and
    (3) in cooperation with counties, coordinate the delivery of health care services with existing
homeless prevention, supportive housing, and rent subsidy programs and funding administered by
the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency under chapter 462A; and
    (4) adopt innovative and cost-effective methods of care delivery and coordination, which may
include the use of allied health professionals, telemedicine, patient educators, care coordinators, and
community health workers.
    (f) The hospital may require a recipient to designate a primary care provider or a primary care
clinic. The hospital may limit the delivery of services to a network of providers who have contracted
with the hospital to deliver services in accordance with this subdivision, and require a recipient
to seek services only within this network. The hospital may also require a referral to a provider
before the service is eligible for payment. A coordinated care delivery system is not required to
provide payment to a provider who is not employed by or under contract with the system for services
provided to a recipient enrolled in the system, except in cases of an emergency. For purposes of this
section, emergency services are defined in accordance with Code of Federal Regulations, title 42,
section 438.114(a).
   (g) A recipient enrolled in a coordinated care delivery system has the right to appeal to the
commissioner according to section 256.045.
   (h) The state shall not be liable for the payment of any cost or obligation incurred by the
coordinated care delivery system.
    (i) The hospital must provide the commissioner with data necessary for assessing enrollment,
quality of care, cost, and utilization of services. Each hospital must provide, on a quarterly basis on
a form prescribed by the commissioner for each recipient served by the coordinated care delivery
system, the services provided, the cost of services provided, and the actual payment amount for the
services provided and any other information the commissioner deems necessary to claim federal
Medicaid match.

74TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 15, 2010                                       7773

drug coverage, provided on or after June 1, 2010, through a coordinated care delivery system, the
commissioner shall allocate the annual appropriation for the coordinated care delivery system to
hospitals participating under subdivision 6 in quarterly payments, beginning on the first scheduled
warrant on or after June 1, 2010. The payment shall be allocated among all hospitals qualified
to participate on the allocation date. Each hospital or group of hospitals shall receive a pro rata
share of the allocation based on the hospital's or group of hospitals' calendar year 2008 payments
for general assistance medical care services, provided that, for the purposes of this allocation,
payments to Hennepin County Medical Center, Regions Hospital, and University of Minnesota
Medical Center, Fairview, shall be weighted at 110 percent of the actual amount. The commissioner
may prospectively reallocate payments to participating hospitals on a biannual basis to ensure that
final allocations reflect actual coordinated care delivery system enrollment. The 2008 base year
shall be updated by one calendar year each June 1, beginning June 1, 2011.
    (b) In order to be reimbursed under this section, nonhospital providers of health care services
shall contract with one or more hospitals described in paragraph (a) to provide services to general
assistance medical care recipients through the coordinated care delivery system established by the
hospital. The hospital shall reimburse bills submitted by nonhospital providers participating under
this paragraph at a rate negotiated between the hospital and the nonhospital provider.
    (c) The commissioner shall apply for federal matching funds under section 256B.199, paragraphs
(a) to (d), for expenditures under this subdivision.
   (d) Outpatient prescription drug coverage is provided in accordance with section 256D.03,
subdivision 3, and paid on a fee-for-service basis under subdivision 9.
    Subd. 8. Temporary uncompensated care pool. (a) The commissioner shall establish a
temporary uncompensated care pool, effective June 1, 2010. Payments from the pool must be
distributed, within the limits of the available appropriation, to hospitals that are not part of a
coordinated care delivery system established under subdivision 6.
    (b) Hospitals seeking reimbursement from this pool must submit an invoice to the commissioner
in a form prescribed by the commissioner for payment for services provided to an applicant or
recipient not enrolled in a coordinated care delivery system. A payment amount, as calculated under
current law, must be determined, but not paid, for each admission of or service provided to a general
assistance medical care recipient on or after June 1, 2010, to November 30, 2010.
    (c) The aggregated payment amounts for each hospital must be calculated as a percentage of the
total calculated amount for all hospitals.
    (d) Distributions from the uncompensated care pool for each hospital must be determined by
multiplying the factor in paragraph (c) by the amount of money in the uncompensated care pool that
is available for the six-month period.
    (e) The commissioner shall apply for federal matching funds under section 256B.199, paragraphs
(a) to (d), for expenditures under this subdivision.
   (f) Outpatient prescription drugs are not eligible for payment under this subdivision.
   Subd. 9. Prescription drug pool. (a) The commissioner shall establish an outpatient
prescription drug pool, effective June 1, 2010. Money in the pool must be used to reimburse
pharmacies and other pharmacy service providers as defined in Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0340,
7774                                            JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                      [74TH DAY

for the covered outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to recipients. Payment for drugs shall be
on a fee-for-service basis according to the rates established in section 256B.0625, subdivision
13e. Outpatient prescription drug coverage is subject to the availability of funds in the pool. If
the commissioner forecasts that expenditures under this subdivision will exceed the appropriation
for this purpose, the commissioner may bring recommendations to the Legislative Advisory
Commission on methods to resolve the shortfall.
    (b) Effective June 1, 2010, coordinated care delivery systems established under subdivision 6
shall pay to the commissioner, on a quarterly basis, an assessment equal to 20 percent of payments
for the prescribed drugs for recipients of services through that coordinated care delivery system, as
calculated by the commissioner based on the most recent available data.
    Subd. 10. Assistance for veterans. Hospitals participating in the coordinated care delivery
system under subdivision 6 shall consult with counties, county veterans service officers, and the
Veterans Administration to identify other programs for which general assistance medical care
recipients enrolled in their system are qualified.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for services rendered on or after April 1, 2010.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.05, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Effective date of coverage. (a) The effective date of coverage is the first day of the
month following the month in which eligibility is approved and the first premium payment has
been received. As provided in section 256B.057, coverage for newborns is automatic from the date
of birth and must be coordinated with other health coverage. The effective date of coverage for
eligible newly adoptive children added to a family receiving covered health services is the month
of placement. The effective date of coverage for other new members added to the family is the first
day of the month following the month in which the change is reported. All eligibility criteria must
be met by the family at the time the new family member is added. The income of the new family
member is included with the family's gross income and the adjusted premium begins in the month
the new family member is added.
   (b) The initial premium must be received by the last working day of the month for coverage to
begin the first day of the following month.
    (c) Benefits are not available until the day following discharge if an enrollee is hospitalized on
the first day of coverage.
    (d) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, benefits under sections 256L.01 to 256L.18
are secondary to a plan of insurance or benefit program under which an eligible person may have
coverage and the commissioner shall use cost avoidance techniques to ensure coordination of any
other health coverage for eligible persons. The commissioner shall identify eligible persons who
may have coverage or benefits under other plans of insurance or who become eligible for medical
assistance.

     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.05, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Renewal of eligibility. (a) Beginning July 1, 2007, an enrollee's eligibility must be
renewed every 12 months. The 12-month period begins in the month after the month the application
is approved.
    (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The commissioner may establish criteria and timelines for sites to
forward applications to the commissioner or county agencies. The premium for the new period of
eligibility must be received as provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
