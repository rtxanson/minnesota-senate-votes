and the Sergeant at Arms of the House shall be the Sergeant at Arms of the Convention.
                                    PRESIDENT'S DUTIES

subject to an appeal to the Convention by any member. The President shall rise to put a question but

                                  CALLING MEMBER TO ORDER
     1.06 If any member of the Joint Convention is called to order for offensive words in debate, the
member calling to order shall report the words to which exception is taken and the Secretary shall
record them. No member may be called to order for any language used in debate if exception is not
taken before any other member has spoken or any other business has taken place. A member called

In any case, the Joint Convention, if appealed to, shall decide without debate. Only if the decision

                                                   FORM
   2.01 The title of each bill shall clearly state its subject and briefly state its purpose. When a bill
amends or repeals an existing act, the title shall refer to the chapter, section or subdivision.
    Reference shall be made to Minnesota Statutes for the provisions appearing therein unless
reference to previous session laws is required for some special reason.
   Bills shall refer to Minnesota Statutes as follows:
   "Minnesota Statutes .........., section .........."
18TH DAY]                                MONDAY, MARCH 9, 2009                                     503

   Bills shall refer to the session laws as follows:
   "Laws .........., chapter .........., section .........."
    A bill for the amendment of a statute shall contain the full text of the section or subdivision to
be amended as it appears in the latest edition of Minnesota Statutes unless it has been amended, in
which event it shall contain the full text as amended.
    The words and characters constituting the amending matter shall be inserted in the proper
place in the text and underscored. The words and characters to be eliminated by the amendment
shall be stricken by drawing a line through them. The text of a new section or subdivision shall
also be underscored when a bill amends an existing chapter or section by adding a new section or
subdivision. In the omnibus appropriation bills required by Joint Rule 2.02, sections making an
appropriation or transfer and not amending a statute or session law need not have new material
underscored. Before a committee favorably reports upon a bill, the chair of the committee shall
see that the bill conforms to this rule. When a bill is printed in the Journal, the new matter shall be
in italics or underscored and the matter to be eliminated shall be capitalized and in parentheses or
stricken by drawing a line through it. A bill drafted by the Revisor of Statutes for the purposes of
correcting errors in Minnesota Statutes need not comply with the provisions of this paragraph if
the bill is labeled "REVISOR'S BILL" immediately below the title, and if there is attached thereto
a memorandum of information explaining the reasons for the bill.
    If the bill is for an original law and not for an amendment of an existing law, the sections and
subdivisions shall be arranged, subdivided, and numbered in like manner as Minnesota Statutes.
If such a bill assigns to the sections thereof headnotes or identification by the decimal system of
numbering used in Minnesota Statutes, such headnotes and decimal identification may be submitted
by standing committee chairs to the Revisor of Statutes for examination. Any such headnotes shall
be capital letters enclosed in brackets, and shall be subject to the provisions of Minnesota Statutes,
section 648.36.
    All numbers in titles shall be expressed in figures. All numbers of section or chapter of law shall
be in figures. In the body of a bill numbers in excess of ten shall be in figures, except for a special
reason they may be written, but when written they shall not be followed by numbers or parentheses.
   A bill may include or be accompanied by a table of contents.
    A bill that repeals a statute may include or be accompanied by an appendix containing the full
text of the section or subdivision repealed.
    A bill containing a constitutional amendment may only contain the statutory language and
changes necessary to conduct the constitutional election and to implement the constitutional
amendment, should it pass. Extraneous statutory changes or additional topics may not be included
in a bill proposing a constitutional amendment.
                                        APPROPRIATING MONEY
    2.02 The same bill shall not appropriate public money or property to more than one local or
private purpose.
   No clause appropriating money for a local or private purpose shall be contained in a bill
appropriating money for the State government or public institutions.
504                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [18TH DAY

   All resolutions authorizing the issuing of abstracts by the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief
Clerk of the House for the payment of money shall be upon the call of "yeas" and "nays."
                                           DEADLINES
   2.03 The Legislature shall establish by concurrent resolution deadlines for each regular session.
The deadlines do not apply to the House committees on Capital Investment, Ways and Means,
Taxes, or Rules and Legislative Administration, nor to the Senate committees on Capital Investment,
Finance, Taxes, or Rules and Administration.
   The first deadline is for committees to act favorably on bills in the house of origin.
    The second deadline is for committees to act favorably on bills, or companions of bills, that met
the first deadline in the other house.
    A committee has until the second deadline to act favorably on a bill, or the companion of a
bill, that by the first deadline was referred to a finance committee. The deadline for a committee of
either house to act on a bill that has been recommended favorably by the Legislative Commission
on Pensions and Retirement is the second committee deadline. The major appropriation bills are
exempt from the first two deadlines.
   The third deadline is for committees to act favorably on major appropriation and finance bills.
   When a committee in either house acts favorably on a bill after a deadline established in the
concurrent resolution, the bill must be referred in the Senate to the Committee on Rules and
Administration and in the House of Representatives to the Committee on Rules and Legislative
Administration for disposition. Either rules committee, when reporting a bill referred to the
committee under this rule, may waive application of the rule to subsequent actions on that bill by
other committees.
   All bills necessary to implement the governor's budget submitted by a state agency or
department must be introduced within 15 calendar days after the governor's budget was submitted.
A bill introduced after that date must be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration
in the Senate or the Committee on Rules and Legislative Administration in the House of
Representatives and may not be heard without the approval of that committee.
                  AMENDING BILLS ORIGINATING IN OTHER HOUSE
   2.04 Either house shall have the power to amend any bill, memorial, or resolution passed by the
other house.
                                 RECEDING FROM POSITION
    2.05 Prior to a Conference Committee on any matter, either house may recede from its position
on any difference existing between the two houses. In order to recede, and if the matter is not in the
possession of a house, that house shall request return of the matter from the other house. To recede,
a majority of a house shall govern, except in cases otherwise provided in the Constitution. If the
question is put and lost, it shall not be put again on the same day. A reconsideration of the question
shall in all respects be regulated by the rules of that house.

    2.06 In all cases of disagreement between the Senate and House on amendments adopted by
either house to a bill, memorial or resolution passed by the other house, a Conference Committee
consisting of not less than three members nor more than five members from each house may be
requested by either house. The other house shall appoint a similar committee.
     The manner of procedure shall be as follows: The house of origin passes a bill and transmits it
to the other body. If the other body adopts an amendment to the bill and passes it as amended, it
shall return the bill with a record of its actions to the house of origin. If the house of origin refuses
to concur in the amendment, it shall ask for a Conference Committee, appoint such a committee on
its part, and transmit the bill with a record of its action to the other house. If the other house adheres
to its amendment, it shall appoint a like committee and return the bill to the house of origin.
   All Conference Committees shall be open to the public.
    As much as practical, meetings of Conference Committees shall be announced as far in advance
as possible and actions taken shall be agreed upon in an open meeting. At an agreed upon hour
the Conference Committee shall meet. The members from each house shall state to the members
from the other house, orally or in writing, the reason for their respective positions. The members
shall confer thereon. A conference committee may not meet between the hours of midnight and
7:00 a.m., except that a committee may extend a meeting for up to one hour past midnight by a
vote of two-thirds of the members appointed to the committee by each house. The chair shall rotate
between the Senate and the House of Representatives at least every calendar day, Sundays and
holidays excepted. The conferees shall report to their respective houses the agreement they have
reached, or, if none, the fact of a disagreement.
    If an agreement is reported, the house of origin shall act first upon the report. A Conference
Committee report must be limited to provisions that are germane to the bill and amendments that
were referred to the Conference Committee. A provision is not germane if it relates to a substantially
different subject or is intended to accomplish a substantially different purpose from that of the bill
and amendment that were referred to the Conference Committee.
    A Conference Committee report may not appropriate a larger sum of money than the larger of
the bill or the amendments that were referred to the Conference Committee unless the additional
appropriation is authorized by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Majority Leader
of the Senate.
    A Conference Committee report may not delegate rulemaking to a department or agency of
state government or exempt a department or agency of state government from rulemaking unless
the delegation or exemption was included in either the bill or the amendment that was referred to
the Conference Committee.
    A Conference Committee report may not create a new commission, council, task force, board,
or other body to which a member of the legislature may be appointed unless the body was created
in either the bill or the amendment that was referred to the Conference Committee.
    If the report is adopted and repassed as amended by the Conference Committee by the house of
origin, the report, the bill and a record of its action shall be transmitted to the other house.
   Except after the last Thursday on which the Legislature can meet in regular session in
odd-numbered years, and after the last Thursday on which the Legislature intended, when it adopted

the concurrent resolution required by Rule 2.03, to meet in regular session in even-numbered years,
a written or electronic copy of a report of a Conference Committee shall be placed on the desk
of each member of a house, or delivered electronically, twelve hours before action on the report
by that house. If the report has been reprinted in the Journal of either house for a preceding day
and is available to the members, the Journal copy shall serve as the written report. The member
presenting the Conference Committee report to the body shall disclose, either in writing or orally,
the substantial changes from the bill or the amendment as they were last before the body.
                               ENROLLMENT AND SIGNATURE
    2.07 After a bill or memorial or joint resolution has been passed by both houses, it shall be
carefully and properly enrolled by the Revisor of Statutes under the direction of the Secretary of the
Senate for a matter originating in the Senate or the Chief Clerk of the House for a matter originating
in the House.
    The enrollment shall be prepared on archival quality paper approximately 8 1/2" x 14" in size
and may be produced by means of a copying machine. An enrolled bill shall be labeled "An Act" but
otherwise shall be identical to the bill passed by the Legislature. Other enrollments shall be identical
to the memorial or joint resolution passed by the legislature.
    The Revisor of Statutes shall obtain the signatures and certificates of the proper officers to the
enrollment. A joint resolution applying to the Congress of the United States to call a convention
for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States, ratifying an amendment to
the Constitution of the United States, proposing an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution, or
prescribing the compensation of judges shall not be presented to the Governor for approval but shall
be deposited by the Revisor of Statutes with the Secretary of State. All other enrollments shall be
presented to the Governor for approval.

                                SUSPENSION OF JOINT RULES
    3.01 Either house may suspend the Joint Rules of the Senate and House by a vote of two-thirds
of its members.
                            ODD YEAR SESSION ADJOURNMENT
    3.02 Adjournment of the regular session in any odd-numbered year to a date certain in the
following year shall be equivalent to daily adjournment, except that upon adjournment in any
odd-numbered year to a date certain in the following year:
    (a) Any bill being considered by a Conference Committee shall be returned to the house of
origin, laid on the table, and the Conference Committee shall be discharged;
    (b) Any bill referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration in the Senate or the
Committee on Rules and Legislative Administration in the House pursuant to Joint Rule 2.03 shall
be returned to the standing committee to which it was last previously referred; and
    (c) Any bill returned by the Governor to the house of origin with the Governor's objections
following the adjournment shall be laid on the table.

    3.03 Except as otherwise provided by law, the report of any interim committee or commission
to the Legislature shall be submitted on paper 8 1/2" x 11" in size, spiral bound, stapled, or punched
on the left edge to fit a standard size three ring binder intended for that size paper. A brief summary
of the recommendations of the commission or committee shall appear first and be clearly separated
from its findings, discussions, and exhibits. If the report contains legislative recommendations, a
copy of any proposed legislation, particularly if extensive in character, shall if possible be attached
as an exhibit at the end of the report.

    4.02 At the Joint Convention of the Senate and House of Representatives called to elect regents,
the joint committee shall report the name of the person or persons recommended for each seat.
These persons are considered to be nominated. Any member of the legislature may submit additional
nominations. If there is more than one at-large seat to be filled, all candidates nominated for an
at-large seat are candidates for any of the at-large seats.
   The roll shall be called viva voce on the election of regents. The roll must be called first on
congressional district seats until they are filled, then on the student seat, and then on the at-large

seats.
   Each member may cast one vote for each seat to be filled, but no more than one vote for a
candidate.
    The candidate for each seat receiving a majority of the votes cast must be declared elected. If
there is more than one at-large seat to be filled and more than one candidate who receives a majority
of the votes cast, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes must be declared elected; in
case of a tie for the highest number of votes, the votes must be cast again. If no candidate receives
a majority of the votes cast for a seat, on each succeeding ballot the candidate with the fewest votes
must be dropped from consideration and the votes cast again until a majority vote is achieved. Any
candidate with fewer than 20 votes on any ballot shall also be dropped on succeeding ballots.
   Senator Pogemiller moved that Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6 be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.
                                             RECESS
    Senator Pogemiller moved that the Senate do now recess until immediately after the conclusion
of the Joint Convention to elect members of the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota.
The motion prevailed.
   The Senate reconvened at the appropriate time.

                                     CALL OF THE SENATE
    Senator Pogemiller imposed a call of the Senate. The Sergeant at Arms was instructed to bring
in the absent members.

                      MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS - CONTINUED

   Senator Pogemiller moved that Senate Concurrent No. 6 be taken from the table. The motion
prevailed.
   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6: A Senate concurrent resolution adopting Permanent Joint
Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.
   Senator Marty moved to amend Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6 as follows:
    Page 6, line 30, after the period, insert "From the time a conference committee is appointed
until it is disbanded, any negotiations between senate and house of representatives members of
the Conference Committee or senate and house of representatives staff members related to the
Conference Committee or the bill referred to the conference committee must be open to the public.
Explaining a provision of a bill is not negotiation unless the provision is in dispute."
   Page 8, after line 18, insert:
                                     "OPEN NEGOTIATIONS
   2.08 (a) A meeting between the majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the house to set
budget targets or negotiate the state budget must be open to the public.

    (b) A meeting with the governor to negotiate a bill pending in the senate or house of
representatives or to set budget targets or negotiate the state budget must be open to the public if
the meeting includes any of the following members of the legislature:
   (1) the majority leader of the senate;
   (2) the speaker of the house;
   (3) the minority leader of either the senate or house of representatives; or
   (4) the chair of a standing committee or division of the senate or house of representatives.
   (c) Explaining a provision of a bill is not negotiation unless the provision is in dispute."
    Senator Marty moved to amend the Marty amendment to Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6
as follows:
   Page 1, line 8, delete "unless the provision is in dispute"
   Page 1, line 21, delete "unless the provision is in"
   Page 1, line 22, delete "dispute"
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment to the amendment was adopted.
