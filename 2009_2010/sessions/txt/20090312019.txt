that deliberately providing false information is a felony punishable by not more than five years
imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000, or both."
    (b) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster, confirm the applicant's name, address, and
date of birth.
    (c) After the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the applicant a voter's receipt. The
voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right
to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be
maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest.
    Sec. 7. [243.205] NOTICE OF RESTORATION OF RIGHT TO VOTE.
    Subdivision 1. Correctional facilities; designation of official. The chief executive officer of
each state and local correctional facility shall designate an official within the facility to provide the
notice and application required under this section to inmates who have been restored to civil rights.
The official shall maintain an adequate supply of voter registration applications and informational
materials for this purpose.
   Subd. 2. Notice requirement. A notice of restoration of civil rights and a voter registration
application must be provided as follows:
    (1) the chief executive officer of each state and local correctional facility shall provide the
notice and application to an inmate being released from the facility following incarceration for a
felony-level offense; and
    (2) a probation officer or supervised release agent shall provide the notice and application to all
individuals under correctional supervision for a felony-level offense.
    Subd. 3. Form of notice. The notice required by subdivision 2 must appear substantially as
follows:
       "NOTICE OF RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT
                               TO VOTE.
    Your receipt of this notice today means that your civil rights have been automatically restored.
This includes a restoration of your right to vote in Minnesota. Before you can vote on election day,
you still need to register to vote. To register, you can complete a voter registration application and
return it to the Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State. You can also register to vote in your

polling place on election day. You will not be permitted to cast a ballot until you register to vote.
The first time you appear at your polling place to cast a ballot, you may be required to provide proof
of your current residence."
   Subd. 4. Failure to provide notice. A failure to provide proper notice as required by this section
does not prevent the restoration of the person's civil rights.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.165, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Restoration. (a) When a person has been deprived of civil rights by reason of
conviction of a crime and is thereafter discharged, such discharge shall restore the person to all civil
rights and to full citizenship, w

that are culturally competent, child-centered, and family-driven to achieve maximum benefit for the
client. The provider entity must review, and update as necessary, the clinical policies and procedures
every three years and must distribute the policies and procedures to staff initially and upon each
subsequent update.
   (b) The clinical infrastructure written policies and procedures must include policies and
procedures for:
    (1) providing or obtaining a client's diagnostic assessment that identifies acute and chronic
clinical disorders, co-occurring medical conditions, sources of psychological and environmental
problems, ­ an

clearly summarize the client's individual strengths and needs;
   (2) developing an individual treatment plan that is:
   (i) based on the information in the client's diagnostic assessment;
    (ii) developed no later than the end of the first psychotherapy session after the completion
of the client's diagnostic assessment by the mental health professional who provides the client's
psychotherapy;
    (iii) developed through a child-centered, family-driven planning process that identifies service
needs and individualized, planned, and culturally appropriate interventions that contain specific
treatment goals and objectives for the client and the client's family or foster family;
   (iv) reviewed at least once every 90 days and revised, if necessary; and
    (v) signed by the client or, if appropriate, by the client's parent or other person authorized by
statute to consent to mental health services for the client;
   (3) developing an individual behavior plan that documents services to be provided by the mental
health behavioral aide. The individual behavior plan must include:
   (i) detailed instructions on the service to be provided;
   (ii) time allocated to each service;
   (iii) methods of documenting the child's behavior;
   (iv) methods of monitoring the child's progress in reaching objectives; and
   (v) goals to increase or decrease targeted behavior as identified in the individual treatment plan;
    (4) clinical supervision of the mental health practitioner and mental health behavioral aide.
A mental health professional must document the clinical supervision the professional provides
by cosigning individual treatment plans and making entries in the client's record on supervisory
activities. Clinical supervision does not include the authority to make or terminate court-ordered
placements of the child. A clinical supervisor must be available for urgent consultation as required
by the individual client's needs or the situation. Clinical supervision may occur individually or
in a small group to discuss treatment and review progress toward goals. The focus of clinical
supervision must be the client's treatment needs and progress and the mental health practitioner's

                   , the mental health professional is required to be present on site for observation as
clinically appropriate when the mental health practitioner is providing individual, family, or group
skills training to the child or the child's family; and
    (iii) when conducted, the observation must be a minimum of one clinical unit. The on-site
presence of the mental health professional must be documented in the child's record and signed by
the mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility;
     (5) providing direction to a mental health behavioral aide. For entities that employ mental health
behavioral aides, the clinical supervisor must be employed by the provider entity or other certified
children's therapeutic supports and services provider entity to ensure necessary and appropriate
oversight for the client's treatment and continuity of care. The mental health professional or mental
health practitioner giving direction must begin with the goals on the individualized treatment
plan, and instruct the mental health behavioral aide on how to construct therapeutic activities and
interventions that will lead to goal attainment. The professional or practitioner giving direction
must also instruct the mental health behavioral aide about the client's diagnosis, functional status,
and other characteristics that are likely to affect service delivery. Direction must also include
determining that the mental health behavioral aide has the skills to interact with the client and
the client's family in ways that convey personal and cultural respect and that the aide actively
solicits information relevant to treatment from the family. The aide must be able to clearly explain
the activities the aide is doing with the client and the activities' relationship to treatment goals.
Direction is more didactic than is supervision and requires the professional or practitioner providing
it to continuously evaluate the mental health behavioral aide's ability to carry out the activities of
the individualized treatment plan and the individualized behavior plan. When providing direction,
the professional or practitioner must:
   (i) review progress notes prepared by the mental health behavioral aide for accuracy and
consistency with diagnostic assessment, treatment plan, and behavior goals and the professional or

practitioner must approve and sign the progress notes;
   (ii) identify changes in treatment strategies, revise the individual behavior plan, and
communicate treatment instructions and methodologies as appropriate to ensure that treatment is
implemented correctly;
    (iii) demonstrate family-friendly behaviors that support healthy collaboration among the child,
the child's family, and providers as treatment is planned and implemented;
    (iv) ensure that the mental health behavioral aide is able to effectively communicate with the
child, the child's family, and the provider; and
  (v) record the results of any evaluation and corrective actions taken to modify the work of the
mental health behavioral aide;
   (6) providing service delivery that implements the individual treatment plan and meets the
requirements under subdivision 9; and
    (7) individual treatment plan review. The review must determine the extent to which the services
have met the goals and objectives in the previous treatment plan. The review must assess the client's
progress and ensure that services and treatment goals continue to be necessary and appropriate to
the client and the client's family or foster family. Revision of the individual treatment plan does not
require a new diagnostic assessment unless the client's mental health status has changed markedly.
The updated treatment plan must be signed by the client, if appropriate, and by the client's parent or
other person authorized by statute to give consent to the mental health services for the child.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Service delivery criteria. (a) In delivering services under this section, a certified
provider entity must ensure that:
    (1) each individual provider's caseload size permits the provider to deliver services to both
clients with severe, complex needs and clients with less intensive needs. The provider's caseload
size should reasonably enable the provider to play an active role in service planning, monitoring,
and delivering services to meet the client's and client's family's needs, as specified in each client's
individual treatment plan;
    (2) site-based programs, including day treatment and preschool programs, provide staffing and
facilities to ensure the client's health, safety, and protection of rights, and that the programs are able
to implement each client's individual treatment plan;
    (3) a day treatment program is provided to a group of clients by a multidisciplinary team under
the clinical supervision of a mental health professional. The day treatment program must be provided
in and by: (i) an outpatient hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health
Organizations and licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.55; (ii) a community mental health center
under section 245.62; and (iii) an entity that is under contract with the county board to operate a
program that meets the requirements of sections 245.4712, subdivision 2, and 245.4884, subdivision
2, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0170 to 9505.0475. The day treatment program must stabilize
the client's mental health status while developing and improving the client's independent living and
socialization skills. The goal of the day treatment program must be to reduce or relieve the effects
of mental illness and provide training to enable the client to live in the community. The program

and community living. A mental health behavioral aide must document the delivery of services in
written progress notes. The mental health behavioral aide must implement goals in the treatment
plan for the child's emotional disturbance that allow the child to acquire developmentally and
therapeutically appropriate daily living skills, social skills, and leisure and recreational skills
through targeted activities. These activities may include:
     (i) assisting a child as needed with skills development in dressing, eating, and toileting;
    (ii) assisting, monitoring, and guiding the child to complete tasks, including facilitating the
child's participation in medical appointments;

qualifications of staff providing supervision are described and meet the needs of the recipient.
Customized living services must not include rent or raw food costs. The negotiated payment rate
for 24-hour customized living services must be based on services to be provided. Negotiated rates
must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or medical assistance services and
must reflect economies of scale. The individually negotiated 24-hour customized living payments,
in combination with the payment for other elderly waiver services, including case management,
must not exceed the recipient's community budget cap specified in subdivision 3a.
    (b) Twenty-four hour customized living services are delivered by a provider licensed by the
commissioner of health as a class A or class F home care provider and provided in a building that is
registered as a housing with services establishment under chapter 144D. Those home care providers
with a capacity to serve 12 or fewer clients may provide nighttime supervision to clients using
personnel who have other duties and are located in an adjoining building if:

accordance with all applicable home care licensing requirements;
   (2) the provider has assessed the clients needing 24-hour supervision and determined that their
needs can be safely met;

   Subdivision 1. Applicability. The definitions in this section apply to sections 583.40 to 583.48.
     Subd. 2. Commence a foreclosure proceeding. "Commence a foreclosure proceeding" means
to file a notice of pendency under section 580.032 or commence a foreclosure action under chapter
581.
    Subd. 3. Send. "Send" means to deliver by certified mail or another method acknowledging
receipt.
   Subd. 4. Serve. "Serve" means personal service under the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure.
   Sec. 4. [583.41] APPLICABILITY.
   Subdivision 1. Creditors. (a) Sections 583.40 to 583.48 apply to a person who is the holder of
a mortgage to which section 580.021 applies.
    (b) Sections 583.40 to 583.48 do not apply to property if the holder of the mortgage, before
selling the property to the owner, occupied the property as the holder's principal place of residency.
    Subd. 2. Debtors. Sections 583.40 to 583.48 apply to a debtor who has received foreclosure
prevention counseling under section 580.021 and who has been verified as eligible for mediation
by an authorized foreclosure prevention counseling agency, or who files a mediation request under
section 583.42, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), indicating that the debtor did not receive the required
preforeclosure prevention counseling and mediation notice. Sections 583.40 to 583.48 do not apply
to a debtor who qualifies as a debtor under the Farmer-Lender Mediation Act.
    Subd. 3. Applicability. (a) Sections 583.40 to 583.48 do not apply to mortgages refinanced or

    Subdivision 1. Mediation request. (a) A debtor who wishes to participate in mediation must
send a mediation request form to the attorney general within seven days after receiving the form from
the counseling agency under section 580.021, subdivision 5. The debtor must disclose all known
creditors with debts secured by the property. A debtor who fails to send a timely mediation request
waives the right to mediation under sections 583.40 to 583.48 for that specific mortgage foreclosure.
Upon receipt of a mediation request, the attorney general must send a copy of the request to the
holder of the mortgage. The holder of the mortgage must not commence a foreclosure proceeding
against the property or proceed with a proceeding to which paragraph (b) applies until the stay of
the foreclosure is lifted or as otherwise authorized under sections 583.40 to 583.48.

the debtor's property, the debtor may send a mediation request to the attorney general at any time

foreclosure proceeding for 90 days after the debtor sends a mediation request to the attorney
general, except as otherwise allowed under sections 583.40 to 583.48; and

for the compensation of mediators who are qualified persons experienced in finance or negotiation.
    (b) A person is not eligible to be a mediator if the person has a conflict of interest that does not

   (1) attempt to mediate between the debtor and the creditors;
   (2) advise the debtor and creditors of assistance programs that are available;
   (3) attempt to arrive at an agreement to fairly adjust, refinance, or pay the mortgage debt; and

period, which may be up to 90 days after the debtor sends a mediation request to the attorney general.
    Subd. 7. Mediation agreement. (a) If an agreement is reached among the debtor and creditors,

creditors, and if applicable, submit the agreement to (1) the attorney general, and (2) any court that
has jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosure or redemption proceedings regarding the property.
  (b) The debtor and creditors who are parties to the approved mediation agreement and creditors
who have filed claim forms and have not objected to the mediation agreement:
   (1) are bound by the terms of the agreement; and
   (2) may enforce the mediation agreement as a legal contract.
   (c) A debtor may agree to allow a creditor to commence a mortgage foreclosure proceeding
against property that is subject to mediation before the proceeding is otherwise allowed under
subdivision 3, provided that the debtor or creditor may rescind the agreement within five business
days after that debtor and creditor both sign the agreement.
    Subd. 8. Termination of mediation. (a) The mediator must sign and serve on the parties and
the attorney general a termination statement by the end of the mediation period.
   (b) The mediator must prepare a termination statement acknowledging that mediation has ended
and that:
   (1) describes or references agreements reached between a creditor and the debtor, if any, and
agreements reached among creditors, if any; or
    (2) states that no agreement was reached between the parties, despite a good faith effort by the
parties, and that further negotiation would be futile.
   (c) Mediation agreements may be included as part of the termination statement.
   Sec. 6. [583.43] GOOD FAITH REQUIRED; COURT-SUPERVISED MEDIATION.
   Subdivision 1. Obligation of good faith. The parties must engage in mediation in good faith.
Not participating in good faith includes:
   (a) failure to attend and participate in mediation sessions without cause;
   (b) failure to provide full information regarding the financial obligations of the parties and
other creditors including the obligation of a creditor to provide information under section 583.42,
subdivision 3, paragraph (c);
   (c) failure of the creditor to designate a representative to participate in the mediation with
authority to make binding commitments;
    (d) lack of a written statement of debt restructuring alternatives and a statement of reasons why
alternatives are unacceptable to one of the parties; and
   (e) other similar behavior that evidences lack of good faith by a party. A failure to agree to
reduce, restructure, refinance, or forgive debt is not, in itself, evidence of lack of good faith by the
590                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [19TH DAY

creditor.
    Subd. 2. Party's bad faith; mediator's affidavit. If the mediator determines that either party
is not participating in good faith as defined in subdivision 1, the mediator must file an affidavit
indicating the reasons for the finding with the attorney general and with parties to the mediation.
    Subd. 3. Creditor's bad faith; court supervision. If the mediator finds the creditor has
not participated in mediation in good faith, the debtor may require court-supervised mandatory
mediation by filing the affidavit with the district court of the county of the debtor's residence with
a request for court supervision of mediation and serving a copy of the request on the creditor.
Upon request, the court must require both parties to mediate under the supervision of the court in
good faith for a period of not more than 90 days. All mortgage foreclosure proceedings must be
suspended during this period. The court may issue orders necessary to effect good faith mediation.
Following the mediation period, if the court finds the creditor has not participated in mediation in
good faith, the court must by order suspend the creditor's mortgage foreclosure proceeding for an
additional period of 90 days. A creditor found by the mediator not to have participated in good
faith must pay the attorney fees and costs of the debtor requesting court supervision.
    Subd. 4. Debtor's lack of good faith. A creditor may immediately commence or proceed with
a mortgage foreclosure proceeding upon receipt of a mediator's affidavit of a debtor's lack of good
faith, notwithstanding any other requirements of sections 583.40 to 583.48.
     Subd. 5. Review of good faith finding. (a) Upon petition by a debtor or creditor, a court may
review a mediator's decision regarding whether to file an affidavit of lack of good faith. The review
is limited to whether the mediator committed an abuse of discretion in filing, or failing to file, an
affidavit of lack of good faith. The petition must be reviewed by the court within ten days after the
petition is filed.
     (b) If the court finds that the mediator committed an abuse of discretion in filing, or failing to
file, an affidavit of lack of good faith, the court may:
   (1) reinstate mediation and the stay of creditor's mortgage foreclosure proceeding;
   (2) order court-supervised mediation; or
   (3) allow a creditor to proceed immediately with a mortgage foreclosure proceeding.
   Sec. 7. [583.44] CREDITOR NOT ATTENDING MEDIATION MEETING.
   Subdivision 1. Filing and effect of claim form. A creditor that is notified of the initial mediation
meeting is subject to and bound by a mediation agreement if the creditor does not attend mediation
meetings, unless the creditor files a claim form. In lieu of attending a mediation meeting, a creditor
may file a claim form with the mediator before the scheduled meeting. By filing a claim form the
creditor agrees to be bound by a mediation agreement reached at the mediation meeting unless an
objection is filed within the time specified in subdivision 2. The mediator must notify the creditors
who have filed claim forms of the terms of any agreement.
    Subd. 2. Objections to agreements. A creditor who has filed a claim form may serve a written
objection to the terms of the mediation agreement on the mediator and the debtor within ten days
after receiving notice of the mediation agreement. If a creditor files an objection to the terms of a
mediation agreement, the mediator must meet again with debtors and creditors within ten days after
19TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 2009                                          591

7, if an objection is filed, the mediator must call mediation meetings during the ten-day period
following receipt of the objection.

by the attorney general or mediators under sections 583.40 to 583.48 are private data on individuals
or nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9 or 12.

   Subd. 2. Forms. The attorney general must create standard mediation request and claim forms.

chapters 580 and 581.

from state contracts available through the cooperative purchasing venture under section 16C.10,

intermediate school districts, or from a regional service cooperative or a regional management

both professional and technical services and service performed under a service contract for school
district business management. It does not mean custodial, food, or transportation services.

required to purchase a good or business service according to subdivision 1 if the school district or
charter school can document that:
   (1) a lower price for comparable goods or business services is available from another vendor;

business service;

address where comments will be received by mail.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;

lessee; or
    (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of

such county auditor shall extend only such amount of taxes as the limitations herein prescribed will
permit; provided, if such levy shall include any levy for the payment of bonded indebtedness or
judgments, such levies for bonded indebtedness or judgments shall be extended in full, and the
remainder of the levies shall be reduced so that the total thereof, including levies for bonds and
judgments, shall not exceed such amount as the limitations herein prescribed will permit.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.62, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Report on taxes levied. The commissioner of revenue shall establish procedures
for the annual reporting of local government levies. Each local governmental unit shall submit a
report to the commissioner by December 30 of the year in which the tax is levied. The report shall
include, but is not limited to, information on the amount of the tax levied by the governmental unit
for the following purposes:
   (1) social services and related programs, which include taxes levied for the purposes defined in
Minnesota Statutes 1991 Supplement, section 275.50, subdivision 5, clauses (a), (j), and (v);
   (2) the amounts levied for each of the purposes listed in Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.70,
subdivision 5; and
    (3) other levies, which include the taxes levied for all purposes not included in clause (1), (2),
or (3).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 279.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Due dates; penalties. Except as provided in subdivision 3 or 4, on May 16 or
21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is
later, a penalty accrues and thereafter is charged upon all unpaid taxes on real estate on the current
lists in the hands of the county treasurer. The penalty is at a rate of two percent on homestead
property until May 31 and four percent on June 1. The penalty on nonhomestead property is at a
rate of four percent until May 31 and eight percent on June 1. This penalty does not accrue until
June 1 of each year, or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property
tax statements, whichever is later, on commercial use real property used for seasonal residential
recreational purposes and classified as class 1c or 4c, and on other commercial use real property
classified as class 3a, provided that over 60 percent of the gross income earned by the enterprise on
the class 3a property is earned during the months of May, June, July, and August. In order for the first

half of the tax due on class 3a property to be paid after May 15 and before June 1, or 21 days after
the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is later, without
penalty, the owner of the property must attach an affidavit to the payment attesting to compliance
with the income provision of this subdivision. Thereafter, for both homestead and nonhomestead
property, on the first day of each month beginning July 1, up to and including October 1 following,
an additional penalty of one percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes
provided that if the due date was extended beyond May 15 as the result of any delay in mailing
property tax statements no additional penalty shall accrue if the tax is paid by the extended due
date. If the tax is not paid by the extended due date, then all penalties that would have accrued if the
due date had been May 15 shall be charged. When the taxes against any tract or lot exceed $  ­­5­
                                                                                                0 $250,
one-half thereof may be paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope
containing the property tax statement, whichever is later; and, if so paid, no penalty attaches; the
remaining one-half may be paid at any time prior to October 16 following, without penalty; but,
if not so paid, then a penalty of two percent accrues thereon for homestead property and a penalty
of four percent on nonhomestead property. Thereafter, for homestead property, on the first day of
November an additional penalty of four percent accrues and on the first day of December following,
an additional penalty of two percent accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. Thereafter,
for nonhomestead property, on the first day of November and December following, an additional
penalty of four percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. If one-half of
such taxes are not paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing
the property tax statement, whichever is later, the same may be paid at any time prior to October
16, with accrued penalties to the date of payment added, and thereupon no penalty attaches to the
remaining one-half until October 16 following.
    This section applies to payment of personal property taxes assessed against improvements to
leased property, except as provided by section 277.01, subdivision 3.
    A county may provide by resolution that in the case of a property owner that has multiple tracts
or parcels with aggregate taxes exceeding ­$5­0
                                              ­ $250, payments may be made in installments as
provided in this subdivision.
     The county treasurer may accept payments of more or less than the exact amount of a tax
installment due. Payments must be applied first to the oldest installment that is due but which
has not been fully paid. If the accepted payment is less than the amount due, payments must be
applied first to the penalty accrued for the year or the installment being paid. Acceptance of partial
payment of tax does not constitute a waiver of the minimum payment required as a condition for
filing an appeal under section 278.03 or any other law, nor does it affect the order of payment of
delinquent taxes under section 280.39.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 446A.086, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Tax levy for repayment. (a) With the approval of the authority, a governmental unit
may levy in the year the state makes a payment under this section an amount up to the amount
necessary to provide funds for the repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through
the date of estimated repayment by the governmental unit. The proceeds of this levy may be used
only for this purpose unless they exceed the amount actually due. Any excess must be used to repay
other state payments made under this section or must be deposited in the debt redemption fund of

the governmental unit. The amount of aids to be reduced to repay the state are decreased by the
amount levied.
    (b) If the state is not repaid in full for a payment made under this section by November 30
of the calendar year following the year in which the state makes the payment, the authority shall
require the governmental unit to certify a property tax levy in an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the governmental unit. To prevent undue hardship, the authority may allow
the governmental unit to certify the levy over a five-year period. The proceeds of the levy may be
used only for this purpose unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the
excess must be used to repay other state payments made under this section or must be deposited in
the debt redemption fund of the governmental unit. If the authority orders the governmental unit to
levy, the amount of aids reduced to repay the state are decreased by the amount levied.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 465.719, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Application of other laws. A corporation created by a political subdivision under this
section must comply with every law that applies to the political subdivision, as if the corporation
is a part of the political subdivision, unless the resolution ratifying creation of the corporation
specifically exempts the corporation from part or all of a law. If the resolution exempts the
corporation from part or all of a law, the resolution must make a detailed and specific finding as to
why the corporation cannot fulfill its purpose if the corporation is subject to that law. A corporation
may not be exempted from chapter 13D, the Minnesota Open Meeting Law, sections 138.163 to
138.25, governing records management, or chapter 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act. Any affected or interested person may bring an action in district court to void the resolution
on the grounds that the findings are not sufficiently detailed and specific, or that the corporation
can fulfill its purpose if it is subject to the law from which the resolution exempts the corporation.
Laws that apply to a political subdivision that also apply to a corporation created by a political
subdivision under this subdivision include, but are not limited to:
     (1) chapter 13D, the Minnesota Open Meeting Law;
     (2) chapter 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act;
     (3) section 471.345, the Uniform Municipal Contracting Law;
   (4) sections 43A.17, limiting the compensation of employees based on the governor's salary;
471.991 to 471.999, providing for equitable pay; and 465.72 and 465.722, governing severance
pay;

and affirmations, take depositions, and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and
the production of documents and other personal property considered necessary as evidence in
connection with the subject matter of an evidentiary hearing.
    The unemployment law judge must give full consideration to a request for a subpoena and
must not unreasonably deny a request for a subpoena. If a subpoena request is initially denied,
the unemployment law judge must, on the unemployment law judge's own motion, reconsider that
request during the evidentiary hearing and rule on whether the request was properly denied. If the

filing of plans, blueprints and specifications prior to commencement of installation. The installation
of water heaters shall not constitute water conditioning installation and consequently such work
shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of sections 326B.42 to 326B.49.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.58, is amended to read:
   326B.58 FEES.
    Examination fees for both water conditioning contractors and water conditioning installers shall
be $50 for each examination. Each water conditioning contractor and installer license shall expire on
December 31 of the year for which it was issued. The license fee for each initial water conditioning
contractor's license shall be $70, except that the license fee shall be $35 if the application is submitted
during the last three months of the calendar year. The license fee for each renewal water conditioning
contractor's license shall be $70. The license fee for each initial water conditioning installer license
shall be $35, except that the license fee shall be $17.50 if the application is submitted during the
last three months of the calendar year. The license fee for each renewal water conditioning installer
license shall be $35. The ­ co­m

                                            r Plumbing Board may by rule prescribe for the expiration
and renewal of licenses. Any licensee who does not renew a license within two years after the license
expires is no longer eligible for renewal. Such an individual must retake and pass the examination
before a new license will be issued. A water conditioning contractor or water conditioning installer
who submits a license renewal application after the time specified in rule but within two years after
the license expired must pay all past due renewal fees plus a late fee of $25."

a population of more than 5,000 according to the last federal census, the provisions of sections
326B.50 to 326B.58 that require licenses to engage in the work or business of water conditioning
installation, and the provisions that provide for the examination of applicants for such licenses,
do not apply to restricted master plumbers and restricted journeyman plumbers licensed under the
provisions of section 326B.475."

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Determination of value. ­   (­
                                          a­
                                           ) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3
shall upon timely application by the owner, in the manner provided in subdivision 8, be determined
solely with reference to its appropriate agricultural classification and value notwithstanding
sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any added
values resulting from nonagricultural factors. In order to account for the presence of nonagricultural
influences that may affect the value of agricultural land, the commissioner of revenue shall develop
a fair and uniform method of determining agricultural values for each county in the state that are
consistent with this subdivision. The commissioner shall annually assign the resulting values to
each county, and these values shall be used as the basis for determining the agricultural value for
all properties in the county qualifying for tax deferment under this section.

education and the local or regional governmental entity that owns a public library that has been
improved with state bond proceeds under this section determines that the library is no longer usable

of finance. Notwithstanding section 16A.695, subdivision 3, clause (2), the net proceeds must be
applied as follows: first, to pay the state the amount of state bond proceeds used to acquire or better
the property; and second, any remaining amount must be paid to the local or regional governmental
owner of the property sold. When the sale is complete and the sale proceeds have been applied as
provided in this subdivision, section 16A.695 no longer applies to the property and the property is
