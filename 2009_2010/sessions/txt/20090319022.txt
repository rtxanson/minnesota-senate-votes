subdivision 7a, the commissioner may deny conditional release to an offender under this section

public or an individual. In making this determination, the commissioner shall follow the procedures

subdivision. The commissioner shall consider whether the offender was involved in criminal gang
activity during the offender's prison term. The commissioner shall also consider the offender's
custody classification and level of risk of violence and the availability of appropriate community
supervision for the offender. Conditional release granted under this section continues until the
offender's sentence expires, unless release is rescinded under subdivision 8. The commissioner

employment, and securing housing.

funds to areas with high priority erosion, sedimentation, or water quality problems or water quantity
problems due to altered hydrology. The areas must be selected based on the statewide priorities
established by the state board. The allocated funds must be used for conservation practices for high
priority problems identified in the comprehensive and annual work plans of the districts.
   (b) The remaining cost-sharing funds may be allocated to districts as follows:
   (1) for technical and administrative assistance, not more than 20 percent of the funds; and
   (2) for conservation practices for lower priority erosion, sedimentation, or water quality
problems.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103C.501, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Contracts by districts. (a) A district board may contract on a cost-share basis to
furnish financial aid to a land occupier or to a state agency for permanent systems for erosion

consistent with the district's comprehensive and annual work plans.
    (b) The duration of the contract must, at a minimum, be the time required to complete the planned
systems. A contract must specify that the land occupier is liable for monetary damages and penalties
in an amount up to 150 percent of the financial assistance received from the district, for failure
to complete the systems or practices in a timely manner or maintain the systems or practices as
specified in the contract.
    (c) A contract may provide for cooperation or funding with federal agencies. A land occupier or
state agency may provide the cost-sharing portion of the contract through services in kind.
   (d) The state board or the district board may not furnish any financial aid for practices designed
only to increase land productivity.
    (e) When a district board determines that long-term maintenance of a system or practice is
desirable, the board may require that maintenance be made a covenant upon the land for the effective
life of the practice. A covenant under this subdivision shall be construed in the same manner as a
conservation restriction under section 84.65.

and commercial uses, and residential uses, where appropriate, within the Mississippi River corridor;
   (4) utilizes certain reaches of the river as a source of water supply and as a receiving water for
properly treated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste effluents; and
   (5) protects and preserves the biological and ecological functions of the corridor.
    (b) The Metropolitan Council shall incorporate the standards developed under this section into
its planning and shall work with local units of government and the commissioner to ensure the
standards are being adopted and implemented appropriately.
    Subd. 3. Districts. (a) The commissioner shall establish districts within the Mississippi River
corridor critical area. The commissioner must seek to minimize the number of districts within any
one municipality. The commissioner shall consider the following when establishing the districts:
   (1) the protection of resources that existed as of March 12, 1979;
   (2) the protection of improvements such as parks, trails, natural areas, and interpretive centers;
  (3) the protection of resources identified in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area
Comprehensive Management Plan;
   (4) the protection of resources identified in comprehensive plans developed by counties, cities,
and towns within the Mississippi River corridor critical area;
   (5) the intent of the Mississippi River corridor critical area land use districts from the governor's
executive order number 79-19, published in the State Register on March 12, 1979; and
   (6) identified scenic, geologic, and ecological resources.
    Subd. 4. Standards. (a) The commissioner shall establish minimum guidelines and standards
for the districts established in subdivision 3. The guidelines and standards for each district shall
include: the intent of each district; key resources and features to be protected or enhanced based
upon paragraph (b); permitted uses; and dimensional and performance standards for development.
The commissioner may provide certain exceptions and criteria for standards, including, but not
limited to, exceptions for river access facilities, water supply facilities, stormwater facilities, and
wastewater treatment facilities.
    (b) The guidelines and standards must protect or enhance the following key resources and
features:
   (1) floodplains;
   (2) wetlands;
   (3) gorges;
   (4) areas of confluence with key tributaries;
   (5) natural drainage routes;

   (8) steep slopes and very steep slopes;
   (9) unstable soils and bedrock;
   (10) significant existing vegetative stands, tree canopies, and native plant communities;
   (11) scenic views and vistas;
   (12) publicly owned parks, trails, and open spaces;
   (13) cultural and historic sites and structures; and
   (14) water quality.
   (c) The commissioner shall establish a map to define bluffs and bluff-related features within the
Mississippi River corridor critical area.
    At the outset of the rulemaking process, the commissioner shall create a preliminary map of all
the bluffs and bluff lines within the Mississippi River corridor critical area, based on the guidelines
in paragraph (d). The rulemaking process shall provide an opportunity to refine the preliminary bluff
map. The commissioner may add to or remove areas of demonstrably unique or atypical conditions
that warrant special protection or exemption. At the end of the rulemaking process, the commissioner
shall adopt a final bluff map that contains associated features, including bluff lines, bases of bluffs,
steep slopes, and very steep slopes.
  (d) The following guidelines shall be used by the commissioner to create a preliminary bluff
map as part of the rulemaking process:
   (1) "bluff face" or "bluff" means the area between the bluff line and the bluff base. A high, steep,
natural topographic feature such as a broad hill, cliff, or embankment with a slope of 18 percent or
greater and a vertical rise of at least ten feet between the bluff base and the bluff line;
    (2) "bluff line" means a line delineating the top of a slope connecting the points at which the slope
becomes less than 18 percent. More than one bluff line may be encountered proceeding upslope from
the river valley;
    (3) "base of the bluff" means a line delineating the bottom of a slope connecting the points
at which the slope becomes 18 percent or greater. More than one bluff base may be encountered
proceeding landward from the water;
    (4) "steep slopes" means 12 percent to 18 percent slopes. Steep slopes are natural topographic
features with an average slope of 12 to 18 percent measured over a horizontal distance of 50 feet or
more; and
    (5) "very steep slopes" means slopes 18 percent or greater. Very steep slopes are natural
topographic features with an average slope of 18 percent or greater, measured over a horizontal
distance of 50 feet or more.
   Subd. 5. Application. The standards established under this section shall be used:
   (1) by local units of government when preparing or updating plans or modifying regulations;
   (2) by state and regional agencies for permit regulation and in developing plans within their
830                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [22ND DAY

jurisdiction;
   (3) by the Metropolitan Council for reviewing plans, regulations, and development permit
applications; and
   (4) by the commissioner when approving plans, regulations, and development permit
applications.
    Subd. 6. Notification; fees. (a) A local unit of government or a regional or state agency shall
notify the commissioner of natural resources of all developments in the corridor that require
discretionary actions under their rules at least 10 days before taking final action on the application.
A local unit of government or agency failing to notify the commissioner at least 10 days before
taking final action shall submit a late fee of $500 to the commissioner. The commissioner may
establish exemptions from the notification requirement for certain types of applications within the
rules established under paragraph (b). For purposes of this section, a discretionary action includes
all actions that require a public hearing, including variances, conditional use permits, and zoning
amendments.
    (b) The commissioner shall establish by rule fees to be paid by local units of government and
agencies to the commissioner to recover costs of reviewing information submitted under paragraph
(a). The fees shall be based upon the cost of receiving and reviewing the information. The fees must
be set by rule. Section 16A.1283 does not apply to the fees, but the rule must not take effect until 45
days after the proposed rule has been submitted to the chairs and ranking minority members of the
legislative committees with jurisdiction over environment and local government policy and finance.
A local unit of government may pass on the costs of the fee to applicants.
    Subd. 7. Rules. The commissioner shall adopt rules to ensure compliance with this section. By
January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall begin the rulemaking required by this section. Until the
rules required under this section take effect, the commissioner shall administer the Mississippi River
corridor critical area program in accordance with the governor's executive order number 79-19,
published in the State Register on March 12, 1979."

      Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Budgets; form of notification. (a) Every board must publish revenue and
expenditure budgets for the current year and the actual revenues, expenditures, fund balances
for the prior year and projected fund balances for the current year in a form prescribed by the
commissioner within one week of the acceptance of the final audit by the board, or November 30,
whichever is earlier. The forms prescribed must be designed so that year to year comparisons of
revenue, expenditures and fund balances can be made.
    (b) A school board annually must notify the public of its revenue, expenditures, fund balances,
and other relevant budget information. The board must include the budget information required by
this section in the materials provided as a part of its truth in taxation hearing, post the materials in
a conspicuous place on the district's official Web site, including a link to the district's school report
card on the Department of Education's Web site, and publish a summary of the information in a
qualified newspaper of general circulation in the district.
22ND DAY]                                             THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 2009                                                                                841

      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
      (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
      (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
      (4) make reports required by the commissioner; and

     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.44, is amended to read:
     126C.44 SAFE SCHOOLS LEVY.
    (a) Each district may make a levy on all taxable property located within the district for the
purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for
a drug abuse prevention program as defined in section 609.101, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), in the
elementary schools; (3) to pay the costs for a gang resistance education training curriculum in the
district's schools; (4) to pay the costs for security in the district's schools and on school property;
(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.
       (c) A school district must set aside at least $3 per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit of the safe
