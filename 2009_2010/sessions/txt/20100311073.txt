    The Board of Trustees must develop and maintain a systemwide effective and efficient
mechanism for seamless student transfer between system institutions that has a goal of minimal
loss of credits for transferring students. The Degree Audit and Reporting System (DARS) and
u.select database (and successor databases) housed within the office of the chancellor shall be
the official repository of course equivalencies between system colleges and universities. Each
system college and university shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of
course equivalencies listed for courses offered by that college or university. The development and
maintenance of the system must, without limitation, address the following:
   (1) alignment of institution curriculum and its communication to stakeholders;
   (2) transfer between similar programs;
   (3) documentation for transfer-related agreements between institutions;
    (4) systemwide transfer information on the Internet that is easily accessible and maintained in a
current and accurate status. Each system college and university shall post course descriptions and
course outlines for all courses on their institutional Web sites. The links for current course outlines
and course descriptions shall be submitted to the office of the chancellor for publication on the
MinnesotaTransfer.org Web site;
   (5) training for campus-level staff to provide accurate and consistent advice to students;
   (6) institutional rather than student obligation to provide prompt required documentation for
course equivalency determinations; and
   (7) consistency of transfer policies among institutions in compliance with a system policy.

subdivisions 1 and 2;
    (8) evaluation of potential routes that would use or parallel existing railroad and highway
rights-of-way;
    (9) evaluation of governmental survey lines and other natural division lines of agricultural land
so as to minimize interference with agricultural operations;

general area as any proposed route, and the advisability of ordering the construction of structures
capable of expansion in transmission capacity through multiple circuiting or design modifications;
    (11) evaluation of irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources should the proposed
site or route be approved; and
    (12) when appropriate, consideration of problems raised by other state and federal agencies and
local entities.
    (c) If the commission's rules are substantially similar to existing regulations of a federal agency
to which the utility in the state is subject, the federal regulations must be applied by the commission.
   (d) No site or route shall be designated which violates state agency rules.
    (e) The commission must make specific findings that it has considered locating a route on
an existing high-voltage transmission route and the use of parallel existing railroad and highway
right-of-way and, to the extent those are not used for the route, the commission must state the
reasons."

written determination, which must include, to the extent possible, findings and recommendations on
the scope and amount of repairs necessary, if any. The qualified neutral shall mail the determination

dispute resolution process in lieu of participating in the home warranty dispute resolution process
established by this section. If the parties agree to an alternative dispute resolution process, they shall
provide written notice of the agreement and a description of the selected process to the commissioner
as soon as practicable, but no later than the date the parties are required to select a neutral under
subdivision 2.
   Subd. 5. Effect on future proceedings. (a) The written determination issued by the qualified
neutral and all communications relating to the home warranty dispute resolution process,
except those between the parties and the commissioner, are deemed confidential settlement
communications pursuant to Rule 408 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (b) No party may use an offer of repair provided by a vendor or home improvement contractor or
a written determination issued by the qualified neutral as evidence of liability in subsequent litigation
between the parties. The qualified neutral may not be called to testify regarding the dispute resolution
proceedings.
    (c) Any amount paid by a party for the services of a qualified neutral under this section is deemed
a taxable cost of the prevailing party in a subsequent litigation involving the same subject matter.

    Subd. 2a. Content of notice of redemption rights. The notice of redemption rights required by
this section must appear substantially as follows:
   "What Happens After the Foreclosure Sale
After the sheriff's sale, you have the right to "redeem." Redeem means that you pay the amount bid
for your house at the sheriff's sale plus fees to keep your house. You can keep living in your home
for a period of time after the foreclosure sale. This is called a "redemption period." The redemption
period is [insert number of months] months after the sheriff's sale. (The redemption period may be
shortened if you have postponed the foreclosure or if the property is declared to be abandoned.)
    At the end of the redemption period, if you do not redeem or sell, you will have to leave your
home. If you do not leave, the person or company that bid on your home at the sheriff's sale has the
right to file an eviction against you in district court.
   Be Careful of Foreclosure Scams
   Be careful! After the foreclosure sale, people may approach you to buy your house or offer to
deed your house to them for little or no money.
    Before you give up the rights to your house or sign any documents (including a deed), be sure
you know how much the house sold for at the sheriff's sale and decide if you can save it by buying
it back from the winning bidder.
   How to Find Out How Much Your House Sold For at the Foreclosure Sale
    The amount you need to pay to keep your house ("redeem") may be less than the amount you
owed on your mortgage before the sale (although it could also be more). You can learn what this
amount is (and who the winning bidder at the sale was) by attending the sheriff's sale or by calling
the sheriff's office after the sale.
   You Can Also Sell Your House
     During the redemption period, if you sell your home, you must sell it for enough to pay off
the winning bidder from the sheriff's sale AND pay any recorded liens, fines, or fees that have
accumulated. (A lien is a legal claim that someone has put on your property because you owe that
person money. A recorded lien means that it has been filed with the county as a public document.)
If there is any money left from the sale of the house after all these debts are paid, you can keep it.

knowledge of the facts, stating that the notice required by this section has been delivered in
compliance with this section or that this section is not applicable because the property described
in the notice of foreclosure did not consist of one to four family dwelling units, one of which was
occupied by the owner as the owner's principal place of residency. The affidavit and a certified copy
of a recorded affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. The affidavit
may be recorded regarding any foreclosure sale, including foreclosure sales which occurred prior
to August 1, 2005, and may be recorded separately or as part of the record of a foreclosure.
    Subd. 4. Validation of foreclosure sales. No mortgage foreclosure sale under this chapter shall
be invalid because of failure to comply with this section unless an action to invalidate the sale is
commenced and a notice of lis pendens is filed with the county recorder or registrar of titles within
one year after the last day of the redemption period of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal
representatives, or assigns. This subdivision shall not affect any action or proceeding pending on
August 1, 2005, or which is commenced before February 1, 2006, in any court of this state, provided
a notice of lis pendens of the action is filed with the county recorder or registrar of titles before
February 1, 2006.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 580.06, is amended to read:
   580.06 SALE, HOW AND BY WHOM MADE; NOTICE TO MORTGAGOR.
    Subdivision 1. Requirements for sale. The sale shall be made by the sheriff or the sheriff's
deputy at public venue to the highest bidder, in the county in which the premises to be sold, or some
part thereof, are situated, between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
    Subd. 2. Notice of results of sale required; contents. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c),
a person attempting to acquire title to the mortgagor's property following the sheriff's sale and prior
to the end of the redemption period, must provide to the mortgagor, by personal delivery three days
prior to entering into an agreement to acquire title, notice of the results of the foreclosure as provided
under paragraph (b).
   (b) The notice required under paragraph (a) must contain the following information:
   (1) the date the sale occurred;
   (2) the identity of the purchaser and any assignees of the purchaser;
   (3) the sale price; and
   (4) the following statement: "There are very important things you need to know now that your
house has been auctioned at the sheriff's sale:
    (i) you have (insert the number of months) to "redeem," which means to pay the winning bidder
the sale price listed above (plus interest and costs) and keep your house;
   (ii) the redemption period may be shortened if you have postponed the foreclosure or if the
property is declared to be abandoned;
  (iii) whether you can pay off the amount or not, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MOVE RIGHT
AWAY. YOU CAN KEEP LIVING IN YOUR HOME until the end of this redemption period;
   (iv) read all notices and documents related to the foreclosure of your home carefully!!

THE AMOUNT YOU NEED TO PAY THE WINNING BIDDER TO KEEP YOUR HOUSE
(THE PRICE LISTED ABOVE PLUS INTEREST AND COSTS) MAY BE LESS THAN THE
AMOUNT YOU OWED ON YOUR MORTGAGE BEFORE THE SALE; and
    (v) you can also try to sell your home during this "redemption period." You must sell it for
enough to pay off the winning bidder from the sheriff's sale and pay any recorded liens, fines, or
fees that have built up. A lien is a legal claim that someone has put on your property because you
owe them money. A recorded lien means that it has been filed with the county as a public document.
For example, if you owe on a second mortgage or to a contractor, there could be a recorded lien
against the property.
      If there is any money left from the sale of the house after all these debts are paid, you can keep
it.

counselor. You can find a mortgage foreclosure prevention counselor in your county by calling the
Minnesota Home Ownership Center at 651-659-9336 or 866-462-6466 or www.hocmn.org."
      (c) This subdivision does not apply to:
    (1) a seller or buyer who has entered into a signed agency agreement, facilitator agreement, or
other written agreement to buy or sell the mortgagor's property with a person licensed under chapter
82;
    (2) a buyer who offers to buy the mortgagor's property for a purchase price that meets or exceeds
the amount required to be paid by the mortgagor to redeem the property;
      (3) a foreclosing lender acquiring the mortgagor's property by a deed in lieu of foreclosure;
      (4) a nonprofit lender holding a certificate of exemption from the Department of Commerce; or
      (5) the state or a local unit of government or an agent of the state or a local unit of government.
   Subd. 3. Private right of action. (a) Any person who violates subdivision 2 is liable to the
mortgagor for the sum of:
      (1) actual, incidental, and consequential damages;
      (2) $1,000 statutory damages; and
      (3) costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorney fees.
    (b) It shall be a rebuttable presumption that a person has complied with subdivision 2 if the
person has recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles an affidavit by a person having
knowledge of the facts, stating that the mortgagor received the notice required under subdivision 2.
The affidavit and a certified copy of a recorded affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
stated in the affidavit.

The summons in a conciliation court action under subdivisions 6 to 10 may be served anywhere
in the state, and the summons in a conciliation court action under subdivision 7, paragraph (b),
may be served outside the state in the manner provided by law. The court administrator shall serve
the summons in a conciliation court action by first class mail, except that if the amount of money
or property that is the subject of the claim exceeds $2,500, the summons must be served by the
plaintiff by certified mail, and service on nonresident defendants must be made in accordance with
applicable law or rule. Subpoenas to secure the attendance of nonparty witnesses and the production
of documents at trial may be served anywhere within the state in the manner provided by law.
   When a court administrator is required to summon the defendant by certified mail under this
paragraph, the summons may be made by personal service in the manner provided in the Rules of
Civil Procedure for personal service of a summons of the district court as an alternative to service
by certified mail.

under sections 609.531 to 609.5318 is not subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody
of the appropriate agency subject to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over
the forfeiture proceedings. When property is so seized, the appropriate agency shall use reasonable
diligence to secure the property and prevent waste and may do any of the following:
   (1) place the property under seal;
   (2) remove the property to a place designated by it; and
    (3) in the case of controlled substances, require the state Board of Pharmacy to take custody of
the property and remove it to an appropriate location for disposition in accordance with law;­­­

bond payable to the appropriate agency in an amount equal to the retail value of the seized property.
On posting the security or bond, the seized property must be returned to the owner and the forfeiture
action shall proceed against the security as if it were the seized property. This subdivision does not
apply to contraband property.
     (b) If the owner of a motor vehicle that has been seized under this section seeks possession of the
vehicle before the forfeiture action is determined, the owner may surrender the vehicle's certificate
of title in exchange for the vehicle. The motor vehicle must be returned to the owner within 24 hours
if the owner surrenders the motor vehicle's certificate of title to the appropriate agency, pending
resolution of the forfeiture action. If the certificate is surrendered, the owner may not be ordered to
post security or bond as a condition of release of the vehicle. When a certificate of title is surrendered
under this provision, the agency shall notify the Department of Public Safety and any secured party
noted on the certificate. The agency shall also notify the department and the secured party when it
returns a surrendered title to the motor vehicle owner.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.531, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Release of property before final determination. Any person with an interest in
property that has been seized for forfeiture under this section may file an application to have an
order to show cause issued to the prosecuting agency to determine if probable cause existed to
seize the property for forfeiture.
    When a hearing is held on the show cause order, the court shall determine if probable cause
to seize the property for forfeiture existed. If the court finds that probable cause for seizure of the
property for forfeiture did not exist, the appropriate agency shall release the property.

claiming a security interest bears the burden of establishing that interest by clear and convincing
evidence.
    (f) Forfeiture under this section of real property is subject to the interests of a good faith purchaser
for value unless the purchaser had knowledge of or consented to the act or omission upon which the
forfeiture is based.
     (g) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), property is not subject to forfeiture based solely
on the owner's or secured party's knowledge of the unlawful use or intended use of the property
if: (1) the owner or secured party took reasonable steps to terminate use of the property by the
offender; or (2) the property is real property owned by the parent of the offender, unless the parent
actively participated in, or knowingly acquiesced to, a violation of chapter 152, or the real property
constitutes proceeds derived from or traceable to a use described in subdivision 2.

device or real property, for the purposes of forfeiture under paragraphs (a) to (g).
   (i) Property is not subject to forfeiture under this section if the forfeiture would create an undue
hardship for members of the owner's immediate family.

    (b) A motion to expunge under this subdivision is available only for the related eviction case
that is pending.
   (c) An expungement motion may be granted only if the tenant prevailed in the eviction case.
Prevailing in the eviction case does not include a tenant's redeeming the tenancy by paying the
amount due the landlord, or a settlement between the landlord and tenant.
   (d) The landlord, the landlord's agent, and witnesses shall have the right to speak and offer
evidence in opposition to or in support of the motion, and an agreement to the contrary is null and
void.
    (e) The court's ruling on the expungement motion must include written findings specifying the
statutory requirements for expungement that were met, if the motion is granted, or the statutory
requirements for expungement that were not met, if the motion is denied.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.111, is amended to read:
    504B.111 WRITTEN LEASE REQUIRED; PENALTY.
    (a) A landlord of a residential building with 12 or more residential units must have a written lease
for each unit rented to a residential tenant. Notwithstanding any other state law or city ordinance
to the contrary, a landlord may ask for the tenant's full name and date of birth on the lease and
application. A landlord who fails to provide a lease, as required under this section, is guilty of a
petty misdemeanor.
     (b) A landlord of a residential building may not charge a late fee if the rent is paid after the date
it is due, unless the tenant and landlord have agreed in writing that a fee may be imposed. In no case
may the late fee exceed a certain percentage of the rent payment. Any late fee charged or collected
must not be considered either interest or liquidated damages. For purposes of this paragraph, the
"due date" does not include a date earlier than the date contained in the written or oral agreement to
lease by which, if the rent is paid, the tenant earns a discount.
    Sec. 4. [504B.118] RECEIPT FOR RENT PAID IN CASH.
    A landlord receiving rent or other payments from a tenant in cash must provide a written receipt
for payment immediately upon receipt if the payment is made in person, or within three business
days if payment in cash is not made in person.
  Sec. 5. [504B.172] RECOVERY OF COSTS IN ACTION FOR BREACH OF
COVENANTS.
    When a residential lease specifies circumstances that entitle a landlord, directly or through
additional rent, to recover attorney fees and expenses in an action, it is implied in law that a tenant
is entitled to attorney fees and costs in an action initiated by the tenant, or in a successful defense
of an action commenced by the landlord against the tenant, involving the same circumstances.

    (1) charge an applicant a screening fee when the landlord knows or should have known that no
rental unit is available at that time or will be available within a reasonable future time;
    (2) collect or hold an applicant screening fee without giving the applicant a written receipt for
the fee, which may be incorporated into the application form, upon request of the applicant; or
    (3) use, cash, or deposit an applicant screening fee until all prior applicants have either been
screened and rejected, or offered the unit and declined to enter into a rental agreement.
For purposes of this section, "landlord" means any person having the right to rent or lease any real
property and that person's agent.

     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.178, subdivision 7, is amended to read:

     Subd. 7. Bad faith retention. The bad faith retention by a landlord of a deposit, the interest
thereon, or any portion thereof, in violation of this section shall subject the landlord to punitive
damages not to exceed ­  $2­0
                            ­0­ $500 for each deposit in addition to the damages provided in subdivision
4. If the landlord has failed to comply with the provisions of subdivision 3 or 5, retention of a deposit
shall be presumed to be in bad faith unless the landlord returns the deposit within two weeks after
the commencement of any action for the recovery of the deposit.
      Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.215, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Single-meter utility service payments. Except as provided in subdivision 3, the
landlord of a single-metered residential building shall be the bill payer responsible, and shall be
the customer of record contracting with the utility for utility services. The landlord must advise the
utility provider that the utility services apply to a single-metered residential building. A failure by
the landlord to comply with this subdivision or subdivision 2a is a violation of sections 504B.161,
subdivision 1, clause (1), and 504B.221. This subdivision may not be waived by contract or
otherwise. This subdivision does not require a landlord to contract and pay for utility service
provided to each residential unit through a separate meter which accurately measures that unit's
use only. This subdivision does not prohibit a landlord from apportioning utility service payments
among residential units and either including utility costs in a unit's rent or billing for utility charges
separate from rent.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 504B.285, subdivision 1, is amended to

   (3) any tenant at will holds over after the termination of the tenancy by notice to quit.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.285, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Grounds when the person holding over is a tenant in a foreclosed property. (a)
For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, where the person holding the
real property after the expiration of the time for redemption on foreclosure of a mortgage was a
tenant during the redemption period under a lease of any duration, and the lease began after the date
the mortgage was executed, but prior to the expiration of the time for redemption, the successor in
interest must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no sooner than the date of the
expiration of the time for redemption or termination, and effective no sooner than 90 days after the
date of the expiration of the time for redemption, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides
by all terms of the lease.
    (b) For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, where the term of
a bona fide lease extends more than 90 days beyond the date of the expiration of the time for
redemption, the immediate successor in interest must allow the tenant to occupy the premises until
the end of the remaining term of the lease, and provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate,
effective no sooner than the date the lease expires, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides
by all terms of the lease, except if the immediate successor in interest or an immediate subsequent
bona fide purchaser will occupy the unit as the primary residence, the immediate successor in interest
must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no earlier than the date of the expiration
of the time for redemption, effective no sooner than 90 days after the date of the expiration of the
time for redemption, provided the tenant pays the rent and abides by all terms of the lease.
   For purposes of this section, a "bona fide lease" means:
   (1) the mortgagor or the child, spouse, or parent of the mortgagor is not the tenant;
   (2) the lease or tenancy was the result of an arm's-length transaction; and
    (3) the lease or tenancy requires the receipt of rent that is not substantially less than fair market
rent for the property.
    (c) For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, in the case of a tenancy
subject to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, where the term of the
lease extends more than 90 days beyond the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, the
immediate successor in interest must allow the tenant to occupy the premises until the end of the
remaining term of the lease and provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, effective no sooner
than the date the lease expires, provided the tenant pays the rent and abides by all terms of the
lease, except if the immediate successor in interest will occupy the unit as the primary residence,
the immediate successor must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no earlier
than the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, effective no sooner than 90 days after the
date of the expiration of the time for redemption, provided the tenant pays the rent and abides by all
terms of the lease.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.285, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Grounds when the person holding over is a tenant in a foreclosed property subject
to a contract for deed. For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, where
the person holding the real property after the expiration of the time for termination of a contract to

convey the property was a tenant during the termination period under a lease of any duration, and
the lease began after the contract for deed was executed, but prior to the expiration of the time for
termination, the successor in interest must provide at least 60 days' written notice to vacate, given
no sooner than the date of the expiration of the time for termination and effective no sooner than 60
days after the date of the expiration of the time for termination, provided that the tenant pays the
rent and abides by all terms of the lease.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.285, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 1c. Grounds for evictions on or after January 1, 2013. For any eviction action
commenced on or after January 1, 2013, the person entitled to the premises may recover possession
by eviction when any person holds over real property after the expiration of the time for redemption
on foreclosure of a mortgage, or after termination of contract to convey the property, provided that
if the person holding the real property after the expiration of the time for redemption or termination
was a tenant during the redemption or termination period under a lease of any duration, and the
lease began after the date the mortgage or contract for deed was executed, but prior to the expiration
of the time for redemption or termination, the person holding the premises has received:
    (1) at least two months' written notice to vacate no sooner than one month after the expiration
of the time for redemption or termination, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides by all
terms of the lease; or
    (2) at least two months' written notice to vacate no later than the date of the expiration of the
time for redemption or termination, which notice shall also state that the sender will hold the tenant
harmless for breaching the lease by vacating the premises if the mortgage is redeemed or the contract
is reinstated.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.291, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Action to recover. (a) A landlord may bring an eviction action for nonpayment
of rent irrespective of whether the lease contains a right of reentry clause. Such an eviction action
is equivalent to a demand for the rent. There is a rebuttable presumption that the rent has been paid
if the tenant produces receipts or equivalent documents evidencing purchase of one or more money
orders, bank checks, or cashier's checks, or a combination of money orders, bank checks, or cashier's
checks totaling the amount of the rent, with a date or dates approximately corresponding with the
date the rent was due. In such an action, unless the landlord has also sought to evict the tenant by
alleging a material violation of the lease under section 504B.285, subdivision 5, the tenant may, at
any time before possession has been delivered, redeem the tenancy and be restored to possession
by paying to the landlord or bringing to court the amount of the rent that is in arrears, with interest,
costs of the action, and an attorney's fee not to exceed $5, and by performing any other covenants
of the lease.
    (b) If the tenant has paid to the landlord or brought into court the amount of rent in arrears but
is unable to pay the interest, costs of the action, and attorney's fees required by paragraph (a), the
court may permit the tenant to pay these amounts into court and be restored to possession within
the same period of time, if any, for which the court stays the issuance of the order to vacate under
section 504B.345.
    (c) Prior to or after commencement of an action to recover possession for nonpayment of rent,
the parties may agree only in writing that partial payment of rent in arrears which is accepted by

the landlord prior to issuance of the order granting restitution of the premises pursuant to section
504B.345 may be applied to the balance due and does not waive the landlord's action to recover
possession of the premises for nonpayment of rent.
    (d) Rental payments under this subdivision must first be applied to rent claimed as due in
the complaint from prior rental periods before applying any payment toward rent claimed in the
complaint for the current rental period, unless the court finds that under the circumstances the
claim for rent from prior rental periods has been waived."

data classification systems, as well as federal or state requirements for collection of certain data
based on predetermined classification systems that may impact some data collection efforts.

    (c) A general burning permit may be adopted by the county board of commissioners in counties
that are determined by the commissioner either to not be wildfire areas as defined in section 88.01,
subdivision 6, or to otherwise have low potential for damage to life and property from wildfire.
The commissioner shall consider the history of and potential for wildfire; the distribution of trees,
brush, grasslands, and other vegetative material; and the distribution of property subject to damage
from escaped fires. Upon a determination by the commissioner and adoption by a vote of the county
board, permission for open burning is extended to all residents in the county without the need for

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.041, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Reoffering unsold timber. To maintain and enhance forest ecosystems on state forest
lands, the commissioner may reoffer timber tracts remaining unsold under the provisions of section
90.101 below appraised value at public auction with the required 30-day notice under section 90.101,
subdivision 2.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.121, is amended to read:
    90.121 INTERMEDIATE AUCTION SALES; MAXIMUM LOTS OF 3,000 CORDS.
    (a) The commissioner may sell the timber on any tract of state land in lots not exceeding 3,000
cords in volume, in the same manner as timber sold at public auction under section 90.101, and
related laws, subject to the following special exceptions and limitations:
    (1) the commissioner shall offer all tracts authorized for sale by this section separately from the
sale of tracts of state timber made pursuant to section 90.101;
    (2) no bidder may be awarded more than 25 percent of the total tracts offered at the first round
of bidding unless fewer than four tracts are offered, in which case not more than one tract shall
be awarded to one bidder. Any tract not sold at public auction may be offered for private sale as
authorized by section 90.101, subdivision 1, to persons eligible under this section at the appraised
value; and
    (3) no sale may be made to a person having more than 2  ­0
                                                             ­ 30 employees. For the purposes of
this clause, "employee" means an individual working for salary or wages on a full-time or part-time
basis.
    (b) The auction sale procedure set forth in this section constitutes an additional alternative timber
sale procedure available to the commissioner and is not intended to replace other authority possessed
by the commissioner to sell timber in lots of 3,000 cords or less.
    (c) Another bidder or the commissioner may request that the number of employees a bidder
has pursuant to paragraph (a), clause (3), be confirmed if there is evidence that the bidder may be
ineligible due to exceeding the employee threshold. The commissioner shall request information
from the commissioner of labor and industry including the premiums paid by the bidder in question
for workers' compensation insurance coverage for all employees of the bidder. The commissioner
shall review the information submitted by the commissioner of labor and industry and make a
determination based on the information as to whether the bidder is eligible.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.14, is amended to read:
    90.14 AUCTION SALE PROCEDURE.
    (a) All state timber shall be offered and sold by the same unit of measurement as it was appraised.

No tract shall be sold to any person other than the purchaser in whose name the bid was made. The
commissioner may refuse to approve any and all bids received and cancel a sale of state timber for
good and sufficient reasons.
    (b) The purchaser at any sale of timber shall, immediately upon the approval of the bid, or,
if unsold at public auction, at the time of purchase at a subsequent sale under section 90.101,
subdivision 1, pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the appraised value. In
case any purchaser fails to make such payment, the purchaser shall be liable therefor to the state in
a civil action, and the commissioner may reoffer the timber for sale as though no bid or sale under
section 90.101, subdivision 1, therefor had been made.
    (c) In lieu of the scaling of state timber required by this chapter, a purchaser of state timber may,
at the time of payment by the purchaser to the commissioner of 15 percent of the appraised value,
elect in writing on a form prescribed by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the
appraiser's estimate of the volume of timber described in the permit, provided that the commissioner
has expressly designated the availability of such option for that tract on the list of tracts available
for sale as required under section 90.101. A purchaser who elects in writing on a form prescribed
by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the appraiser's estimate of the volume
of timber described on the permit does not have recourse to the provisions of section 90.281.
    (d) In the case of a public auction sale conducted by a sealed bid process, tracts shall be
awarded to the high bidder, who shall pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the
appraised value w­­t

   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans that are offered by a demonstration provider
or by an entity that is directly or indirectly wholly owned or controlled by a demonstration provider
to provide Medicaid services. Medicare funds and services shall be administered according to
the terms and conditions of the federal contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose
of administering medical assistance funds, demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to
subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to
these demonstrations, with the exceptions of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457,
subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this
section. All enforcement and rulemaking powers available under chapters 62D, 62M, and 62Q are
hereby granted to the commissioner of health with respect to Medicare-approved special needs
plans with which the commissioner contracts to provide Medicaid services under this section.
An initial open enrollment period may be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations
under this subdivision remain subject to Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a
person is enrolled in a health plan under these demonstrations and the health plan's participation
is subsequently terminated for any reason, the person shall be provided an opportunity to select
a new health plan and shall have the right to change health plans within the first 60 days of
enrollment in the second health plan. Persons required to participate in health plans under this
section who fail to make a choice of health plan shall not be randomly assigned to health plans
under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section 256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota
Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the purpose of demonstrations under this
7548                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [73RD DAY

subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed care organizations, including counties,
to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance, elderly and disabled persons, or
disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of developmental disability, serious
and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance, the commissioner must ensure that
the county authority has approved the demonstration and contracting design. Enrollment in these
projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The commissioner shall not implement any
demonstration project under this subdivision for persons with a primary diagnosis of developmental
disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance, without
approval of the county board of the county in which the demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of

waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods for contract
years starting in 2012, the commissioner must consider the methods used to determine county
allocations for home and community-based program participants. If necessary to reduce MnDHO
rates to comply with the provision regarding MnDHO costs for home and community-based
services, the commissioner shall achieve the reduction by maintaining the base rate for contract
years 2010 and 2011 for services provided under the community alternatives for disabled
individuals waiver at the same level as for contract year 2009. The commissioner may apply other
reductions to MnDHO rates to implement decreases in provider payment rates required by state
law. In developing program specifications for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner
shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph
(d), including consultation on whether and how to include home and community-based waiver
programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the
house of representatives and senate committees with jurisdiction over health and human services
policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government."

256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that

were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section and county-based purchasing plan's
payment rate under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance and general assistance
medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be
quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance
target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must
be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, including characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July of the
following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The commissioner may exclude
special demonstration projects under subdivision 23.
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, the
commissioner shall withhold three percent of managed care plan payments under this section and
county-based purchasing plan payments under section 256B.692 for the prepaid medical assistance
and general assistance medical care programs. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than
July 1 and no later than July 31 of the following year. The commissioner may exclude special
demonstration projects under subdivision 23.

those in effect on July 1, 2009.
    (c) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general

paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (h) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (d) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d), (f), and (g).
    (i) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The applicant
must complete the application within the time periods required under the medical assistance
program as specified in Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0015, subpart 5, and 9505.0090, subpart 2.
The county agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (j) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (k) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (l) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    (m) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
73RD DAY]                        THURSDAY, MARCH 11, 2010                                            7555

the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (n) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
    (o) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the
classes listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101, subsection (a), paragraph (15), and an
undocumented noncitizen is an individual who resides in the United States without the approval or
acquiescence of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.
    (p) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (q) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.04, subdivision 7b, is amended to read:

care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies,
and services. For purposes of this section, prosthesis includes any repair or replacement of the
device and may be furnished only by an accredited facility in comprehensive prosthetic services, or

fabricating, assembling, fitting, aligning, adjusting, or servicing, as well as providing the initial
training necessary to accomplish the fitting of, a prosthesis through the replacement of external
parts of a human body lost due to amputation or congenital deformities or absences. The practice
of prosthetics also includes the generation of an image, form, or mold that replicates the patient's
body segment and that requires rectification of dimensions, contours, and volumes for use in
the design and fabrication of a socket to accept a residual anatomic limb to, in turn, create an
artificial appendage that is designed either to support body weight or to improve or restore function
or anatomical appearance, or both. Involved in the practice of prosthetics is observational gait
analysis and clinical assessment of the requirements necessary to refine and mechanically fix the
relative position of various parts of the prosthesis to maximize function, stability, and safety of
the patient. The practice of prosthetics includes providing and continuing patient care in order to

assess the prosthetic device's effect on the patient's tissues and to assure proper fit and function of
the prosthetic device by periodic evaluation.
   (c) "Orthosis" means:
    (1) an external medical device that is custom-fabricated or custom-fitted to a specific patient
based on the patient's unique physical condition and is applied to a part of the body to correct a
deformity, provide support and protection, restrict motion, improve function, or relieve symptoms
of a disease, syndrome, injury, or postoperative condition and is deemed medically necessary by a
prescribing physician or licensed health care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe
orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services; and
   (2) any repair or replacement of the device that is furnished by an accredited facility in
comprehensive orthotic services, or by a credentialed clinician who is certified or licensed.
   (d) "Orthotics" means:
    (1) the science and practice of evaluating, measuring, designing, fabricating, assembling, fitting,
adjusting, or servicing and providing the initial training necessary to accomplish the fitting of an
orthotic device for the support, correction, or alleviation of a neuromuscular or musculoskeletal
dysfunction, disease, injury, or deformity;
   (2) evaluation, treatment, and consultation;
   (3) basic observation of gait and postural analysis;
   (4) assessing and designing orthosis to maximize function and provide support and alignment
necessary to prevent or correct a deformity or to improve the safety and efficiency of mobility and
locomotion;
   (5) continuing patient care to assess the effect on the patient's tissues; and
   (6) proper fit and function of the orthotic device by periodic evaluation.
    (e) "Accredited facility" means any entity that is accredited by the American Board for
Certification in Orthotics Prosthetics and Pedorthics (ABC), by the Board for Orthotist/Prosthetist
Certification (BOC), by the Joint Commission (JC), or by the Commission on Accreditation of
Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and that provides comprehensive orthotic and prosthetic devices
or services.
     Subd. 2. Coverage. (a) A health plan shall provide coverage for orthotic and prosthetic devices,
supplies, and services to the extent that coverage is provided under federal laws for health insurance
for the aged and disabled under sections 1832, 1833, 1834, Social Security Act (United States Code,
title 42, sections 1395k, 1395l, and 1395m), but only to the extent consistent with this section.
Coverage may be limited to the orthotic or prosthetic devices, supplies, and services that are the most
appropriate model that is determined medically necessary by the prescribing physician or licensed
health care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe orthotic and prosthetic devices,
supplies, and services, and includes the design, fabrication, material and component selection, and
measurements, fittings, static and dynamic alignments and device maintenance, including repair
of the device to restore or maintain the ability to complete activities of daily living and essential
job-related activities and that is not solely for comfort, convenience, or recreation.

replacement of an orthotic or prosthetic device that is medically necessary by a prescribing
physician or licensed health care provider who has the authority in this state to prescribe orthotic

also include information on agencies' compliance with the commissioner's policies governing the
use of general obligation bond proceeds to pay staff costs and any changes to the commissioner's
policies.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 16A.647, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority to issue. When authorized by law to issue state general obligation
bonds or state 911 revenue bonds under section 403.275, the commissioner may issue all or part of
the bonds as tax credit bonds or as interest subsidy bonds or a combination of the two.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 16A.647, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Sale; certain costs of issuance. Tax credit bonds and interest subsidy bonds must be
sold at a price not less than 98 percent of their stated principal amount. No state trunk highway bond
may be sold for a price of less than par and accrued interest. When the commissioner determines to
issue tax credit bonds or interest subsidy bonds to achieve a net present value debt service savings
over tax-exempt bonds, the commissioner may issue an additional principal amount of bonds, not
to exceed two percent of the principal amount of bonds otherwise authorized by law to be issued,
to pay the costs of investment banking and banking services related to the sale or placement of the
bonds, provided the additional issuance will not cause an increase in the general fund debt service
transfer for the biennium during which the bonds are sold, as estimated by the commissioner. The
proceeds are appropriated for this purpose.

secured in the same way as the refunded bonds. The proceeds of refunding bonds may be deposited,
invested, and applied to accomplish the refunding as provided in section 475.67, subdivisions 5
to 10, and 13. Bids for the securities to be purchased for the escrow account may be secured, at
the commissioner's election, either through the State Board of Investment or a suitable financial
institution. The interest rate on refunding bonds may exceed that on the refunded bonds if the
purpose of refunding is to extend the maturities and to reduce the amount needed annually to pay
and to secure the debt.

    (b) Notice of revocation. An easement or permit is revocable by written notice given by the
commissioner if at any time its continuance will conflict with a public use of the land over, under,
or upon which it is granted, or for any other reason. The notice must be in writing and is effective
90 days after the notice is sent by certified mail to the last known address of the record holder of
the easement. If the address of the holder of the easement or permit is not known, it expires 90 days
after the notice is recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the land is
located. Upon revocation of an easement, the commissioner may allow a reasonable time for the
easement holder to vacate the premises affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the commissioner
may grant to a state agency or political subdivision a permanent easement for the construction,
operation, and maintenance of publicly owned infrastructure as described in paragraph (a), to have
and to hold for as long as the easement area is used in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the easement. If a permanent easement ceases to be used for the purposes stated in the easement or
in accordance with its terms and conditions, the easement may be revoked by a written notice given
by the commissioner in accordance with this paragraph.
   (c) Easement runs with land. State land subject to an easement or permit granted by the
commissioner remains subject to sale or lease, and the sale or lease does not revoke the permit or
easement granted.
    Subd. 2. Land controlled by other agencies. If the easement or permit involves land under the
jurisdiction of an agency other than the Department of Administration, it is subject to the approval of
the head of the agency and is subject to revocation by the commissioner as provided in this section,
on request of the head of the agency.

    Subd. 3. Grant program established. (a) The commissioner shall make competitive grants to
local governmental units to acquire and prepare land on which public infrastructure required to
support an eligible project will be located, including demolition of structures and remediation of
any hazardous conditions on the land, or to predesign, design, acquire, construct, furnish, and equip
public infrastructure required to support an eligible project. The local governmental unit receiving
a grant must provide for the remainder of the public infrastructure costs from other sources. The
commissioner may waive the requirements related to an eligible project under subdivision 2 if a
project would be eligible under this section but for the fact that its location requires infrastructure
improvements to residential development.
   (b) The amount of a grant may not exceed the lesser of the cost of the public infrastructure or
50 percent of the sum of the cost of the public infrastructure plus the cost of the completed eligible
project.
    (c) The purpose of the program is to keep or enhance jobs in the area, increase the tax base, or
to expand or create new economic development through the growth of new ­     b­o

businesses and organizations.
   Subd. 4. Application. (a) The commissioner must develop forms and procedures for soliciting
and reviewing applications for grants under this section. At a minimum, a local governmental unit
must include the following information in its application:
    (1) a resolution of its governing body certifying that the money required to be supplied by the
local governmental unit to complete the public infrastructure is available and committed;
    (2) a detailed estimate, along with necessary supporting evidence, of the total development costs
for the public infrastructure and eligible project;
    (3) an assessment of the potential or likely use of the site for ­b­o
                                                                        i­­c­e

activities after completion of the public infrastructure and eligible project;
   (4) a timeline indicating the major milestones of the public infrastructure and eligible project
and their anticipated completion dates;

    (5) a commitment from the governing body to repay the grant if the milestones are not realized
by the completion date identified in clause (4); and
     (6) any additional information or material the commissioner prescribes.
    (b) The determination of whether to make a grant under subdivision 3 is within the discretion
of the commissioner, subject to this section. The commissioner's decisions and application of the
priorities are not subject to judicial review, except for abuse of discretion.
    Subd. 5. Priorities. (a) If applications for grants exceed the available appropriations, grants
must be made for public infrastructure that, in the commissioner's judgment, provides the highest
return in public benefits for the public costs incurred. "Public benefits" include job creation,
environmental benefits to the state and region, efficient use of public transportation, efficient use
of existing infrastructure, provision of affordable housing, multiuse development that constitutes
community rebuilding rather than single-use development, crime reduction, blight reduction,
community stabilization, and property tax base maintenance or improvement. In making this
judgment, the commissioner shall give priority to eligible projects with one or more of the
following characteristics:
                                                                        b­o
     (1) the potential of the local governmental unit to attract viable ­ i­­c­e

                                                                                  c­
                                                                                   e innovative businesses;
   (2) proximity to public transit if located in a metropolitan county, as defined in section 473.121,
subdivision 4;
    (3) multijurisdictional eligible projects that take into account the need for affordable housing,
transportation, and environmental impact;
   (4) the eligible project is not relocating substantially the same operation from another location
in the state, unless the commissioner determines the eligible project cannot be reasonably
accommodated within the local governmental unit in which the business is currently located, or the
business would otherwise relocate to another state or country; and
     (5) the number of jobs that will be created.
   (b) The factors in paragraph (a) are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather, the commissioner
may weigh each factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner considers
appropriate.
    Subd. 6. Cancellation of grant. If a grant is awarded to a local governmental unit and funds are
not encumbered for the grant within four years after the award date, the grant must be canceled.
   Subd. 7. Repayment of grant. If an eligible project supported by public infrastructure funded
with a grant awarded under this section is not occupied by ­

accordance with the grant application under subdivision 4 within five years after the date of the last
grant payment, the grant recipient must repay the amount of the grant received. The commissioner
must deposit all money received under this subdivision into the state treasury and credit it to the
debt service account in the state bond fund.

(a) The commissioner of transportation shall develop rules, procedures for application for grants,
conditions of grant administration, standards, and criteria, including bridge specifications, in
cooperation with road authorities of political subdivisions, for use in the administration of funds
appropriated to the commissioner and for the administration of grants to subdivisions.
    (b) The maximum use of standardized bridges is encouraged. Regardless of the size of the
existing bridge, a bridge or replacement bridge is eligible for assistance from the state transportation
fund if a hydrological survey indicates that the bridge or replacement bridge must be ten feet or more
in length.
    (c) As part of the standards or rules, the commissioner shall, in consultation with local road
authorities, establish a minimum distance between any two bridges that cross over the same river,
stream, or waterway, so that only one of the bridges is eligible for a grant under this section. As
appropriate, the commissioner may establish exceptions from the minimum distance requirement
or procedures for obtaining a variance.
    (d) Funds appropriated to the commissioner from the Minnesota state transportation fund shall
be segregated from the highway tax user distribution fund and other funds created by article XIV
of the Constitution.

the project; and
    (iii) eligible programs consult with appropriate labor organizations to deliver education and
training.
      (b) The commissioner may give priority to:
    (1) projects that collaborate with child care providers, including all-day and school-age child care

     Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
     Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
  "Section 1. MINNESOTA ENTREPRENEUR RESOURCE VIRTUAL NETWORK
(MERVN).
    The commissioner of employment and economic development shall seek sufficient private
sector funding for the Office of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (OESBD)
to develop, maintain, and market a virtual network to provide seamless access to statewide
resources and expertise for entrepreneurs and existing businesses. The network must connect
Minnesota entrepreneurs to available state and nonstate supported services, information, financial
and technical assistance, and other resources. In developing and maintaining the network, OESBD
must ensure that all listed resources meet established standards. The goal of the network is to assist
in the creation of new Minnesota ventures, the growth of existing businesses, and the ability of
Minnesota entrepreneurs to compete globally. To the greatest extent possible, the network should
be built on and linked to existing resources designed to make business assistance resources more
accessible to Minnesota businesses."
     Delete the title and insert:
    "A bill for an act relating to economic development; authorizing the development of a virtual
assistance network for Minnesota entrepreneurs."
     And when so amended the bill do pass. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

    Subd. 17. Audits. The commissioner reserves the right to audit subject offerings with or without
notice to the sponsor.
    Subd. 18. Falsification of reports. A licensee, its qualified person, or an applicant found to
have falsified an education report to the commissioner shall be considered to have violated the laws
relating to the industry for which the person has a license and shall be subject to censure, limitation,
condition, suspension, or revocation of the license or denial of the application for licensure.
   The commissioner reserves the right to audit a licensee's continuing education records.
    Subd. 19. Waivers and extensions. If a licensee provides documentation to the commissioner
that the licensee or its qualifying person is unable, and will continue to be unable, to attend actual
classroom course work because of a physical disability, medical condition, or similar reason,
attendance at continuing education courses shall be waived for a period not to exceed one year.
The commissioner shall require that the licensee or its qualifying person satisfactorily complete a
self-study program to include reading a sufficient number of textbooks, or listening to a sufficient
number of tapes, related to the ­   r­

necessary for the licensee to satisfy continuing educational credit hour needs. The commissioner
shall award the licensee credit hours for a self-study program by determining how many credit
hours would be granted to a classroom course involving the same material and giving the licensee
the same number of credit hours under this section. The licensee may apply each year for a new
waiver upon the same terms and conditions as were necessary to secure the original waiver, and
must demonstrate that in subsequent years, the licensee was unable to complete actual classroom
course work. The commissioner may request documentation of the condition upon which the
request for waiver is based as is necessary to satisfy the commissioner of the existence of the
condition and that the condition does preclude attendance at continuing education courses.
    Upon written proof demonstrating a medical hardship, the commissioner shall extend, for up to
90 days, the time period during which the continuing education must be successfully completed.
Loss of income from either attendance at courses or cancellation of a license is not a bona fide
financial hardship. Requests for extensions must be submitted to the commissioner in writing no
later than 60 days before the education is due and must include an explanation with verification
of the hardship, plus verification of enrollment at an approved course of study on or before the
extension period expires.
   Subd. 20. Reporting requirements. Required continuing education must be reported in a

    Senator Marty from the Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security, to which was
referred
   S.F. No. 2986: A bill for an act relating to health; specifying certain aspects of prepaid health
plan contracts entered into by the commissioner of human services or county-based purchasing
7684                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [73RD DAY

plans; requiring use of certain accounting procedures; providing health care providers and others
a right to audit under those contracts; providing for resolution of disputes; amending Minnesota
Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivisions 5i, 9, by adding a subdivision.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 5i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5i. Administrative expenses. (a) Managed care plan and county-based purchasing plan
administrative costs for a prepaid health plan provided under this section or section 256B.692 must
not exceed by more than five percent that prepaid health plan's or county-based purchasing plan's
actual calculated administrative spending for the previous calendar year as a percentage of total
revenue. The penalty for exceeding this limit must be the amount of administrative spending in
excess of 105 percent of the actual calculated amount. The commissioner may waive this penalty if
the excess administrative spending is the result of unexpected shifts in enrollment or member needs
or new program requirements.
   (b) Expenses listed under section 62D.12, subdivision 9a, clause (4), are not allowable
administrative expenses for rate-setting purposes under this section, unless approved by the
commissioner.
    (c) A prepaid health plan must meet a loss ratio of not less than 93.5 percent, calculated as
specified in this paragraph. The loss ratio consists of a numerator consisting only of direct expenses
of providing patient care to persons covered under the program, excluding administrative expenses.
The denominator consists of the total amount paid by the commissioner to the prepaid health plan,
after subtraction of taxes and other mandatory government assessments directly attributable to the
plan's participation as a provider in the program being reported on. Payments by the prepaid health
plan to unaffiliated third parties or to providers or other entities that own, are owned by, or are
under common control with the plan must be divided into patient care expenses and administrative
expenses and included in the appropriate category for determination of the loss ratio.
    (d) A bid submitted by a prepaid health plan may include a provision obligating the bidder to
provide free services to uninsured, low-income persons as specified in the bid if necessary to meet
the required loss ratio, to the extent that the loss ratio for that year would otherwise not reach 93.5
percent.
   (e) Nothing in this subdivision requires the minimum loss ratio to be applied to any plan's
business other than that business awarded by the commissioner, unless the plan fails to keep a
separate and distinct accounting of funds received from the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Reporting. (a) Each demonstration provider shall submit information as required by
the commissioner, including data required for assessing client satisfaction, quality of care, cost,
and utilization of services for purposes of project evaluation. The commissioner shall also develop
methods of data reporting and collection in order to provide aggregate enrollee information on
encounters and outcomes to determine access and quality assurance. Required information shall

be specified before the commissioner contracts with a demonstration provider.
    (b) Aggregate nonpersonally identifiable health plan encounter data, aggregate spending data for
major categories of service as reported to the commissioners of health and commerce under section
62D.08, subdivision 3, clause (a), and criteria for service authorization and service use are public
data that the commissioner shall make available and use in public reports. The commissioner shall
require each health plan and county-based purchasing plan to provide:
    (1) encounter data for each service provided, using standard codes and unit of service definitions
set by the commissioner, in a form that the commissioner can report by age, eligibility groups, and
health plan; and
    (2) criteria, written policies, and procedures required to be disclosed under section 62M.10,
subdivision 7, and Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part 438.210(b)(1), used for each type of
service for which authorization is required.
    (c) All financial reporting, including reporting of administrative expenses, under this section
must be reported in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. If the commissioner
believes this paragraph would violate federal regulations, the commissioner shall promptly seek a
federal waiver to permit the state to comply with this paragraph. The commissioner may accept
donations to cover the cost of the waiver application.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9c. Rights to audit related to the loss ratio. (a) Within 90 days after the end of each
calendar year, each managed care plan used by the commissioner to provide services under this
section shall furnish to each provider that furnished services during the calendar year under a
contract with the plan a Web-based statement in reasonable detail setting forth the computation of
the total costs and expenses used in the calculation of the minimum loss ratio as well as the amount
of administrative expenses incurred in the prior calendar year.
    (b) Any provider or group of providers may, at its expense and after 14 days' written notice,
audit and inspect all records of the managed care plan relating to the costs and expenses which are
used in the calculation of the minimum loss ratio, provided that at the end of 24 months following
the end of any calendar year the plan's records shall be deemed to be conclusive, and the providers
have no further rights to audit and inspect them with regard to that calendar year.
    (c) In the event that an audit or inspection determines that a plan failed to satisfy the 93.5 percent
loss ratio requirement, the following shall apply:
    (1) the plan shall make a payment to the commissioner equal to the amount by which the plan
failed to satisfy the minimum loss ratio, to be deposited in the fund from which the payments to the
plan were made, as determined by the commissioner. If the commissioner cannot specify the fund,
the payment shall be deposited in the health care access fund; and
    (2) if the plan falls two percentage points or more short of satisfying the 93.5 percent minimum
loss ratio, the plan shall reimburse the provider or group of providers for reasonable costs incurred
for the audit or inspection.

    (d) No plan used by the commissioner may require any provider to waive this right to audit as
a condition of participation with the plan. No plan may retaliate against any provider for exercising
any rights related to the audit described in this subdivision.
    (e) If a plan and a provider or group of providers disagree regarding the result of an audit or
inspection of records conducted under this subdivision, the commissioner shall refer the dispute to
the attorney general for resolution. Each party shall pay its own expenses in connection with the
process of resolving the dispute.
   (f) An enrollee or group of enrollees has the right to conduct an audit and inspection of a plan's
records on the same basis granted under this subdivision to health care providers.
   (g) The commissioner shall describe the requirements of this subdivision in any request for
proposal for services to which this subdivision applies.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011."

of participation, or a termination of participation under section 256B.064. If a home care provider

commissioner 30 days prior to terminating services to the recipient, and must assist the recipient in
transitioning to another home care provider of the recipient's choice.
    (b) In the event of a payment withhold from a home care provider or a suspension or termination
of participation of a home care provider under section 256B.064, the commissioner may inform
the Office of Ombudsman for Long-Term Care and the lead agencies for all recipients with active
service agreements with the provider. At the commissioner's request, the lead agencies must contact
recipients to ensure that the recipients are continuing to receive needed care, and that the recipients
have been given free choice of provider if they transfer to another home care provider. In addition,
