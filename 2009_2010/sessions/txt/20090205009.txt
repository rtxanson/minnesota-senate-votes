   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Requirements. (a) Real estate consisting of ten acres or more or a nursery or
greenhouse, and qualifying for classification as class 2a or 2b under section 273.13, shall be
entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this section if it is primarily devoted to agricultural
use, and meets the requirements in subdivision 6, and either:
    (1) is the homestead of the owner, or of a surviving spouse, child, or sibling of the owner or is
real estate which is farmed with the real estate which contains the homestead property; or

    (2) has been in possession of the applicant, the applicant's spouse, parent, or sibling, or any
combination thereof, for a period of at least seven years prior to application for benefits under the
provisions of this section, or is real estate which is farmed with the real estate which qualifies under
this clause and is within four townships or cities or combination thereof from the qualifying real
estate; or
    (3) is the homestead of an individual who is part of an entity described in paragraph (b), clause
(1), (2), or (3); or
    (4) is in the possession of a nursery or greenhouse or an entity owned by a proprietor, partnership,
or corporation which also owns the nursery or greenhouse operations on the parcel or parcels,
provided that only the acres used to produce nursery stock qualify for treatment under this section.
       (b) Valuation of real estate under this section is limited to parcels owned by individuals except
for:
       (1) a family farm entity or authorized farm entity regulated under section 500.24;
    (2) a poultry entity other than a limited liability entity in which the majority of the members,
partners, or shareholders are related and at least one of the members, partners, or shareholders either
resides on the land or actively operates the land; and
    (3) corporations that derive 80 percent or more of their gross receipts from the wholesale or
retail sale of horticultural or nursery stock.
       The terms in this paragraph have the meanings given in section 500.24, where applicable.
     (c) Land that previously qualified for tax deferment under this section and no longer qualifies
because it is not primarily used for agricultural purposes but would otherwise qualify under

three years will not be required to make payment of the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding
the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land prior to the expiration of the three-year period
requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale in the year the land no longer qualifies requires
payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years;
sale during the second year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's
deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes for the prior year; and sale during the third year
the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes
shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or
no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the end of the three-year period, whichever comes
first, all deferred special assessments plus interest are payable in equal installments spread over
the time remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued to finance the improvement for
which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred special assessments
plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to
the collection of these installments. Penalties are not imposed on any such special assessments if
timely paid.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Determination of value. ­   (­
                                          a­
                                           ) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3
shall upon timely application by the owner, in the manner provided in subdivision 8, be determined
solely with reference to its appropriate agricultural classification and value notwithstanding
sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any added
values resulting from nonagricultural factors. In order to account for the presence of nonagricultural
influences that may affect the value of agricultural land, the commissioner of revenue shall develop
a fair and uniform method of determining agricultural values for each county in the state that are
consistent with this subdivision. The commissioner shall annually assign the resulting values to
each county, and these values shall be used as the basis for determining the agricultural value for
all properties in the county qualifying for tax deferment under this section.

includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or
the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or
federal conservation program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision
for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Contiguous acreage on the
same parcel, or contiguous acreage on an immediately adjacent parcel under the same ownership,
may also qualify as agricultural land, but only if it is pasture, timber, waste, unusable wild land, or
land included in state or federal farm programs. Agricultural classification for property shall be
determined excluding the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one acre of land, and shall
not be based upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels
under the same ownership.

including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be

of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.

which the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.

       ) (i) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to
be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.

    S.F. No. 93: A bill for an act relating to state tort claims; removing the single occurrence liability
cap; conforming cross references; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 3.736, subdivision

    "Section 1. FINDINGS.
    The legislature finds that the state and municipal tort liability limitations contained in Minnesota
Statutes, sections 3.736 and 466.04, are rationally related to the legitimate government objective
of ensuring fiscal stability to meet and carry out the manifold responsibilities of government. The
legislature finds that, unlike municipalities, the state of Minnesota has the fiscal capacity and ability
to absorb the cost of and pay for multiple tort claims arising out of a single occurrence without
a dollar limitation on that liability. The ability of the state to respond to monetary judgments is
quantitatively greater than that of a municipality because of significant differences in the size of
their respective budgets and their tax base and taxing authority. A limitation on the total liability
of municipalities for multiple tort claims arising out of a single occurrence is necessary to protect
the fiscal stability and integrity of municipalities and to protect the taxpayers within municipalities
from the effect of unlimited tort liability exposure. The legislature retains and reaffirms the public
purpose served by the continuance of the limitation on liability for tort claims arising out of a single
occurrence applicable to municipalities under Minnesota Statutes, section 466.04."

    Subd. 7. Payment. A state agency, including an entity defined as part of the state in section
3.732, subdivision 1, clause (1), incurring a tort claim judgment or settlement obligation or whose
employees acting within the scope of their employment incur the obligation shall seek approval to
make payment by submitting a written request to the commissioner of finance. The request shall
contain a description of the tort claim that causes the request, specify the amount of the obligation
and be accompanied by copies of judgments, settlement agreements or other documentation
relevant to the obligation for which the agency seeks payment. Upon receipt of the request
and review of the claim, the commissioner of finance shall determine the proper appropriation
from which to make payment. If there is enough money in an appropriation or combination of
appropriations to the agency for its general operations and management to pay the claim without
unduly hindering the operation of the agency, the commissioner shall direct that payment be made
from that source, except that payment may not be made from the trunk highway fund in excess of
the amount specifically appropriated by the legislature for payment of tort claims. Claims relating
to activities paid for by appropriations of dedicated receipts shall be paid from those appropriations
if practicable. On determining that an agency has sufficient money in these appropriations to
pay only part of a claim, the commissioner shall pay the remainder of the claim from the money
appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose. On determining that the agency does not have
enough money to pay any part of the claim, the commissioner shall pay all of the claim from money
appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose. Payment shall be made only upon receipt of a
written release by the claimant in a form approved by the attorney general, or the person designated
as the university attorney, as the case may be.
   No attachment or execution shall issue against the state."

the limit in Minnesota Statutes, section 466.04, subdivision 1, clause (7), is unconstitutional based
on the amendments in this act."
