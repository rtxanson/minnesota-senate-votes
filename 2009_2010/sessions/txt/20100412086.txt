tree and brush burning site may be given by the commissioner or agent of the commissioner.
Applicants for a permanent open burning site permit shall submit a complete application on a form
provided by the commissioner. Existing permanent tree and brush open burning sites must submit
for a permit within 90 days of the passage of this statute for a burning permit. New site applications
must be submitted at least 90 days before the date of the proposed operation of the permanent open
burning site. The application must be submitted to the commissioner and must contain:
   (1) the name, address, and telephone number of all owners of the site proposed for use as the
permanent open burning site;
   (2) if the operator for the proposed permanent open burning site is different from the owner, the
name, address, and telephone number of the operator;
    (3) a general description of the materials to be burned, including the source and estimated
quantity, dimensions of the site and burn pile areas, hours and dates of operation, and provisions
for smoke management; and
    (4) a topographic or similarly detailed map of the site and surrounding area within a one mile
circumference showing all structures that might be affected by the operation of the site.
    Only trees, tree trimmings, or brush that cannot be disposed of by an alternative method such as
chipping, composting, or other method shall be permitted to be burned at a permanent open burning
site. A permanent tree and brush open burning site must be located and operated so as not to create

    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.041, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Reoffering unsold timber. To maintain and enhance forest ecosystems on state forest
lands, the commissioner may reoffer timber tracts remaining unsold under the provisions of section
90.101 below appraised value at public auction with the required 30-day notice under section 90.101,
subdivision 2.
    Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.121, is amended to read:
    90.121 INTERMEDIATE AUCTION SALES; MAXIMUM LOTS OF 3,000 CORDS.
    (a) The commissioner may sell the timber on any tract of state land in lots not exceeding 3,000
cords in volume, in the same manner as timber sold at public auction under section 90.101, and
related laws, subject to the following special exceptions and limitations:
    (1) the commissioner shall offer all tracts authorized for sale by this section separately from the
sale of tracts of state timber made pursuant to section 90.101;
    (2) no bidder may be awarded more than 25 percent of the total tracts offered at the first round
of bidding unless fewer than four tracts are offered, in which case not more than one tract shall
be awarded to one bidder. Any tract not sold at public auction may be offered for private sale as
authorized by section 90.101, subdivision 1, to persons eligible under this section at the appraised
value; and
    (3) no sale may be made to a person having more than 2  0
                                                              30 employees. For the purposes of
this clause, "employee" means an individual working for salary or wages on a full-time or part-time
basis.
    (b) The auction sale procedure set forth in this section constitutes an additional alternative timber
sale procedure available to the commissioner and is not intended to replace other authority possessed
by the commissioner to sell timber in lots of 3,000 cords or less.
    (c) Another bidder or the commissioner may request that the number of employees a bidder
has pursuant to paragraph (a), clause (3), be confirmed if there is evidence that the bidder may be
ineligible due to exceeding the employee threshold. The commissioner shall request information
from the commissioner of labor and industry including the premiums paid by the bidder in question
for workers' compensation insurance coverage for all employees of the bidder. The commissioner

shall review the information submitted by the commissioner of labor and industry and make a
determination based on the information as to whether the bidder is eligible.
    Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.14, is amended to read:
    90.14 AUCTION SALE PROCEDURE.
   (a) All state timber shall be offered and sold by the same unit of measurement as it was appraised.
No tract shall be sold to any person other than the purchaser in whose name the bid was made. The
commissioner may refuse to approve any and all bids received and cancel a sale of state timber for
good and sufficient reasons.
    (b) The purchaser at any sale of timber shall, immediately upon the approval of the bid, or,
if unsold at public auction, at the time of purchase at a subsequent sale under section 90.101,
subdivision 1, pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the appraised value. In
case any purchaser fails to make such payment, the purchaser shall be liable therefor to the state in
a civil action, and the commissioner may reoffer the timber for sale as though no bid or sale under
section 90.101, subdivision 1, therefor had been made.
    (c) In lieu of the scaling of state timber required by this chapter, a purchaser of state timber may,
at the time of payment by the purchaser to the commissioner of 15 percent of the appraised value,
elect in writing on a form prescribed by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the
appraiser's estimate of the volume of timber described in the permit, provided that the commissioner
has expressly designated the availability of such option for that tract on the list of tracts available
for sale as required under section 90.101. A purchaser who elects in writing on a form prescribed
by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the appraiser's estimate of the volume
of timber described on the permit does not have recourse to the provisions of section 90.281.
    (d) In the case of a public auction sale conducted by a sealed bid process, tracts shall be
awarded to the high bidder, who shall pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the
appraised value wt

section 90.151, the commissioner shall require the purchaser  sh

1979, chapter 199, to reclassify those types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands previously identified as public waters
wetlands under Laws 1979, chapter 199, as public waters or as wetlands under section 103G.005,
subdivision 19. The commissioner may only reclassify public waters wetlands as public waters if:
   (1) they are assigned a shoreland management classification by the commissioner under sections
103F.201 to 103F.221;
   (2) they are classified as lacustrine wetlands or deepwater habitats according to Classification of
Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (Cowardin, et al., 1979 edition); or
    (3) the state or federal government has become titleholder to any of the beds or shores of the
public waters wetlands, subsequent to the preparation of the public waters inventory map filed with
the auditor of the county, pursuant to paragraph (a), and the responsible state or federal agency
declares that the water is necessary for the purposes of the public ownership.
    (c) The commissioner must provide notice of the reclassification to the local government unit,
the county board, the watershed district, if one exists for the area, and the soil and water conservation
district. Within 60 days of receiving notice from the commissioner, a party required to receive
the notice may provide a resolution stating objections to the reclassification. If the commissioner
receives an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the reclassification is not effective.
If the commissioner does not receive an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the
reclassification of a wetland under paragraph (b) is effective 60 days after the notice is received by
all of the parties.

APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Monitoring equipment. The commissioner may require the installation
and maintenance of monitoring equipment to evaluate water resource impacts from permitted
appropriations and proposed projects that require a permit. Monitoring for water resources that
supply more than one appropriator must be designed to minimize costs to individual appropriators.
    Subd. 2. Measuring devices required. Monitoring installations required under subdivision 1
must be equipped with automated measuring devices to measure water levels, flows, or conditions.
The commissioner may determine the frequency of measurements and other measuring methods
based on the quantity of water appropriated or used, the source of water, potential connections to
other water resources, the method of appropriating or using water, seasonal and long-term changes
in water levels, and any other facts supplied to the commissioner.
   Subd. 3. Reports and costs. (a) Records of water measurements under subdivision 2 must be
kept for each installation. The measurements must be reported annually to the commissioner on or
before February 15 of the following year in a format or on forms prescribed by the commissioner.
    (b) The owner or person in charge of an installation for appropriating or using waters of the state
or a proposal that requires a permit is responsible for all costs related to establishing and maintaining
monitoring installations and to measuring and reporting data. Monitoring costs for water resources
that supply more than one appropriator may be distributed among all users within a monitoring
area determined by the commissioner and assessed based on volumes of water appropriated and

    Subdivision 1. Waiver. The commissioner may waive a limitation or requirement in subdivisions
2 to 6 for just cause.
    Subd. 2. Applications for groundwater appropriations. Groundwater use permit applications
are not complete until the applicant has supplied:
    (1) a water well record as required by section 103I.205, subdivision 9, information on the
subsurface geologic formations penetrated by the well and the formation or aquifer that will serve
as the water source, and geologic information from test holes drilled to locate the site of the
production well;
   (2) the maximum daily, seasonal, and annual pumpage rates and volumes being requested;
    (3) information on groundwater quality in terms of the measures of quality commonly specified
for the proposed water use and details on water treatment necessary for the proposed use;
    (4) an inventory of existing wells within 1-1/2 miles of the proposed production well or within
the area of influence, as determined by the commissioner. The inventory must include information on
well locations, depths, geologic formations, depth of the pump or intake, pumping and nonpumping
water levels, and details of well construction; and
   (5) the results of an aquifer test completed according to specifications approved by the
commissioner. The test must be conducted at the maximum pumping rate requested in the
application and for a length of time adequate to assess or predict impacts to other wells and surface
water and groundwater resources. The permit applicant is responsible for all costs related to the
aquifer test, including the construction of groundwater and surface water monitoring installations,
and water level readings before, during, and after the aquifer test.
   Subd. 3. Relationship to surface water resources. Groundwater appropriations that have
potential impacts to surface waters are subject to applicable provisions in section 103G.285.
   Subd. 4. Protection of groundwater supplies. The commissioner may establish water
appropriation limits to protect groundwater resources. When establishing water appropriation
limits to protect groundwater resources, the commissioner must consider current and projected
water levels and water supply management objectives in section 103G.265, subdivision 1.
   Subd. 5. Groundwater management areas. The commissioner may designate groundwater
management areas and limit total annual water appropriations and uses within a designated area to
ensure future supplies. Water appropriations and uses within a designated management area must be
consistent with a plan approved by the commissioner that addresses water conservation requirements
and water allocation priorities established in section 103G.261.

    Subd. 6. Interference with other wells. The commissioner may issue water use permits for
appropriation from groundwater only if the commissioner determines that adequate water supplies
are available for the proposed use without reducing water levels beyond the reach of public water
supply and private domestic wells constructed according to Minnesota Rules, chapter 4725.
    Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103G.301, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general
application throughout the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances, or conditions
in order to make due allowance for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may
relate to sources or emissions of air contamination or air pollution, to the quality or composition of
such emissions, or to the quality of or composition of the ambient air or outdoor atmosphere or to
any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution.
     (b) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions hereof, the Pollution
Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1969, chapter 1046, for the collection, transportation,
storage, processing, and disposal of solid waste and the prevention, abatement, or control of water,
air, and land pollution which may be related thereto, and the deposit in or on land of any other
material that may tend to cause pollution. The agency shall adopt such rules and standards for sewage
sludge, addressing the intrinsic suitability of land, the volume and rate of application of sewage
sludge of various degrees of intrinsic hazard, design of facilities, and operation of facilities and sites.
Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or may be limited as
to times, places, circumstances, or conditions in order to make due allowance for variations therein.
Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to collection, transportation, processing, disposal,
equipment, location, procedures, methods, systems or techniques or to any other matter relevant to
the prevention, abatement or control of water, air, and land pollution which may be advised through
the control of collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge,
and the deposit in or on land of any other material that may tend to cause pollution. By January 1,
1983, the rules for the management of sewage sludge shall include an analysis of the sewage sludge
determined by the commissioner of agriculture to be necessary to meet the soil amendment labeling
requirements of section 18C.215.

Control Agency may adopt, amend and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1971, chapter 727, for the prevention, abatement,
or control of noise pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout
the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances or conditions in order to make due
allowances for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to sources
or emissions of noise or noise pollution, to the quality or composition of noises in the natural
environment, or to any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of noise
pollution.
   (f) As to any matters subject to this chapter, local units of government may set emission
regulations with respect to stationary sources which are more stringent than those set by the
Pollution Control Agency.
    (g) Pursuant to chapter 14, the Pollution Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules
and standards having the force of law relating to any purpose within the provisions of this chapter
for generators of hazardous waste, the management, identification, labeling, classification, storage,
collection, treatment, transportation, processing, and disposal of hazardous waste and the location of
hazardous waste facilities. A rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or
may be limited as to time, places, circumstances, or conditions. In implementing its hazardous waste
rules, the Pollution Control Agency shall give high priority to providing planning and technical
assistance to hazardous waste generators. The agency shall assist generators in investigating the
availability and feasibility of both interim and long-term hazardous waste management methods.
The methods shall include waste reduction, waste separation, waste processing, resource recovery,
and temporary storage.
   (h) The Pollution Control Agency shall give highest priority in the consideration of permits to
authorize disposal of diseased shade trees by open burning at designated sites to evidence concerning
economic costs of transportation and disposal of diseased shade trees by alternative methods.

   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116.07, subdivision 4h, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4h. Financial responsibility rules. (a) The agency shall adopt rules requiring the operator
or owner of a solid waste disposal facility to submit to the agency proof of the operator's or owner's
financial capability to provide reasonable and necessary response during the operating life of the
facility and for a minimum of 30 years after closure for a mixed municipal solid waste disposal
facility or for a minimum of 20 years after closure, as determined by agency rules, for any other solid
waste disposal facility, and to provide for the closure of the facility and postclosure care required
under agency rules. Proof of financial responsibility is required of the operator or owner of a facility
receiving an original permit or a permit for expansion after adoption of the rules. Within 180 days of
the effective date of the rules or by July 1, 1987, whichever is later, proof of financial responsibility
is required of an operator or owner of a facility with a remaining capacity of more than five years or
500,000 cubic yards that is in operation at the time the rules are adopted. Compliance with the rules
and the requirements of paragraph (b) is a condition of obtaining or retaining a permit to operate
the facility.

    (b) A municipality, as defined in section 475.51, subdivision 2, including a sanitary district, that
owns or operates a solid waste disposal facility that was in operation on May 15, 1989, may meet its
financial responsibility for all or a portion of the contingency action portion of the reasonable and
necessary response costs at the facility by pledging its full faith and credit to meet its responsibility.
    The pledge must be made in accordance with the requirements in chapter 475 for issuing bonds
of the municipality, and the following additional requirements:
    (1) The governing body of the municipality shall enact an ordinance that clearly accepts
responsibility for the costs of contingency action at the facility and that reserves, during the
operating life of the facility and for the time period required in paragraph (a) after closure, a portion
of the debt limit of the municipality, as established under section 475.53 or other law, that is equal
to the total contingency action costs.
   (2) The municipality shall require that all collectors that haul to the facility implement a plan for
reducing solid waste by using volume-based pricing, recycling incentives, or other means.
    (3) When a municipality opts to meet a portion of its financial responsibility by relying on its
authority to issue bonds, it shall also begin setting aside in a dedicated long-term care trust fund
money that will cover a portion of the potential contingency action costs at the facility, the amount
to be determined by the agency for each facility based on at least the amount of waste deposited in
the disposal facility each year, and the likelihood and potential timing of conditions arising at the
facility that will necessitate response action. The agency may not require a municipality to set aside
more than five percent of the total cost in a single year.
   (4) A municipality shall have and consistently maintain an investment grade bond rating as a
condition of using bonding authority to meet financial responsibility under this section.
    (5) The municipality shall file with the commissioner of revenue its consent to have the amount
of its contingency action costs deducted from state aid payments otherwise due the municipality
and paid instead to the remediation fund created in section 116.155, if the municipality fails to
conduct the contingency action at the facility when ordered by the agency. If the agency notifies the
commissioner that the municipality has failed to conduct contingency action when ordered by the
agency, the commissioner shall deduct the amounts indicated by the agency from the state aids in
accordance with the consent filed with the commissioner.
   (6) The municipality shall file with the agency written proof that it has complied with the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (c) The method for proving financial responsibility under paragraph (b) may not be applied to
a new solid waste disposal facility or to expansion of an existing facility, unless the expansion is
a vertical expansion. Vertical expansions of qualifying existing facilities cannot be permitted for a
duration of longer than three years.
    (d) The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget for
guidance on the forms of financial assurance that are acceptable for private owners and public
owners, and in carrying out a periodic review of the adequacy of financial assurance for solid waste
disposal facilities. Financial assurance rules shall allow financial mechanisms to public owners of
solid waste disposal facilities that are appropriate to their status as subdivisions of the state.

to use the funds contributed solely for the management of nongame wildlife projects and further
agrees that it will not impose additional conditions or restrictions that will limit or otherwise restrict
the ability of the commissioner of natural resources to use the available funds for the most efficient
and effective management of nongame wildlife. The commissioner may use funds appropriated for
nongame wildlife programs for the purpose of developing, preserving, restoring, and maintaining
wintering habitat for neotropical migrant birds in Latin America and the Caribbean under agreement
or contract with any nonprofit organization dedicated to the construction, maintenance, and repair of
such projects that are acceptable to the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the land and
water affected by the projects. Under this authority, the commissioner may execute agreements and
contracts if the commissioner determines that the use of the funds will benefit neotropical migrant
birds that breed in or migrate through the state.

policy committees with recommendations for changes to this subdivision that are necessary for the
stream easement payment rates to reflect current shoreland market values. The recommendations
may include an adjustment to the dollar amount in paragraph (a), clause (1).

    d) In addition to the base tax rate, there is an additional assessment for the calendar year on the
quarterly unemployment taxes due from every taxpaying employer if the amount in the trust fund
on March 31 of the prior year is less than 0.55 percent of total wages paid in covered employment.
The assessment is as follows:
   (1) a five percent assessment if the trust fund is less than 0.55 percent but equal to or more than
0.45 percent;
   (2) a ten percent assessment if the trust fund is less than 0.45 percent but equal to or more than
0.35 percent; or

       (1) the employer's experience rating is limited by the maximum under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b);
       (2) the employer has ceased doing business; or
  (3) the unemployment benefits paid have been determined not to be used in computing the
employer's experience rating under section 268.047, subdivision 2 or 3.

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.07, as amended by Laws 2009, chapter 15, sections
5 and 6, and chapter 78, article 3, section 6, and article 4, sections 19 to 21, is amended to read:
    268.07 BENEFIT ACCOUNT.
    Subdivision 1. Application for unemployment benefits; determination of benefit account.
(a) An application for unemployment benefits may be filed in person, by mail, or by electronic
transmission as the commissioner may require. The applicant must be unemployed at the time
the application is filed and must provide all requested information in the manner required. If
the applicant is not unemployed at the time of the application or fails to provide all requested
information, the communication is not considered an application for unemployment benefits.
    (b) The commissioner must examine each application for unemployment benefits to determine
the base period and the benefit year, and based upon all the covered employment in the base period

the commissioner   s
                     h l must determine the weekly unemployment benefit amount available, if any,
                       al
and the maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, if any. The determination, which is a
document separate and distinct from a document titled a determination of eligibility or determination
of ineligibility issued under section 268.101, must be titled determination of benefit account. A
determination of benefit account must be sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by
mail or electronic transmission.
    (c) If a base period employer did not provide wage detail information for the applicant as required
under section 268.044, or provided erroneous information, or wage detail is not yet due and the
applicant is using an alternate base period under section 268.035, subdivision 4, paragraph (d),
the commissioner may accept an applicant certification of wage credits, based upon the applicant's
records, and issue a determination of benefit account.
    (d) An employer must provide wage detail information on an applicant within five calendar days
of request by the commissioner, in a manner and format requested, when:
    (1) the applicant is using an alternate base period under section 268.035, subdivision 4, paragraph
(d); and
    (2) wage detail under section 268.044 is not yet required to have been filed by the employer.
    (e) The commissioner may, at any time within 24 months from the establishment of a benefit
account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended determination if
the commissioner finds that the wage credits listed in the determination wa
                                                                             s were incorrect for any
reason. An amended determination of benefit account must be promptly sent to the applicant and
all base period employers, by mail or electronic transmission. This subdivision does not apply to
documents titled determinations of eligibility or determinations of ineligibility issued under section
268.101.
    (f) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly unemployment benefit
amount or maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, any unemployment benefits
that have been paid greater than the applicant was entitled is considered an overpayment of
unemployment benefits. A determination or amended determination issued under this section that
results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount of the overpayment
and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid unemployment benefits
must be repaid.

applicant must have wage credits in the high quarter of $1,000 or more.
    (b) To establish a new benefit account within 52 calendar weeks following the expiration of the
benefit year on a prior benefit account, an applicant must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)
and must have performed services in covered employment in a calendar quarter that started after
the effective date of the prior benefit account. The wage credits for those services must be at least
eight times the weekly benefit amount on the prior benefit account. One of the reasons for this
paragraph is to prevent an applicant from establishing a second benefit account as a result of one
loss of employment.
   Subd. 2a. Weekly unemployment benefit amount and maximum amount of unemployment
benefits available. 
                    (
                     b) (a) If an applicant has established a benefit account under subdivision 2, the
weekly unemployment benefit amount available during the applicant's benefit year is the higher of:
   (1) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the base period, to a maximum of
66-2/3 percent of the state's average weekly wage; or
   (2) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the high quarter, to a maximum of
43 percent of the state's average weekly wage.
   The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (1) is computed by dividing the total wage
credits by 52. The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (2) is computed by dividing the
high quarter wage credits by 13.
    
    (
     c
      ) (b) The state's maximum weekly benefit amount, computed in accordance with section
268.035, subdivision 23, applies to a benefit account established effective on or after the last
Sunday in October. Once established, an applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount is not
affected by the last Sunday in October change in the state's maximum weekly unemployment
benefit amount.
   
   (d
    ) (c) The maximum amount of unemployment benefits available on any benefit account is the
lower of:
      (1) 33-1/3 percent of the applicant's total wage credits; or
      (2) 26 times the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount.

the consequences of not appealing. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with
section 268.105.

    (b) Any applicant or base period employer may appeal from a determination or amended
determination of benefit account on the issue of whether services performed constitute employment

an
 d, whether the employment is considered covered employment, and whether money paid
constitutes wages. Proceedings on the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    Subd. 3b. Limitations on applications and benefit accounts. (a) An application for
unemployment benefits is effective the Sunday of the calendar week that the application was
filed. An application for unemployment benefits may be backdated one calendar week before the
Sunday of the week the application was actually filed if the applicant requests the backdating at
the time the application is filed. An application may be backdated only if the applicant had no
employment during the period of the backdating. If an individual attempted to file an application
for unemployment benefits, but was prevented from filing an application by the department, the
application is effective the Sunday of the calendar week the individual first attempted to file an
application.
   (b) A benefit account established under subdivision 2 is effective the date the application for

   (c) A benefit account, once established, may later be withdrawn only if:
   (1) the applicant has not been paid any unemployment benefits on that benefit account; and
    (2) a new application for unemployment benefits is filed and a new benefit account is established
at the time of the withdrawal.
   A determination or amended determination of eligibility or ineligibility issued under section
268.101, that was sent before the withdrawal of the benefit account, remains in effect and is
not voided by the withdrawal of the benefit account. A determination of ineligibility requiring
subsequent earnings to satisfy the period of ineligibility under section 268.095, subdivision 10,
applies to the weekly unemployment benefit amount on the new benefit account.
   (d) An application for unemployment benefits is not allowed before the Sunday following the
expiration of the benefit year on a prior benefit account. Except as allowed under paragraph (c), an
applicant may establish only one benefit account each 52 calendar weeks.

otherwise entitled to some amount of unemployment benefits. This clause does not apply if the
applicant would have been entitled to federal disaster unemployment assistance because of a
disaster in Minnesota, but for the applicant's establishment of a benefit account under section
268.07; and
    (7) the applicant has been participating in reemployment assistance services, such as job search

where the use of the inflatable is incidental to the primary use of the facility.
   (c) "Inflatable" means an amusement device, used to bounce or otherwise play on, that

for commercial use.
   (e) "Person" has the meaning given in section 302A.011, subdivision 22.

be kept in force during the entire period of registration. In the event of a policy cancellation, the
insurer will send written notice to the commissioner of labor and industry at the same time that a

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012.
   Sec. 3. [326B.092] FEES.
   Subdivision 1. Licenses requiring examination administered by commissioner. (a) If the
applicant for a license must pass an examination administered by the commissioner in order to
obtain the license, then the application for the initial license must be accompanied by an application
and examination fee of $50, which is separate from the license fee. The license fee is due after the
applicant passes the examination and before the license is issued.
   (b) If the applicant for a Minnesota license holds a license in another state and is seeking
Minnesota licensure without examination based on reciprocity, then the application for the
Minnesota license must be accompanied by the application and examination fee of $50, which is
separate from the license fee. If the commissioner approves the application, then the license fee is
due before the license is issued.
    Subd. 2. Licenses not requiring examination administered by commissioner. If the applicant
for a license is not required to pass an examination in order to obtain the license, or is required to pass
an examination that is not administered by the commissioner, then the license fee must accompany
the application for the license. If the application is for a license issued under sections 326B.802
to 326B.885 and is not an application for license renewal, then the contractor recovery fund fee
required under section 326B.89, subdivision 3, is due after the department has determined that the
applicant meets the qualifications for licensing and before the license is issued.
    Subd. 3. Late fee. The department must receive a complete application for license renewal by
the renewal deadline but not more than 90 days before the renewal deadline. If the department
receives a renewal application after the expiration of the license, then the renewal application must

of calculating the late fee only, the license renewal fee shall not include any contractor recovery fund
fee required by section 326B.89, subdivision 3.

after expiration of the license, the renewal application must be accompanied by all license renewal
fees to cover the period that the license was expired, plus the late fee described in subdivision 3 and
the license renewal fee for the current renewal period.
    Subd. 5. Insufficient fees. If the applicant does not include all required fees with the application,
then the application will be incomplete and the department will notify the applicant of the amount
of the deficiency.
    Subd. 6. Fees nonrefundable. Application and examination fees, license fees, license renewal
fees, and late fees are nonrefundable except for:
    (1) license renewal fees received more than two years after expiration of the license, as described

    (b) For purposes of this section, "license duration" means the number of years for which the
license is issued except that:
   (1) if the initial license is not issued for a whole number of years, the license duration shall be
rounded up to the next whole number; and
     (2) if the department receives an application for license renewal after the renewal deadline,
license duration means the number of years for which the renewed license would have been issued
if the renewal application had been submitted on time and all other requirements for renewal had
been met.
    (c) The base license fee shall depend on whether the license is classified as an entry level, master,
journeyman, or business license, and on the license duration. The base license fee shall be:
License Classification                     License Duration
                          1 Year                    2 Years                    3 Years
Entry level               $10                       $20                        $30
Journeyman                $20                       $40                        $60

    (d) If there is a continuing education requirement for renewal of the license, then a continuing
education fee must be included in the renewal license fee. The continuing education fee for all
license classifications shall be: $10 if the renewal license duration is one year; $20 if the renewal
license duration is two years; and $30 if the renewal license duration is three years.
    (e) If the license is issued under sections 326B.31 to 326B.59 or 326B.90 to 326B.93, then a
board fee must be included in the license fee and the renewal license fee. The board fee for all
license classifications shall be: $4 if the license duration is one year; $8 if the license duration is
two years; and $12 if the license duration is three years.
    (f) If the application is for the renewal of a license issued under sections 326B.802 to 326B.885,
then the contractor recovery fund fee required under section 326B.89, subdivision 3, and any
additional assessment required under section 326B.89, subdivision 16, must be included in the

86TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 12, 2010                                        9455

   Subdivision 1. Qualifications for examination. If the applicant for a license must pass an
examination administered by the commissioner in order to obtain the license, then the applicant's
complete application must demonstrate that the applicant is qualified to take the examination. The
applicant is qualified to take the examination if the applicant meets all requirements for the license
except for passing the examination.
   Subd. 2. Not qualified for examination. If the applicant is not qualified to take the examination,
then the commissioner must deny the application. The applicant may subsequently submit another
application, accompanied by the required fee.
   Subd. 3. Taking the examination. If the applicant is qualified to take the examination, then the
department must notify the applicant, and the applicant may schedule a time to take the examination
within one year after the notification date. If the applicant does not take the examination at the
scheduled time, the applicant may, one time only, reschedule a time to take the examination on
a date within one year after the notification date. If the applicant fails to take the examination
within one year after the notification date, the commissioner must deny the application and the
applicant forfeits the application/examination fee. The applicant may subsequently submit another
application, accompanied by the required application/examination fee.
    Subd. 4. Examination results. If the applicant receives a passing score on the examination and
meets all other requirements for licensure, the commissioner must approve the application and notify
the applicant of the approval within 60 days of the date of the passing score. The applicant must,
within 90 days after the notification of approval, pay the license fee. Upon receipt of the license fee,
the commissioner must issue the license. If the applicant does not pay the license fee within 90 days
after the notification of approval, the commissioner will rescind the approval and must deny the
application. If the applicant does not receive a passing score on the examination, the commissioner
must deny the application. If the application is denied because of the applicant's failure to receive a
passing score on the examination, then the applicant cannot submit a new application for the license
until at least 30 days after the notification of denial.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012.
   Sec. 5. [326B.094] RENEWAL OF LICENSES.

a renewal of a license, the license expires on the expiration date printed on the license. While the
license is expired, the licensee cannot perform the activities authorized by the license.
    Subd. 2. Availability of renewal. A licensee may apply to renew a license no later than two
years after the expiration of the license. If the department receives a complete renewal application
no later than two years after the expiration of the license, then the department must approve or
deny the renewal application within 60 days of receiving the complete renewal application. If the
department receives a renewal application more than two years after the expiration of the license,
the department must return the renewal license fee to the applicant without approving or denying
the application. If the licensee wishes to obtain a valid license more than two years after expiration
of the license, the licensee must apply for a new license.
    Subd. 3. Deadline for avoiding license expiration. The department must receive a complete
application to renew a license no later than the renewal deadline. If the department does not receive
a complete application by the renewal deadline, the license may expire before the department has

   Sec. 6. [326B.095] INCOMPLETE LICENSE APPLICATIONS.
    This section applies to both applications for initial licenses and license renewal applications.
If the department determines that an application is incomplete, the department must notify the
applicant of the deficiencies that must be corrected in order to complete the application. If
the applicant wishes to complete the application, the department must receive the completed
application within 90 days after the date the department mailed or delivered the incomplete
application to the applicant. If the department does not receive the completed application by this

A journeyman plumber may also work as a restricted journeyman plumber. Anyone not so licensed
may do plumbing work which complies with the provisions of the minimum standards prescribed
by the Plumbing Board on premises or that part of premises owned and actually occupied by the
worker as a residence, unless otherwise forbidden to do so by a local ordinance.
    (b) No person shall engage in the business of planning, superintending, or installing plumbing
or shall install plumbing in connection with the dealing in and selling of plumbing material and
supplies unless at all times a licensed master plumber, or in cities and towns with a population
of fewer than 5,000 according to the last federal census, a restricted master plumber, who shall
be responsible for proper installation, is in charge of the plumbing work of the person,

work with or without compensation unless the person obtains a contractor's license. A contractor's
license does not of itself qualify its holder to perform the plumbing work authorized by holding a
master, journeyman, restricted master, or restricted journeyman license.
   Subd. 1a. Exemptions from licensing. (a) An individual without a contractor license may do
plumbing work on the individual's residence in accordance with subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    (b) An individual who is an employee working on the maintenance and repair of plumbing
equipment, apparatus, or facilities owned or leased by the individual's employer and which is within
the limits of property owned or leased, and operated or maintained by the individual's employer,
shall not be required to maintain a contractor license as long as the employer has on file with
the commissioner a current certificate of responsible person. The certificate must be signed by the
responsible master plumber or, in an area of the state that is not a city or town with a population of
more than 5,000 according to the last federal census, restricted master plumber, and must state that
the person signing the certificate is responsible for ensuring that the maintenance and repair work
performed by the employer's employees comply with sections 326B.41 to 326B.49, all rules adopted
under those sections and sections 326B.50 to 326B.59, and all orders issued under section 326B.082.
The employer must pay a filing fee to file a certificate of responsible person with the commissioner.
The certificate shall expire two years from the date of filing. In order to maintain a current certificate
of responsible person, the employer must resubmit a certificate of responsible person, with a filing
fee, no later than two years from the date of the previous submittal. The filing of the certificate of
responsible person does not exempt any employee of the employer from the requirements of this
chapter regarding individual licensing as a plumber or registration as a plumber's apprentice.
    (c) If a contractor employs a licensed plumber, the licensed plumber does not need a separate
contractor license to perform plumbing work on behalf of the employer within the scope of the
licensed plumber's license.
    Subd. 1b. Employment of master plumber or restricted master plumber. (a) Each contractor
must designate a responsible licensed plumber, who shall be responsible for the performance
of all plumbing work in accordance with sections 326B.41 to 326B.49, all rules adopted under
these sections and sections 326B.50 to 326B.59, and all orders issued under section 326B.082.
A plumbing contractor's responsible licensed plumber must be a master plumber. A restricted
plumbing contractor's responsible licensed plumber must be a master plumber or a restricted master
plumber. A plumbing contractor license authorizes the contractor to offer to perform and, through
licensed and registered individuals, to perform plumbing work in all areas of the state. A restricted
plumbing contractor license authorizes the contractor to offer to perform and, through licensed and
registered individuals, to perform plumbing work in all areas of the state except in cities and towns
with a population of more than 5,000 according to the last federal census.
    (b) If the contractor is an individual or sole proprietorship, the responsible licensed plumber
must be the individual, proprietor, or managing employee. If the contractor is a partnership, the
responsible licensed plumber must be a general partner or managing employee. If the contractor is
a limited liability company, the responsible licensed plumber must be a chief manager or managing
employee. If the contractor is a corporation, the responsible licensed plumber must be an officer or
managing employee. If the responsible licensed plumber is a managing employee, the responsible
licensed plumber must be actively engaged in performing plumbing work on behalf of the contractor,
and cannot be employed in any capacity as a plumber for any other contractor. An individual may
be the responsible licensed plumber for only one contractor.

condition of licensing, each contractor shall give and maintain bond to the state in the amount of at
least $25,000 for (1) all plumbing work entered into within the state or (2) all plumbing work and
subsurface sewage treatment work entered into within the state. If the bond is for both plumbing
work and subsurface sewage treatment work, the bond must comply with the requirements of this
section and section 115.56, subdivision 2, paragraph (e). The bond shall be for the benefit of persons
injured or suffering financial loss by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of the State
Plumbing Code and, if the bond is for both plumbing work and subsurface sewage treatment work,
financial loss by reason of failure to comply with the requirements of sections 115.55 and 115.56.
The bond shall be filed with the commissioner and shall be written by a corporate surety licensed

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2012.
     Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.47, is amended to read:
     326B.47 PLUMBER'S APPRENTICES.
    Subdivision 1. Registration; supervision; records. (a) All plumber's apprentices must be
registered. To be a registered plumber's apprentice, an individual must either:
   (1) be an individual employed in the trade of plumbing under an apprenticeship agreement
approved by the department under Minnesota Rules, part 5200.0300; or
     (2) be an unlicensed individual registered with the commissioner under subdivision 3.
    (b) A plumber's apprentice is authorized to assist in the installation of plumbing only while
under the direct supervision of a master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted journeyman
plumber. The master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted journeyman plumber is
responsible for ensuring that all plumbing work performed by the plumber's apprentice complies
with the plumbing code. The supervising master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted
journeyman must be licensed and must be employed by the same employer as the plumber's
apprentice. Licensed individuals shall not permit plumber's apprentices to perform plumbing
work except under the direct supervision of an individual actually licensed to perform such work.
Plumber's apprentices shall not supervise the performance of plumbing work or make assignments
of plumbing work to unlicensed individuals.
    (c) Contractors employing plumber's apprentices to perform plumbing work shall maintain
records establishing compliance with this subdivision that shall identify all plumber's apprentices
performing plumbing work, and shall permit the department to examine and copy all such records.
    Subd. 2. Journeyman exam. A plumber's apprentice who has completed four years of practical
plumbing experience is eligible to take the journeyman plumbing examination. Up to 24 months
of practical plumbing experience prior to becoming a plumber's apprentice may be applied to the
four-year experience requirement. However, none of this practical plumbing experience may be
applied if the individual did not have any practical plumbing experience in the 12-month period
immediately prior to becoming a plumber's apprentice. The Plumbing Board may adopt rules to
evaluate whether the individual's past practical plumbing experience is applicable in preparing for
the journeyman's examination. If two years after completing the training the individual has not taken
the examination, the four years of experience shall be forfeited.
    The commissioner may allow an extension of the two-year period for taking the exam for cases
of hardship or other appropriate circumstances.
     Subd. 3. Registration, rules, applications, renewals, and fees. An unlicensed individual
may register by completing and submitting to the commissioner                           a

engage in the plumbing trade in all areas of the state except in cities and towns with a population of
more than 5,000 according to the last federal census.

journeyman plumber license must be renewed for as long as that licensee engages in the plumbing
trade. Notwithstanding section 326B.094, failure to renew a restricted master plumber and

13, if enacted, is amended to read:
   326B.55 LICENSING IN CERTAIN CITIES; QUALIFICATIONS; RULES.
    Subdivision 1. Licensing. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d), no individual shall perform
water conditioning installation or water conditioning servicing unless licensed by the commissioner
as a master plumber, journeyman plumber, water conditioning master, or water conditioning
journeyman, or, in all areas of the state except in cities and towns with a population of more than
5,000 according to the last federal census, as a restricted master plumber or restricted journeyman
plumber.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (d), no person shall perform or offer to perform water
conditioning installation or water conditioning servicing with or without compensation unless
the person obtains a water conditioning contractor's license. A water conditioning contractor's
license does not of itself qualify its holder to perform the water conditioning installation or water
conditioning servicing authorized by holding a water conditioning master or water conditioning
journeyman license.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d), no person shall engage in or work at the business of
water conditioning installation or servicing anywhere in the state unless

sole proprietorship, the responsible licensed master must be the individual, proprietor, or managing
employee. If the water conditioning contractor is a partnership, the responsible licensed master must
be a general partner or managing employee. If the water conditioning contractor is a limited liability
company, the responsible licensed master must be a chief manager or managing employee. If the

    Subd. 4. Plumber's apprentices. (a) A plumber's apprentice who is registered under section
326B.47 is authorized to assist in water conditioning installation and water conditioning servicing
only while under the direct supervision of a master plumber, journeyman plumber, water
conditioning master, or water conditioning journeyman. The master or journeyman is responsible
for ensuring that all water conditioning work performed by the plumber's apprentice complies
with the plumbing code and rules adopted under sections 326B.50 to 326B.59. The supervising
master or journeyman must be licensed and must be employed by the same employer as the
plumber's apprentice. Licensed individuals shall not permit plumber's apprentices to perform water
conditioning work except under the direct supervision of an individual actually licensed to perform
such work. Plumber's apprentices shall not supervise the performance of plumbing work or make
assignments of plumbing work to unlicensed individuals.
   (b) Water conditioning contractors employing plumber's apprentices to perform water
conditioning work shall maintain records establishing compliance with this subdivision that
shall identify all plumber's apprentices performing water conditioning work, and shall permit the
department to examine and copy all such records.

      Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.805, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
      Subd. 6. Exemptions. The license requirement does not apply to:
      (1) an employee of a licensee performing work for the licensee;
   (2) a material person, manufacturer, or retailer furnishing finished products, materials, or articles
of merchandise who does not install or attach the items;
     (3) an owner of residential real estate who builds or improves any structure on residential
real estate, if the building or improving is performed by the owner's bona fide employees or by
individual owners personally. This exemption does not apply to an owner who constructs or
improves property for purposes of speculation if the building or improving is performed by the
owner's bona fide employees or by individual owners personally. A residential building contractor
or residential remodeler will be presumed to be building or improving for purposes of speculation
if the contractor or remodeler constructs or improves more than one property within any 24-month
period;
   (4) an architect or professional engineer engaging in professional practice as defined by section
326.02, subdivisions 2 and 3;
  (5) a person whose total gross annual receipts for performing specialty skills for which licensure
would be required under this section do not exceed $15,000;
      (6) a mechanical contractor;
    (7) a plumber, electrician, or other person whose profession is otherwise subject to statewide
licensing, when engaged in the activity which is the subject of that licensure;
      (8) specialty contractors who provide only one special skill as defined in section 326B.802;

     (9) a school district, or a technical college governed under chapter 136F; and
   (10) Habitat for Humanity and Builders Outreach Foundation, and their individual volunteers
when engaged in activities on their behalf.
To qualify for the exemption in clause (5), a person must obtain a certificate of exemption from
licensure from the commissioner. A certificate of exemption will be issued upon the applicant's filing
with the commissioner, an affidavit stating that the applicant does not expect to exceed $15,000 in
gross annual receipts derived from performing services which require licensure under this section
during the calendar year in which the affidavit is received. For the purposes of calculating fees under
section 326B.092, a certificate of exemption is an entry level license. To renew the exemption in
clause (5), the applicant must file an affidavit stating that the applicant did not exceed $15,000 in
gross annual receipts during the past calendar year. If a person, operating under the exemption in
clause (5), exceeds $15,000 in gross receipts during any calendar year, the person must immediately
surrender the ex

                        n certificate of exemption and apply for the appropriate license. The person
must remain licensed until such time as the person's gross annual receipts during a calendar year
fall below $15,000. The person may then apply for an exemption for the next calendar year.

It is recommended that the single-section used manufactured home being reinstalled follow the
instructions in the manufacturer's installation manual. By signing this notice, the purchaser(s) are
acknowledging they have elected to use footings placed above the local frost line in accordance with
the Minnesota State Building Code.
The seller has explained the differences between the manufacturer's installation instructions and
the installation system selected by the purchaser(s) with respect to possible effects of frost on the
manufactured home.
The purchaser(s) acknowledge by signing this notice that there is no manufacturer's original
warranty remaining on the home and recognize that any other extended or ancillary warranty could
be adversely affected if any applicable warranty stipulates that the home be installed in accordance
with the manufacturer's installation manual to remain effective.
After the reinstallation of the manufactured home, it is highly recommended that the purchaser(s)
have a licensed manufactured home installer recheck the home's installation for any releveling needs
or anchoring system adjustments each freeze-thaw cycle.
The purchaser(s) of the used manufactured home described below that is being reinstalled
acknowledge they have read this notice and have been advised to contact the manufacturer of the
home and/or the Department of Labor and Industry if they desire additional information before
signing this notice. It is the intent of this notice to inform the purchaser(s) that the purchaser(s)
elected not to use a frost-protected foundation system for the reinstallation of the manufactured
home as originally required by the home's installation manual.
     Plain language notice.
    I understand that because this home will be installed with footings placed above the local frost
line, this home may be subject to adverse effects from frost heave that may damage this home.

more than ten sales during each year of the two-year licensure period. An owner may, upon payment
of the applicable fee and compliance with this subdivision, obtain a separate license for each owned
manufactured home park and is entitled to sell up to 20 homes per license period provided that only
one limited dealer license may be issued for each park. The license shall be issued after:
    (1) receipt of an application on forms provided by the commissioner containing the following
information:
     (i) the identity of the applicant;

   (ii) the name under which the applicant will be licensed and do business in this state;
    (iii) the name and address of the owned manufactured home park, including a copy of the park
license, serving as the basis for the issuance of the license;
   (iv) the name, home, and business address of the applicant;
    (v) the name, address, and telephone number of one individual that is designated by the
applicant to receive all communications and cooperate with all inspections and investigations of
the commissioner pertaining to the sale of manufactured homes in the manufactured home park
owned by the applicant;
    (vi) whether the applicant or its designated individual has been convicted of a crime within the
previous ten years that is either related directly to the business for which the license is sought or
involved fraud, misrepresentation or misuse of funds, or has suffered a judgment in a civil action
involving fraud, misrepresentation, or conversion within the previous five years or has had any
government license or permit suspended or revoked as a result of an action brought by a federal or
state governmental agency in this or any other state within the last five years; and
   (vii) the applicant's qualifications and business history, including whether the applicant or its
designated individual has ever been adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or has any unsatisfied court
judgments outstanding against it or them;
   (2) payment of the license fee established by subdivision 7a; and
    (3) provision of a surety bond in the amount of $5,000. A separate surety bond must be provided
for each limited license.
    The applicant need not comply with section 327B.04, subdivision 4, paragraph (e). The
holding of a limited dealer's license does not satisfy the requirement contained in section 327B.04,
subdivision 4, paragraph (e), for the licensee or salespersons with respect to obtaining a dealer

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 58.08, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Residential mortgage originators. (a) An applicant for a residential mortgage
originator license must file with the department a surety bond in the amount of $100,000, issued
by an insurance company authorized to do so in this state. The bond must cover all mortgage loan
originators who are employees or independent agents of the applicant. The bond must be available
for the recovery of expenses, fines, and fees levied by the commissioner under this chapter and for
losses incurred by borrowers as a result of a licensee's noncompliance with the requirements of
this chapter, sections 325D.43 to 325D.48, and 325F.67 to 325F.69, or breach of contract relating
to activities regulated by this chapter.
   (b) The bond must be submitted with the originator's license application and evidence of
continued coverage must be submitted with each renewal. Any change in the bond must be
submitted for approval by the commissioner, within ten days of its execution. The bond or a
substitute bond shall remain in effect during all periods of licensing.
     (c) Upon filing of the mortgage call report as required by section 58A.17, a licensee shall
maintain or increase its surety bond to reflect the total dollar amount of the closed residential
mortgage loans originated in this state in the preceding year in accordance with the table in this
paragraph. A licensee may decrease its surety bond in accordance with the table in this paragraph
if the surety bond required is less than the amount of the surety bond on file with the department.

the area in which the additional franchise is being sought is not actually being served by any existing
cable communications system holding a franchise for the area. Nothing in this paragraph prevents
a municipality from imposing additional terms and conditions on any additional franchises.

    Subd. 2. Responsibilities. (a) In addition to other activities prescribed by law, the office shall
carry out the duties set out in this subdivision.
    (b) The office shall develop and establish a state information architecture to ensure:
   (1) that state agency development and purchase of information and communications systems,
equipment, and services is designed to ensure that individual agency information systems
complement and do not needlessly duplicate or conflict with the systems of other agencies; and
   (2) that enhanced access to data can be provided to the public in accordance with the policy
developed under section 16E.05, subdivision 4.
When state agencies have need for the same or similar public data, the chief information officer, in
coordination with the affected agencies, shall manage the most efficient and cost-effective method
of producing and storing data for or sharing data between those agencies. The development of this
information architecture must include the establishment of standards and guidelines to be followed
by state agencies. The office shall ensure compliance with the architecture.
    (c) The office shall assist state agencies in the planning and management of information
systems so that an individual information system reflects and supports the state agency's mission
and the state's requirements and functions. The office shall review and approve agency technology
plans to ensure consistency with enterprise information and telecommunications technology

strategy. By January 15 of each year, the chief information officer must report to the chairs and the
ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction over the
office regarding the assistance provided under this paragraph. The report must include a listing of
agencies that have developed or are developing plans under this paragraph.

purchase of information systems equipment or software before the requests may be included in the
governor's budget.
   (e) The office shall review major purchases of information systems equipment to:
   (1) ensure that the equipment follows the standards and guidelines of the state information
architecture;
   (2) ensure the agency's proposed purchase reflects a cost-effective policy regarding volume
purchasing; and
    (3) ensure that the equipment is consistent with other systems in other state agencies so that
data can be shared among agencies, unless the office determines that the agency purchasing the
equipment has special needs justifying the inconsistency.
    (f) The office shall review the operation of information systems by state agencies and ensure
that these systems are operated efficiently and securely and continually meet the standards and
guidelines established by the office. The standards and guidelines must emphasize uniformity
that is cost-effective for the enterprise, that encourages information interchange, open systems
environments, and portability of information whenever practicable and consistent with an agency's
authority and chapter 13.
    (g) The office shall conduct a comprehensive review at least every three years of the information
systems investments that have been made by state agencies and higher education institutions. The
review must include recommendations on any information systems applications that could be
provided in a more cost-beneficial manner by an outside source. The office must report the results
of its review to the legislature and the governor.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16E.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Policy for transparency. The chief information officer shall develop a policy to
enhance public access to electronic data maintained by state government, consistent with the
requirements of chapter 13. The policy must ensure that:

   (b) A federated funding organization must apply in the form prescribed by the commissioner
and shall provide the following:
   (1) assurance of tax exempt status for the federated funding organization and each of the
charitable agencies identified by the federated funding organization as an affiliated agency;
   (2) assurance of proper registration with the attorney general of Minnesota to solicit
contributions in the state of Minnesota for the federated funding organization and each of the
charitable agencies identified by the federated funding organization as an affiliated agency. A
copy of the registration letter in effect at the time of application for the state employee combined
charities campaign must be available upon request;
    (3) an affidavit signed by a duly constituted officer of the federated funding organization attesting
to the fact that the federated funding organization and its affiliated agencies are in compliance with
each of the provisions of this section;
   (4) a list of the board of directors or local advisory board for the federated funding organization
which identifies the members who live or work in Minnesota and contiguous counties;

programs, and designated agencies it supports; and
   (8) a fee of $100, or ten percent of the funds raised from state employees in the previous
campaign, whichever is less. The fee for an organization which did not participate in the previous
year's state employee campaign is $100. These fees must be credited to an account in the special
revenue fund and are appropriated to the commissioner to be expended with the approval of the
Combined Charities Board in section 43A.04 for costs associated with administering the annual
campaign.
   The commissioner may require submission of additional information needed to determine
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
    (c) The commissioner shall register or not register the application of an organization and shall
notify the organization of the decision by May 1. An organization whose application is denied has
ten calendar days after receiving notice of the denial to appeal the decision or file an amended
application correcting the deficiency. The commissioner shall register or not register the organization
within ten calendar days after receiving the appeal or amended application. If registration is denied
a second time, the organization may appeal within five calendar days after receiving notice of the
denial. A hearing shall be scheduled by the commissioner and shall be held within 15 calendar days
after receiving notice of the appeal. The parties may mutually agree to a later date. The provisions
of chapter 14 do not apply to the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in a manner considered
appropriate by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination within five calendar
days after the hearing has been completed.

    Subdivision 1. Conditions requiring membership. The nonprofit association known as the
Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Association may be incorporated under chapter 317A with
all the powers of a corporation formed under that chapter, except that if the provisions of that
chapter are inconsistent with sections 79.34 to 79.40, sections 79.34 to 79.40 govern. Each insurer

compensation insurance in this state, be a member of the reinsurance association and is bound by the
plan of operation of the reinsurance association; provided, that all affiliated insurers within a holding

    (2) all group self-insurers granted authority to self-insure pursuant to section 176.181 are
considered single entities for purposes of the exercise of all the rights and duties of membership in

     Subdivision 1. Definition. The term "declaration of trust" as used in this section means the
declaration of trust, business trust instrument, trust indenture, contract of custodianship, or other

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 557.01, is amended to read:
    557.01 NONRESIDENT, AGENT TO ACCEPT SERVICE.
     Any nonresident person or corporation owning or claiming any interest or lien in or upon lands
in the state may file with the secretary of state a writing, executed and acknowledged in the manner
of a conveyance, appointing a resident agent, whose place of residence shall be stated, to accept
service of process or summons in any action or proceeding in the courts of the state concerning
such interest or lien, except actions or proceedings for the collection of taxes, and consenting that
service of such process or summons upon such agent shall be binding upon the person executing the
same. Such writing shall be recorded by the secretary. No service by publication of summons shall
be made upon any such nonresident who has complied with the provisions hereof, but in all such
cases service of such process or summons, or of any writ or notice in the action or proceedings,
shall be made upon such agent in the manner provided by law for such service upon residents
of the state, and have the same effect as personal service within the state upon such owner or
claimant; but, if such party appears by attorneys therein, the service of papers shall thereafter be
upon such attorney. The authority of such agent may be revoked by writing similarly executed and
acknowledged and recorded, but no revocation shall affect any action or proceeding then pending.

    By January 15, 2011, the chief information officer shall report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over the Office of Enterprise Technology
regarding the development of the policy to enhance public access to data required under Minnesota
Statutes, section 16E.05, subdivision 4. The report must describe the process for developing the
policy, including the opportunity provided for public comment, and specify the components of the
policy that have been implemented, including a description of the level of public use of the new
opportunities for data access under the policy.
  Sec. 11. APPROPRIATION;                    ASSISTIVE         VOTING        EQUIPMENT           AND
VOTE-COUNTING EQUIPMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Operating grants. $300,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2010 from the Help
America Vote Act account to the secretary of state for grants to counties to defray operating
costs of the assistive voting equipment and vote-counting equipment in each polling place. This
appropriation is available until spent. Grants of up to $300 per polling place may be made until this
appropriation is exhausted. If the grant requests exceed the appropriation available, the secretary
of state shall prorate the grant amounts to each eligible county to match the amount available.
    Subd. 2. Grant application. To receive a grant under this subdivision, a county must apply to
the secretary of state on forms prescribed by the secretary of state that set forth how the grant money
will be spent. Grant applications for operating costs for the 2010 elections must be received by the
secretary of state by August 1, 2010. Grant awards must be made to the counties by December 1,
2010. If money remains from this appropriation, the secretary may also make grants available for
