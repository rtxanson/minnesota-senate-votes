    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a, is amended
to read:
    Subd. 3a. Assessment and support planning. (a) Persons requesting assessment, services
planning, or other assistance intended to support community-based living, including persons who
need assessment in order to determine waiver or alternative care program eligibility, must be
visited by a long-term care consultation team within 15 calendar days after the date on which an
assessment was requested or recommended. After January 1, 2011, these requirements also apply
to personal care assistance services, private duty nursing, and home health agency services, on
timelines established in subdivision 5. Face-to-face assessments must be conducted according to
paragraphs (b) to (i).
    (b) The county may utilize a team of either the social worker or public health nurse, or both.
After January 1, 2011, lead agencies shall use certified assessors to conduct the assessment in a
face-to-face interview. The consultation team members must confer regarding the most appropriate
care for each individual screened or assessed.
    (c) The assessment must be comprehensive and include a person-centered assessment of the
health, psychological, functional, environmental, and social needs of referred individuals and
provide information necessary to develop a support plan that meets the consumers needs, using an
assessment form provided by the commissioner.
    (d) The assessment must be conducted in a face-to-face interview with the person being

individuals as requested by the person, who can provide information on the needs, strengths, and
preferences of the person necessary to develop a support plan that ensures the person's health and
safety, but who is not a provider of service or has any financial interest in the provision of services.
    (e) The person, or the person's legal representative, must be provided with written
recommendations for community-based services, including consumer directed options, or
institutional care that include documentation that the most cost-effective alternatives available
were offered to the individual. For purposes of this requirement, "cost-effective alternatives" means
community services and living arrangements that cost the same as or less than institutional care.
    (f) If the person chooses to use community-based services, the person or the person's legal
representative must be provided with a written community support plan, regardless of whether
the individual is eligible for Minnesota health care programs. A person may request assistance in
identifying community supports without participating in a complete assessment. Upon a request for
assistance identifying community support, the person must be transferred or referred to the services
available under sections 256.975, subdivision 7, and 256.01, subdivision 24, for telephone assistance
and follow up.
   (g) The person has the right to make the final decision between institutional placement and
community placement after the recommendations have been provided, except as provided in
subdivision 4a, paragraph (c).
    (h) The team must give the person receiving assessment or support planning, or the person's
legal representative, materials, and forms supplied by the commissioner containing the following
information:
    (1) the need for and purpose of preadmission screening if the person selects nursing facility
placement;
    (2) the role of the long-term care consultation assessment and support planning in waiver and
alternative care program eligibility determination;
   (3) information about Minnesota health care programs;
   (4) the person's freedom to accept or reject the recommendations of the team;
   (5) the person's right to confidentiality under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act,
chapter 13;
    (6) the long-term care consultant's decision regarding the person's need for institutional level of
care as determined under criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, or 256B.092; and
    (7) the person's right to appeal the decision regarding the need for nursing facility level of care
or the county's final decisions regarding public programs eligibility according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3.
    (i) Face-to-face assessment completed as part of eligibility determination for the alternative care,
elderly waiver, community alternatives for disabled individuals, community alternative care, and
traumatic brain injury waiver programs under sections 256B.0915, 256B.0917, and 256B.49 is valid
to establish service eligibility for no more than 60 calendar days after the date of assessment. The
effective eligibility start date for these programs can never be prior to the date of assessment. If an

assessment was completed more than 60 days before the effective waiver or alternative care program
eligibility start date, assessment and support plan information must be updated in a face-to-face
visit and documented in the department's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). The
effective date of program eligibility in this case cannot be prior to the date the updated assessment
is completed.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 4d, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4d. Preadmission screening of individuals under 65 years of age. (a) It is the policy
of the state of Minnesota to ensure that individuals with disabilities or chronic illness are served in
the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and have the necessary information to make
informed choices about home and community-based service options.
    (b) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to a nursing facility from a hospital must
be screened prior to admission as outlined in subdivisions 4a through 4c.
    (c) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to nursing facilities with only a telephone
screening must receive a face-to-face assessment from the long-term care consultation team member
of the county in which the facility is located or from the recipient's county case manager within 40
calendar days of admission.
    (d) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to a nursing facility without preadmission
screening according to the exemption described in subdivision 4b, paragraph (a), clause (3), and who
remain in the facility longer than 30 days must receive a face-to-face assessment within 40 days of
admission.
  (e) At the face-to-face assessment, the long-term care consultation team member or county case
manager must perform the activities required under subdivision 3b.
    (f) For individuals under 21 years of age, a screening interview which recommends nursing
facility admission must be face-to-face and approved by the commissioner before the individual is
admitted to the nursing facility.
    (g) In the event that an individual under 65 years of age is admitted to a nursing facility on
an emergency basis, the county must be notified of the admission on the next working day, and a
face-to-face assessment as described in paragraph (c) must be conducted within 40 calendar days
of admission.
    (h) At the face-to-face assessment, the long-term care consultation team member or the case
manager must present information about home and community-based options, including consumer
directed options, so the individual can make informed choices. If the individual chooses home and
community-based services, the long-term care consultation team member or case manager must
complete a written relocation plan within 20 working days of the visit. The plan shall describe the
services needed to move out of the facility and a time line for the move which is designed to ensure
a smooth transition to the individual's home and community.
    (i) An individual under 65 years of age residing in a nursing facility shall receive a face-to-face
assessment at least every 12 months to review the person's service choices and available alternatives
unless the individual indicates, in writing, that annual visits are not desired. In this case, the
individual must receive a face-to-face assessment at least once every 36 months for the same
purposes.

    (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 6, the commissioner may pay county agencies
directly for face-to-face assessments for individuals under 65 years of age who are being considered
for placement or residing in a nursing facility.

and providing services through the consumer directed community supports option during the
identification of data to be used in future development of an individualized budget methodology
for the home and community-based waivers under the new comprehensive assessment."

    Subd. 7. Considerations in designating sites and routes. (a) The commission's site and
route permit determinations must be guided by the state's goals to conserve resources, minimize
environmental impacts, minimize human settlement and other land use conflicts, and ensure
the state's electric energy security through efficient, cost-effective power supply and electric
transmission infrastructure.
   (b) To facilitate the study, research, evaluation, and designation of sites and routes, the
commission shall be guided by, but not limited to, the following considerations:
    (1) evaluation of research and investigations relating to the effects on land, water and air
resources of large electric power generating plants and high-voltage transmission lines and the
effects of water and air discharges and electric and magnetic fields resulting from such facilities on

public health and welfare, vegetation, animals, materials and aesthetic values, including baseline
studies, predictive modeling, and evaluation of new or improved methods for minimizing adverse
impacts of water and air discharges and other matters pertaining to the effects of power plants on
the water and air environment;
   (2) environmental evaluation of sites and routes proposed for future development and expansion
and their relationship to the land, water, air and human resources of the state;
    (3) evaluation of the effects of new electric power generation and transmission technologies and
systems related to power plants designed to minimize adverse environmental effects;
   (4) evaluation of the potential for beneficial uses of waste energy from proposed large electric
power generating plants;
    (5) analysis of the direct and indirect economic impact of proposed sites and routes including,
but not limited to, productive agricultural land lost or impaired;
    (6) evaluation of adverse direct and indirect environmental effects that cannot be avoided should
the proposed site and route be accepted;
   (7) evaluation of alternatives to the applicant's proposed site or route proposed pursuant to
subdivisions 1 and 2;
    (8) evaluation of potential routes that would use or parallel existing railroad and highway
rights-of-way;
    (9) evaluation of governmental survey lines and other natural division lines of agricultural land
so as to minimize interference with agricultural operations;
   (10) evaluation of the future needs for additional high-voltage transmission lines in the same
general area as any proposed route, and the advisability of ordering the construction of structures
capable of expansion in transmission capacity through multiple circuiting or design modifications;
    (11) evaluation of irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources should the proposed
site or route be approved; and
    (12) when appropriate, consideration of problems raised by other state and federal agencies and
local entities.
    (c) If the commission's rules are substantially similar to existing regulations of a federal agency
to which the utility in the state is subject, the federal regulations must be applied by the commission.
   (d) No site or route shall be designated which violates state agency rules.
    (e) The commission must make specific findings that it has considered locating a route for a
high-voltage transmission line on an existing high-voltage transmission route and the use of parallel
existing highway right-of-way and, to the extent those are not used for the route, the commission
must state the reasons.

   Senator Dahle moved to amend S.F. No. 2971 as follows:
   Page 2, before line 1, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 117.189, is amended to read:

and 117.52, subdivisions 1a and 4, do not apply to the use of eminent domain authority by public
service corporations for any purpose other than construction or expansion of:
   (1) a high-voltage transmission line of 100 kilovolts or more, or ancillary substations; or
   (2) a natural gas, petroleum, or petroleum products pipeline, or ancillary compressor stations or
pumping stations.
   For purposes of an award of appraisal fees under section 117.085, the fees awarded may not
exceed $1,500 for all types of property except for a public service corporation's use of eminent
domain for a high-voltage transmission line, where the award may not exceed $3,000.
    For purposes of this section, "pipeline" does not include a natural gas distribution line

   "Sec. 2. [237.681] PRIVATE SHARED SERVICES.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) "private shared services" means the provision of telephone services and equipment,
the provision of video programming services, or the provision of broadband services within a
user group located in discrete private premises, in building complexes, campuses, or high-rise
buildings, by a commercial shared services provider or by a user association, through privately
owned customer premises equipment and associated data processing and information management
services and includes the provision of connections to the facilities of a local exchange and to
long-distance telephone companies; and
    (2) "property owner" means a person who owns or, under a contract with the owner, manages a
building, property, complex, or other facility where private shared services are provided.
    Subd. 2. Requirements. A property owner shall establish a single demarcation point for services
and facilities provided by a telephone company providing local exchange service in the area that is
mutually agreeable to the property owner, commercial shared services provider, and the telephone
company. The obligation of a telephone company to provide service to a customer at a location
where private shared services are operating is limited to providing telephone company service and
facilities up to the demarcation point established for the property where the private shared services
are operating. The property owner may not (1) impose unreasonable restrictions on access to the
demarcation point on the premises by a telephone company or (2) discriminate against or in favor of
an occupant in any manner, including charging the occupant higher or lower rental charges, because
of the occupant's choice of telephone company.
    Subd. 3. Access to alternative provider. A tenant of a building, property, complex, or other
facility where private shared services are operating may establish a direct connection to and receive
telephone service from a telephone company providing local exchange service in the area where
the private shared services are operating. At the request of a tenant where a private shared system
is operated, the property owner shall make its facilities or conduit space available to the tenant
to allow the tenant to make separate connection to and to receive telephone service directly from
the telephone company operating local exchange service in the area. The tenant has the choice of
installing the tenant's own facilities or using the property owner's existing facilities. The property
owner must provide its facilities or conduit space to the tenant at a reasonable rate and on reasonable
terms and conditions. It is the obligation of the tenant to arrange for premises wire, cable, or other
equipment necessary to connect the tenant's telephone equipment with the facilities of the telephone
company operating local exchange service at the location of the demarcation point.
    Subd. 4. Enforcement. If the commission finds that a property owner has failed to comply with
a request under this section, the commission may order the property owner to make its facilities or
conduit space available sufficient to allow the tenant to make separate connection with the telephone
company, and provide the services at reasonable prices and on reasonable terms and conditions.
    Subd. 5. Exemption. A commercial shared services provider is exempt from section 237.16 if
the private shared services are only provided to tenants or for the provider's own use.
    Subd. 6. Service by local telephone company. A telephone company providing local exchange
service shall provide service to any person in a property served by a commercial shared services
provider at the demarcation point within a reasonable time upon request.

    Subd. 7. Obligation of property owners. Nothing in this section requires a commercial shared
services provider to share its wiring, cabling, or other facilities unless the commercial shared
services provider is the property owner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
   Senator Dibble moved to amend S.F. No. 2616 as follows:
   Page 3, after line 6, insert:
   "Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 238.08, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirement; conditions. (a) A municipality shall require a franchise or
extension permit of any cable communications system providing service within the municipality.
    (b) No municipality shall grant an additional franchise for cable service for an area included
in an existing franchise on terms and conditions more favorable or less burdensome than those in
the existing franchise pertaining to: (1) the area served; (2) public, educational, or governmental
access requirements; or (3) franchise fees. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply when
the area in which the additional franchise is being sought is not actually being served by any existing
cable communications system holding a franchise for the area. Nothing in this paragraph prevents
a municipality from imposing additional terms and conditions on any additional franchises.
    (c) An area for an additional cable franchise is not more favorable or less burdensome if the
franchisee is a telephone company, as defined in section 237.01, subdivision 7, and the area of the
franchise is no less than the area within the municipality in which the telephone company offers
local exchange telephone service. This paragraph is in addition to and not a limit to the authority of
a municipality to grant an additional franchise for cable service.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and does not affect any litigation
pending on that date."
