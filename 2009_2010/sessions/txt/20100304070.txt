    Subd. 10. Court review of foster care. (a) If the court orders a child placed in foster care,
the court shall review the out-of-home placement at least every 90 days as required in juvenile
court rules to determine whether continued out-of-home placement is necessary and appropriate or
whether the child should be returned home. This review is not required if the court has returned the
child home, ordered the child permanently placed away from the parent under subdivision 11, or
terminated rights under section 260C.301. Court review for a child permanently placed away from
a parent, including where the child is under guardianship and legal custody of the commissioner,
shall be governed by subdivision 11 or section 260C.317, subdivision 3, whichever is applicable.
   (b) No later than six months after the child's placement in foster care, the court shall review
agency efforts pursuant to section 260C.212, subdivision 2, and order that the efforts continue if the
agency has failed to perform the duties under that section.
   (c) The court shall review the out-of-home placement plan and may modify the plan as provided
under subdivisions 6 and 7.
    (d) When the court orders transfer of custody to a responsible social services agency resulting in

foster care or protective supervision with a noncustodial parent under subdivision 1, the court shall
notify the parents of the provisions of subdivisions 11 and 11a as required under juvenile court rules.
    (e) When a child remains in foster care pursuant to section 260C.451 and the court has
jurisdiction pursuant to section 260C.193, subdivision 6, paragraph (c), the court shall annually
conduct the review required under subdivision 11, paragraph (d), or sections 260C.212, subdivision
7, and 260C.317, subdivision 3."

prior to the child's 18th birthday, the local agency shall advise any child in foster care under this
chapter, the child's parents or legal guardian, if any, and the child's foster parents of the availability
of benefits of the foster care program up to age 21.
    Subd. 2. Independent living plan. Upon the request of any child receiving foster care benefits
immediately prior to the child's 18th birthday and who is in foster care at the time of the request,
the local agency shall, in conjunction with the child and other appropriate parties, update the
independent living plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), clause
(11), related to the child's employment, vocational, educational, social, or maturational needs. The
agency shall provide continued services and foster care for the child including those services that
are necessary to implement the independent living plan.
    Subd. 3. Eligibility. A child already in foster care may continue in foster care past age 18. The
child must meet at least one of the following conditions to be considered eligible to continue in
foster care to age 21. The child must be:
     (1) completing secondary education or a program leading to an equivalent credential;
     (2) enrolled in an institution which provides postsecondary or vocational education;
     (3) participating in a program or activity designed to promote or remove barriers to employment;
     (4) employed for at least 80 hours per month; or
   (5) incapable of doing any of the activities described in clauses (1) to (4) due to a medical
condition.
    Subd. 4. Foster care benefits. For children between the ages of 18 and 21, "foster care

live independently.
    Subd. 5. Permanent decision. The particular foster care setting, including supervised settings,
shall be selected based on the best interest of the child consistent with section 260C.212, subdivision
2. Supervision in approved settings must be determined by an individual determination of the child's
needs by the responsible social services agency and consistent with section 260C.212, subdivision
4a.
    Subd. 6. Individual plan to age 21. Upon request of an individual between the ages of 18 and
21 who, within six months of the individual's 18th birthday, had been under the guardianship of
the commissioner and who has left foster care, the responsible social services agency which had
been the commissioner's agent for purposes of the guardianship shall develop with the individual
a plan related to the individual's vocational, educational, social, or maturational needs. The agency
shall provide foster care with maintenance and counseling benefits as required to implement the
plan. The agency shall enter into a voluntary placement agreement with the individual if the plan
includes foster care.
    Subd. 7. Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that the court retains jurisdiction pursuant to this section,
individuals in foster care pursuant to this section are adults for all purposes except the continued
provision of foster care. Any order establishing guardianship under section 260C.325, any legal
custody order under section 260C.201, subdivision 1, and any order for legal custody associated
with an order for long-term foster care under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, terminates on the
child's 18th birthday."

    "A parent with a legally recognized parent and child relationship must be provided the right to
be heard in any review or hearing held with respect to the child, which includes the right to be heard
on the disposition order under section 260C.201, subdivision 1, parental visitation under section
260C.178, and the out-of-home placement plan under section 260C.212, subdivision 1. The right
to be heard does not automatically confer party status. Party status is governed by the Minnesota
Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure."

to 169.829, an additional cost added to the fees listed above. However, this paragraph applies to
any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when the vehicle
exceeds its gross weight allowance set forth in that paragraph, and then the additional cost is for
all weight, including the allowance weight, in excess of the permitted maximum axle weight. The
