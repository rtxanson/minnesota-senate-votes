The Technical Review Committee shall reject any nonresponsive proposal. The municipality shall
review the technical proposal scores.
   (b) The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall review the technical proposal scores.
The commissioner shall submit the final technical proposal scores to the municipality.
    (c) The municipality shall announce the technical proposal score for each design-builder and
shall publicly open the sealed price proposals and shall divide each design-builder's price by the
technical score that the commissioner has given to it to obtain an adjusted score. The design-builder
selected must be that responsive and responsible design-builder whose adjusted score is the lowest.
  (d) If a time factor is included with the selection criteria in the RFP package, the municipality
may use a value of the time factor established by the municipality as a criterion in the RFP.
    (e) Unless all proposals are rejected, the municipality shall award the contract to the responsive
and responsible design-builder with the lowest adjusted score. The municipality shall reserve the
right to reject all proposals.
    (f) The municipality shall award a stipulated fee not less than two-tenths of one percent of
the municipality's estimated cost of design and construction to each short-listed, responsible
proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal. If the municipality does not award
a contract, all short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the municipality cancels the
contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the municipality shall award each design-builder
on the short list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the municipality's
estimated cost of design and construction. The municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to each
proposer within 90 days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract.
In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the municipality may use any ideas or information
contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project or in connection
with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the
unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, an unsuccessful
short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short-list proposer
elects to waive the stipulated fee, the municipality may not use ideas and information contained in
that proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the municipality, a proposer who waived a stipulated
fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to the
proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the proposer's proposal.

    Subd. 10. Low-bid design-build process. (a) The municipality may also use low-bid,
design-build procedures to award a design-build contract where the scope of the work can be
clearly defined.
   (b) Low-bid design-build projects may require an RFQ and short-listing, and must require an
RFP.
    (c) Submitted proposals under this subdivision must include separately a technical proposal and
a price proposal. The low-bid, design-build procedures must follow a two-step process for review
of the responses to the RFP as follows:
   (1) the first step is the review of the technical proposal by the Technical Review Committee as
provided in subdivision 4. The Technical Review Committee must open the technical proposal first
and must determine if it complies with the requirements of the RFP and is responsive. The Technical
Review Committee may not perform any ranking or scoring of the technical proposals; and
  (2) the second step is the determination of the low bidder based on the price proposal. The
municipality may not open the price proposal until the review of the technical proposal is complete.
  (d) The contract award under low-bid, design-build procedures must be made to the proposer
whose sealed bid is responsive to the technical requirements as determined by the Technical Review
Committee and that is also the lowest bid.
   (e) A stipulated fee may be paid for unsuccessful bids on low-bid, design-build projects only
when the municipality has required an RFQ and short-listed the most highly qualified responsive
bidders.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and expires
on October 1, 2012, or upon completion of nine design-build projects under this pilot program,
whichever occurs first.
   Sec. 27. REPORT TO LEGISLATURE.
    Annually, by January 15, the council shall submit a report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over transportation budget and policy, and
to the legislature as provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 15.059. The report must summarize
the design-build pilot program selection process, including the number of applications considered;
the proposal process for each project that was selected; the contracting process for each project that
was completed; and project costs. The report must evaluate the process and results applying the
performance-based measures with which the commissioner evaluates trunk highway design-build
projects. The report must include any recommendations for future legislation.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and expires
on October 1, 2012, or upon completion of nine design-build projects under this pilot program,
whichever occurs first.
   Sec. 28. PROHIBITION OF IMPOSITION OF SEASONAL LOAD RESTRICTIONS.
    The commissioner of transportation may not impose seasonal restrictions as to the weight
of vehicles to be operated on marked Trunk Highway 11 between the cities of Baudette and
International Falls.

    (d) The commissioner must review the organizational documents of each applicant for
certification and the business history of each applicant, determine whether the applicant has

not, directly or indirectly:
   (1) beneficially own, whether through rights, options, convertible interest, or otherwise, 15
percent or more of the voting securities or other voting ownership interest of a Minnesota business

   (2) manage a Minnesota business investment company; or
   (3) control the direction of investments for a Minnesota business investment company.
    (b) A Minnesota business investment company may obtain one or more guaranties, indemnities,

entitled to provide guaranties, indemnities, bonds, insurance policies, or other payment undertakings
in favor of the participating investors of a Minnesota business investment company and its affiliates
in this state.
    (c) This subdivision does not preclude a participating investor, insurance company, or other party
from exercising its legal rights and remedies, including, without limitation, interim management
of a Minnesota business investment company, in the event that a Minnesota business investment
company is in default of its statutory obligations or its contractual obligations to a participating
investor, insurance company, or other party, or from monitoring a Minnesota business investment
company to ensure its compliance with this section or disallowing any investments that have not

2472                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [38TH DAY

commissioner on the same day must be treated as having been filed contemporaneously. Any credit
allocation claims filed with the commissioner prior to the initial credit allocation claim filing date
will be deemed to have been filed on the initial credit allocation claim filing date. The commissioner
will set the initial credit allocation claim filing date to be not less than 120 days and not greater than
150 days after the commissioner begins accepting applications for certification.
    (c) If two or more Minnesota business investment companies file credit allocation claims with the
commissioner on behalf of their respective participating investors on the same day, and the aggregate
amount of credit allocation claims exceeds the aggregate limit of investment tax credits under this
section or the lesser amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day, then the credits shall be
allocated among the participating investors who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect
to the amounts claimed. The pro rata allocation for any one participating investor is the product
obtained by multiplying a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation
claim filed on behalf of a participating investor and the denominator of which is the total of all
credit allocation claims filed on behalf of all participating investors on that day, by the aggregate
limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day.
    (d) Within ten business days after the commissioner receives a credit allocation claim filed by a
Minnesota business investment company on behalf of one or more of its participating investors, the
commissioner must notify the Minnesota business investment company of the amount of credits
allocated to each of the participating investors of that Minnesota business investment company. In
the event a Minnesota business investment company does not receive an investment of designated
capital from each participating investor required to earn the amount of credits allocated to the
participating investor within ten business days of the Minnesota business investment company's
receipt of notice of allocation, then it shall notify the commissioner on or before the next business
day, and the credits allocated to the participating investor of the Minnesota business investment
company will be forfeited. The commissioner must then reallocate those forfeited credits among
the participating investors of the other Minnesota business investment companies on a pro rata
basis with respect to the credit allocation claims filed on behalf of the participating investors. The
commissioner may levy a fine of not more than $50,000 on any participating investor that does
not invest the full amount of designated capital required to fund the credits allocated to it by the
commissioner in accordance with the credit allocation claim filed on its behalf.
    (e) No participating investor, on an aggregate basis with its affiliates, may file an allocation
claim for more than 25 percent of the maximum amount of investment tax credits authorized
hereunder, regardless of whether the claim is made in connection with one or more Minnesota
business investment companies.
   Subd. 5. Requirements for continuance of certification. (a) To maintain its certification, a
Minnesota business investment company must make qualified investments as follows:
   (1) within two years after the allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company must
invest an amount equal to at least 35 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments; and
   (2) within three years after the allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company must
invest an amount equal to at least 50 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments.
   (b) Prior to making a proposed qualified investment in a specific business, a Minnesota business
investment company must request from the commissioner a written determination that the proposed
investment will qualify as a qualified investment in a qualified business. The commissioner must
38TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                       2473

notify a Minnesota business investment company within ten business days from the receipt of
a request of its determination and an explanation thereof. If the commissioner fails to notify
the Minnesota business investment company of its determination within the ten-day period, the
proposed investment must be deemed to be a qualified investment in a qualified business.
   (c) All designated capital not invested in qualified investments by a Minnesota business
investment company shall be held or invested in the manner the Minnesota business investment
company deems appropriate. Designated capital and proceeds of designated capital returned to a
Minnesota business investment company after being originally invested in qualified investments
may be invested again in qualified investments and the investment shall count toward the
requirements of paragraph (a) of this subdivision with respect to making investments of designated
capital in qualified investments.
    (d) If, within four years after its allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company
has not invested at least 80 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments, neither the
Minnesota business investment company nor its affiliates shall be permitted to receive management
fees.
   (e) If, within six years after its allocation date, a Minnesota business investment company has not
invested at least 100 percent of its designated capital in qualified investments, neither the Minnesota
business investment company nor its affiliates shall be permitted to receive management fees.
   (f) A Minnesota business investment company may not invest more than 15 percent of its
designated capital in any one qualified business without the specific approval of the commissioner.
   (g) For purposes of calculating the investment percentage thresholds of paragraph (a), the
cumulative amount of all qualified investments made by a Minnesota business investment company
from the allocation date must be considered.
   Subd. 6. Minnesota business investment company reporting requirements. (a) Each
Minnesota business investment company must report the following to the commissioner:
   (1) as soon as practicable after the receipt of designated capital:
    (i) the name of each participating investor from which the designated capital was received,
including the participating investor's insurance tax identification number;
   (ii) the amount of each participating investor's investment of designated capital; and
   (iii) the date on which the designated capital was received;
   (2) on an annual basis, on or before January 31 of each year:
   (i) the amount of the Minnesota business investment company's remaining uninvested designated
capital at the end of the immediately preceding taxable year;
   (ii) whether or not the Minnesota business investment company has invested more than 15

any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued

in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (12), and (13) and reduced by the
Minnesota assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under section

    Subd. 2. Credit allowed. A taxpayer who incurs costs for the rehabilitation of eligible property
may take a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter in an amount equal to 20 percent of
the total costs of rehabilitation. Costs of rehabilitation include, but are not limited to, qualified
rehabilitation expenditures as defined under section 47(c)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code,
provided that the costs of rehabilitation must exceed 50 percent of the total basis in the property
at the time the rehabilitation activity begins and the rehabilitation must meet standards consistent
with the standards of the Secretary of the Interior for rehabilitation as determined by the State
Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society.
    Subd. 3. Carryforward. If the amount of the credit under subdivision 2 exceeds the tax liability
under this chapter for the year in which the cost is incurred, the amount that exceeds the tax liability
may be carried forward to each of the ten taxable years succeeding the taxable year in which the
expense was incurred. The entire amount of the credit must be carried to the earliest taxable year to
which the amount may be carried. The unused portion of the credit must be carried to the following
taxable year.
    Subd. 4. Partnerships; multiple owners; transfers. (a) Credits granted to a partnership, a
limited liability company taxed as a partnership, or multiple owners of property shall be passed
through to the partners, members, or owners, respectively, pro rata or pursuant to an executed

    (b) Taxpayers eligible for credits may transfer, sell, or assign the credits in whole or part. Any
assignee may use acquired credits to offset up to 100 percent of the taxes otherwise imposed by this
chapter. The assignee shall perfect such transfer by notifying the Department of Revenue in writing

Historic Preservation Office shall issue certificates verifying eligibility for and the amount of credit.
The taxpayer shall attach the certificate to any income tax return on which the credit is claimed.
The State Historic Preservation Office of the Minnesota Historical Society may collect fees for
applications for the historic preservation tax credit. Fees shall be set at an amount that does not

    Subd. 6. Mortgage certificates; credit for lending institutions. (a) The taxpayer may elect, in
lieu of the credit otherwise allowed under this section, to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage
credit certificate.
     (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit is a certificate that
is issued to the taxpayer according to procedures prescribed by the State Historic Preservation Office
with respect to the certified rehabilitation and which meets the requirements of this paragraph. The
face amount of the certificate must be equal to the credit that would be allowable under subdivision
2 to the taxpayer with respect to the rehabilitation. The certificate may only be transferred by the
taxpayer to a lending institution, including a nondepository home mortgage lending institution, in
connection with a loan:
   (1) that is secured by the building with respect to which the credit is issued; and
   (2) the proceeds of which may not be used for any purpose other than the acquisition or
rehabilitation of the building.
    (c) In exchange for the certificate, the lending institution must provide to the taxpayer an amount
equal to the face amount of the certificate discounted by the amount by which the federal income tax
liability of the lending institution is increased due to its use of the certificate in the manner provided
in this section. That amount must be applied, as directed by the taxpayer, in whole or in part, to
reduce:
   (1) the principal amount of the loan;
   (2) the rate of interest on the loan; or
    (3) the taxpayer's cost of purchasing the building, but only in the case of a qualified historic home
that is located in a poverty-impacted area as designated by the State Historic Preservation Office.
The lending institution may take as a credit against the tax due under this chapter an amount equal to
the amount specified in the certificate. If the amount of the discount retained by the lender exceeds
the amount by which the lending institution's federal income tax liability is increased due to the use
of a mortgage credit certificate, the excess shall be refunded to the borrower with interest at the rate
prescribed by the State Historic Preservation Office. The lending institution may carry forward all
unused credits under this subdivision until exhausted. Nothing in this subdivision requires a lending
institution to accept a historic rehabilitation certificate from any person.
    Subd. 7. National landmarks. Notwithstanding subdivision 2, the rehabilitation of a property
designated as a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, shall be
eligible for the credit under this section provided the renovation of the specific property, designated
as the National Historic Landmark, without regard to its being part of a larger project, is consistent
with the standards set forth in section 47(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and all other requirements
of this section are met.
    Subd. 8. Determination of economic impact. The Minnesota Historical Society shall annually
determine the economic impact to the state from the rehabilitation of eligible property for which
credits are provided under this section and report on the impact to the committees on taxes of the
senate and house of representatives.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years after December 31, 2008, except

    (a)(1) Subject to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3), income from wages as defined in section 3401(a)

entertainer, income from compensation for labor or personal services performed within this state
shall be determined in the following manner:
    (i) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident
salaried athletic team employee shall be determined by using a fraction in which the denominator
contains the total number of days in which the individual is under a duty to perform for the
employer, and the numerator is the total number of those days spent in Minnesota. For purposes
of this paragraph, off-season training activities, unless conducted at the team's facilities as part of
a team imposed program, are not included in the total number of duty days. Bonuses earned as a
result of play during the regular season or for participation in championship, play-off, or all-star
games must be allocated under the formula. Signing bonuses are not subject to allocation under the
formula if they are not conditional on playing any games for the team, are payable separately from
any other compensation, and are nonrefundable; and
    (ii) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident,
and who is an athlete or entertainer not listed in clause (i), for that person's athletic or entertainment
performance in Minnesota shall be determined by assigning to this state all income from
performances or athletic contests in this state.
    (3) For purposes of this section, amounts received by a nonresident as "retirement income" as
defined in section (b)(1) of the State Income Taxation of Pension Income Act, Public Law 104-95,
are not considered income derived from carrying on a trade or business or from wages or other
compensation for work an employee performed in Minnesota, and are not taxable under this chapter.
   (b) Income or gains from tangible property located in this state that is not employed in the
business of the recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state.
    (c) Income or gains from intangible personal property not employed in the business of the
recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state if the recipient of the income or gains
is a resident of this state or is a resident trust or estate.
    Gain on the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original
cost of partnership tangible property in this state to the original cost of partnership tangible
property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. If more than 50 percent of the value of
the partnership's assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest
is allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full
tax period immediately preceding the tax period of the partnership during which the partnership
interest was sold.
    Gain on the sale of an interest in a single member limited liability company that is disregarded
for federal income tax purposes is allocable to this state as if the single member limited liability
company did not exist and the assets of the limited liability company are personally owned by the
sole member.
   Gain on the sale of goodwill or income from a covenant not to compete that is connected with
a business operating all or partially in Minnesota is allocated to this state to the extent that the
income from the business in the year preceding the year of sale was assignable to Minnesota under
subdivision 3.
   When an employer pays an employee for a covenant not to compete, the income allocated to this

state is in the ratio of the employee's service in Minnesota in the calendar year preceding leaving the
employment of the employer over the total services performed by the employee for the employer in
that year.
    (d) Income from winnings on a bet made by an individual while in Minnesota is assigned to this
state. In this paragraph, "bet" has the meaning given in section 609.75, subdivision 2, as limited by
section 609.75, subdivision 3, clauses (1), (2), and (3).
   (e) All items of gross income not covered in paragraphs (a) to (d) and not part of the taxpayer's
income from a trade or business shall be assigned to the taxpayer's domicile.
   (f) For the purposes of this section, working as an employee shall not be considered to be
conducting a trade or business.

trades or businesses that receive permission to use some other method under section 290.20 or
under subdivision 4, a trade or business required to apportion its net income must apportion its
income to this state on the basis of the percentage obtained by taking the sum of:

within this state in connection with the trade or business during the tax period are of the total sales
wherever made in connection with the trade or business during the tax period;

tangible property used by the taxpayer in this state in connection with the trade or business during
the tax period is of the total tangible property, wherever located, used by the taxpayer in connection
with the trade or business during the tax period; and
    (3) the percent for the payroll factor under paragraph (b) of the percentage which the taxpayer's
total payrolls paid or incurred in this state or paid in respect to labor performed in this state in
connection with the trade or business during the tax period are of the taxpayer's total payrolls paid
or incurred in connection with the trade or business during the tax period.

   Sec. 14. [297I.23] MINNESOTA BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY CREDIT.
    (a) A participating investor as defined under section 116J.665, subdivision 1, is allowed a credit
against the tax imposed in this chapter equal to 80 percent of the participating investor's investment
of designated capital in a Minnesota business investment company. Beginning January 1, 2014, a
participating investor may claim the credit as follows:
   (1) in tax year 2014, an amount equal to 16 percent of the participating investor's investment of
designated capital;
   (2) in tax year 2015, an amount equal to 16 percent of the participating investor's investment of
designated capital;
   (3) in tax year 2016, an amount equal to 16 percent of the participating investor's investment of
designated capital;
   (4) in tax year 2017, an amount equal to 16 percent of the participating investor's investment of
designated capital; and
   (5) in tax year 2018, an amount equal to 16 percent of the participating investor's investment of
designated capital.
    (b) The credit for any taxable year must not exceed the liability for tax under this chapter for
the year. If the amount of the credit determined under this section for any taxable year exceeds the
liability for tax under this chapter, the excess shall be an investment tax credit carryover to future
taxable years without limitation. Credits may be used in connection with both final payments and
prepayments of a participating investor's state premium tax liability.
   (c) A participating investor claiming a credit under this section is not required to pay any
additional retaliatory tax levied as a result of claiming the credit.
    (d) If the taxes paid by a participating investor with respect to its state premium tax liability
constitute a credit against any other tax that is imposed by this state, the participating investor's credit
against the other tax shall not be reduced by virtue of the reduction in the participating investor's
tax liability based on the tax credit allowed under this section.
    (e) Final decertification of Minnesota business investment company under section 116J.665 may
result in the disallowance and the recapture of the credit allowed under this section. The amount to

be disallowed and recaptured must be assessed as follows:
    (1) decertification of a Minnesota business investment company within two years of its allocation
date and prior to meeting the requirements of section 116J.665, subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause
(1), shall result in the disallowance of all of the credits allowed under this section; and
    (2) decertification of Minnesota business investment company that has already met the
requirements of section 116J.665, subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (1), shall not cause the
disallowance of any credits allowed under this section nor the recapture of any portion of the
credits that was previously taken.
    (f) A participating investor must not transfer, agree to transfer, sell, or agree to sell the credit
under this section until 180 days from the date on which the participating investor invested
designated capital. After 180 days from the date of investment, a participating investor, or
subsequent transferee, may transfer credits based upon rules adopted by the commissioner to
facilitate the transfers. Any transfer or sale of the credits does not affect the time schedule for
claiming the credit. Any tax credits recaptured under this section remain the liability of the
participating investor that applied the credit towards its tax liability.

   (3) On all over $102,030, 7.85 percent.
    Married individuals filing separate returns, estates, and trusts must compute their income tax by

determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the

    Subd. 2. Use of revenues. Revenues received from the tax authorized by subdivision 1 may only
be used by the city to pay the cost of collecting the tax, and to pay for the following projects or to
secure or pay any principal, premium, or interest on bonds issued in accordance with subdivision 3
for the following projects.
    (a) To pay all or a portion of the capital expenses of construction, equipment and acquisition costs
for the expansion and remodeling of the St. Paul Civic Center complex, including the demolition of
the existing arena and the construction and equipping of a new arena.
   (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f), the remainder of the funds must be spent for:
   (1) capital projects to further residential, cultural, commercial, and economic development in
both downtown St. Paul and St. Paul neighborhoods; and
   (2) capital and operating expenses of cultural organizations in the city, provided that the amount
spent under this clause must equal ten percent of the total amount spent under this paragraph in any
year.
    (c) The amount apportioned under paragraph (b) shall be no less than 60 percent of the revenues
derived from the tax each year, except to the extent that a portion of that amount is required to
pay debt service on (1) bonds issued for the purposes of paragraph (a) prior to March 1, 1998; or
(2) bonds issued for the purposes of paragraph (a) after March 1, 1998, but only if the city council
determines that 40 percent of the revenues derived from the tax together with other revenues pledged
to the payment of the bonds, including the proceeds of definitive bonds, is expected to exceed the
annual debt service on the bonds.
    (d) If in any year more than 40 percent of the revenue derived from the tax authorized by
subdivision 1 is used to pay debt service on the bonds issued for the purposes of paragraph (a) and to
fund a reserve for the bonds, the amount of the debt service payment that exceeds 40 percent of the
revenue must be determined for that year. In any year when 40 percent of the revenue produced by
the sales tax exceeds the amount required to pay debt service on the bonds and to fund a reserve for
the bonds under paragraph (a), the amount of the excess must be made available for capital projects
to further residential, cultural, commercial, and economic development in the neighborhoods and
downtown until the cumulative amounts determined for all years under the preceding sentence
have been made available under this sentence. The amount made available as reimbursement in
the preceding sentence is not included in the 60 percent determined under paragraph (c).

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.41, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Retired employee health benefits. A district may levy an amount up to the amount the
district is required by the collective bargaining agreement in effect on March 30, 1992, to pay for
health insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who
have terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or
other active service, as applicable, either (1) before July 1, 1992, or (2) before July 1, 1998, but for
employees retiring after June 30, 1992, and before July 1, 1998, only if a sunset clause is in effect
for the current collective bargaining agreement. The total amount of the levy each year may not
exceed $600,000.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144F.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Board. The special taxing district under this section is governed by a board made up
initially of representatives of each participating political subdivision in the proportions set out in the
establishing resolution, subject to change as provided in the district's charter, if any, or in the district's
bylaws. If a township states in its resolution that less than the entire township will participate in the
district, the partial townships shall be represented on the board by only one member, appointed
from among those townships so participating. The method for appointment shall be governed by
the bylaws of the district's joint powers agreement. Each participant's representative serves at the
pleasure of that participant's governing body or bodies.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 272.02, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Institutions of public charity. (a) Institutions of purely public charity that are exempt
from federal income taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are exempt.         ­
if they meet the requirements of this subdivision. In determining whether real property is exempt
under this subdivision, the following factors must be considered:
   (1) whether the stated purpose of the undertaking is to be helpful to others without immediate
expectation of material reward;
   (2) whether the institution of public charity is supported by material donations, gifts, or
government grants for services to the public in whole or in part;
    (3) whether a material number of the recipients of the charity receive benefits or services at
reduced or no cost, or whether the organization provides services to the public that alleviate burdens
or responsibilities that would otherwise be borne by the government;

   (4) if income received, including material gifts and donations, that produces a profit to the
charitable institution is not distributed to private interests;
    (5) whether the beneficiaries of the charity are restricted or unrestricted, and, if restricted,
whether the class of persons to whom the charity is made available is one having a reasonable
relationship to the charitable objectives; and
    (6) whether dividends, in form or substance, or assets upon dissolution, are available to private
interests.
    A charitable organization must satisfy the factors in clauses (1) to (6) for its property to be
exempt under this subdivision, unless there is a compelling factual reason for failing to meet the
factors in clause (2), (3), or (5). If there is a compelling factual reason for failing to meet the factors
in clause (2), (3), or (5), an organization is a purely public charity under this subdivision without
meeting those factors.
    After an exemption is properly granted under this subdivision, it will remain in effect unless
there is a material change in facts.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a grant is a written instrument or electronic document
defining a legal relationship between a granting agency and a grantee when the principal purpose of
the relationship is to transfer cash or something of value to the grantee to support a public purpose
authorized by law in a general manner instead of acquiring by professional or technical contract,
purchase, lease, or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the granting agency.
   (c) In determining whether rental housing property qualifies for exemption under this
subdivision, the following are not gifts or donations to the owner of the rental housing:
   (1) rent assistance provided by the government to or on behalf of tenants; and
   (2) financing assistance or tax credits provided by the government to the owner on condition that
specific units or a specific quantity of units be set aside for persons or families with certain income
characteristics.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 272.02, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Personal property used for pollution control. Personal property used primarily for
the abatement and control of air, water, or land pollution is exempt to the extent that it is so used,
and real property is exempt if it is used primarily for abatement and control of air, water, or land
pollution as part of an agricultural operation, as a part of a centralized treatment and recovery facility
operating under a permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency pursuant to chapters
115 and 116 and Minnesota Rules, parts 7001.0500 to 7001.0730, and 7045.0020 to 7045.1260,
as a wastewater treatment facility and for the treatment, recovery, and stabilization of metals, oils,
chemicals, water, sludges, or inorganic materials from hazardous industrial wastes, or as part of an
electric generation system. For purposes of this subdivision, personal property includes ponderous
machinery and equipment used in a business or production activity that at common law is considered
real property.

device, or part thereof, operated primarily for the control or abatement of air, water, or land pollution
shall file an application with the commissioner of revenue. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
shall upon request of the commissioner furnish information and advice to the commissioner.
    The information and advice furnished by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency must
include statements as to whether the equipment, device, or real property meets a standard, rule,
criteria, guideline, policy, or order of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, and whether the
equipment, device, or real property is installed or operated in accordance with it. In the case of an
exemption requested under this subdivision for personal property at an electric generation facility,
the commissioner must submit the advice provided by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to
the municipality and the county in which the property is located for their approval. If the county
and municipality do not submit their approval or disapproval to the commissioner within 90 days,
the exemption is deemed to be approved. On determining that property qualifies for exemption,
the commissioner shall issue an order exempting the property from taxation. The equipment,
device, or real property shall continue to be exempt from taxation as long as the order issued by the
commissioner remains in effect.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 272.02, subdivision 86, is amended to read:

the highest number of animals tested on the property for bovine tuberculosis in a whole-herd test
as reported by the Board of Animal Health in 2006, 2007, or 2008. The amount of the credit cannot
exceed the property tax payable on the property where the herd had been located, excluding any
tax attributable to residential structures. To begin to qualify for the tax credit, the owner shall file
an application with the county by December 1 of the levy year. The credit must be given for each
subsequent taxes payable year until the credit terminates under subdivision 4. The assessor shall
indicate the amount of the property tax reduction on the property tax statement of each taxpayer
receiving a credit under this section. The credit paid pursuant to this section shall be deducted from
the tax due on the property as provided in section 273.1393.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for property taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
    Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
    Subd. 24. Class 3. (a) Commercial and industrial property and utility real and personal property
is class 3a.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided, each parcel of commercial, industrial, or utility real property
has a class rate of 1.5 percent of the first tier of market value, and 2.0 percent of the remaining market
value. In the case of contiguous parcels of property owned by the same person or entity, only the
value equal to the first-tier value of the contiguous parcels qualifies for the reduced class rate, except
that contiguous parcels owned by the same person or entity shall be eligible for the first-tier value
class rate on each separate business operated by the owner of the property, provided the business
is housed in a separate structure. For the purposes of this subdivision, the first tier means the first
$150,000 of market value. Real property owned in fee by a utility for transmission line right-of-way
shall be classified at the class rate for the higher tier.
    For purposes of this subdivision, parcels are considered to be contiguous even if they are
separated from each other by a road, street, waterway, or other similar intervening type of property.
Connections between parcels that consist of power lines or pipelines do not cause the parcels to
be contiguous. Property owners who have contiguous parcels of property that constitute separate
businesses that may qualify for the first-tier class rate shall notify the assessor by July 1, for
treatment beginning in the following taxes payable year.

tax levy for taxes payable in the following year.
    (b) On or before September 30, each school district that has not mutually agreed with its home

payable in the following year. Each school district that has agreed with its home county to delay
the certification of its proposed property tax levy must certify its proposed property tax levy for the

    (c) If the board of estimate and taxation or any similar board that establishes maximum tax levies
for taxing jurisdictions within a first class city certifies the maximum property tax levies for funds
under its jurisdiction by charter to the county auditor by September 15, the city shall be deemed to
have certified its levies for those taxing jurisdictions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, "taxing authority" includes all home rule and statutory
cities, towns, counties, school districts, and special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066.
Intermediate school districts that levy a tax under chapter 124 or 136D, joint powers boards
established under sections 123A.44 to 123A.446, and Common School Districts No. 323,
Franconia, and No. 815, Prinsburg, are also special taxing districts for purposes of this section.
    (e) At the meeting at which the taxing authority, other than a town, adopts its proposed tax levy
under paragraph (a) or (b), the taxing authority shall announce the time and place of its subsequent
regularly scheduled meetings at which the budget and levy will be discussed and at which the public
will be allowed to speak. The time and place of those meetings must be included in the proceedings
or summary of proceedings published in the official newspaper of the taxing authority under sections
123B.09, 375.12, or 412.191.
      Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
      (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
      (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. ­                                                          In

   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;

    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
    (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.
    (i) For purposes of this subdivision, subdivisions 5a and 6, "metropolitan special taxing districts"
means the following taxing districts in the seven-county metropolitan area that levy a property tax
for any of the specified purposes listed below:
   (1) Metropolitan Council under section 473.132, 473.167, 473.249, 473.325, 473.446, 473.521,
473.547, or 473.834;
    (2) Metropolitan Airports Commission under section 473.667, 473.671, or 473.672; and
    (3) Metropolitan Mosquito Control Commission under section 473.711.
    For purposes of this section, any levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of
Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be

in the following year, at a public hearing, if a public hearing is required under subdivision 6. The
notice must be published not less than two business days nor more than six business days before the
hearing.
    The advertisement must be at least one-eighth page in size of a standard-size or a tabloid-size
newspaper. The advertisement must not be placed in the part of the newspaper where legal notices

    In addition to other requirements, a county and a city having a population of more than 2,500
must show in the public advertisement required under this subdivision the current local tax rate,
the proposed local tax rate if no property tax levy increase is adopted, and the proposed rate if
the proposed levy is adopted. For purposes of this subdivision, "local tax rate" means the city's or
county's net tax capacity levy divided by the city's or county's taxable net tax capacity.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), the advertisement for school districts, metropolitan
special taxing districts, and regional library districts must be in the following form, except that
the notice for a school district may include references to the current budget in regard to proposed

   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.62, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Report on taxes levied. The commissioner of revenue shall establish procedures
for the annual reporting of local government levies. Each local governmental unit shall submit a
report to the commissioner by December 30 of the year in which the tax is levied. The report shall
include, but is not limited to, information on the amount of the tax levied by the governmental unit
for the following purposes:
   (1) social services and related programs, which include taxes levied for the purposes defined in
Minnesota Statutes 1991 Supplement, section 275.50, subdivision 5, clauses (a), (j), and (v);
   (2) the amounts levied for each of the purposes listed in Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.70,
subdivision 5; and
    (3) other levies, which include the taxes levied for all purposes not included in clause (1), (2),
or (3).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 279.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Due dates; penalties. Except as provided in subdivision 3 or 4, on May 16 or
21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is
later, a penalty accrues and thereafter is charged upon all unpaid taxes on real estate on the current
lists in the hands of the county treasurer. The penalty is at a rate of two percent on homestead
property until May 31 and four percent on June 1. The penalty on nonhomestead property is at a
rate of four percent until May 31 and eight percent on June 1. This penalty does not accrue until
June 1 of each year, or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property
tax statements, whichever is later, on commercial use real property used for seasonal residential
recreational purposes and classified as class 1c or 4c, and on other commercial use real property
classified as class 3a, provided that over 60 percent of the gross income earned by the enterprise on
the class 3a property is earned during the months of May, June, July, and August. In order for the first

half of the tax due on class 3a property to be paid after May 15 and before June 1, or 21 days after
the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is later, without
penalty, the owner of the property must attach an affidavit to the payment attesting to compliance
with the income provision of this subdivision. Thereafter, for both homestead and nonhomestead
property, on the first day of each month beginning July 1, up to and including October 1 following,
an additional penalty of one percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes
provided that if the due date was extended beyond May 15 as the result of any delay in mailing
property tax statements no additional penalty shall accrue if the tax is paid by the extended due
date. If the tax is not paid by the extended due date, then all penalties that would have accrued if the
due date had been May 15 shall be charged. When the taxes against any tract or lot exceed $  ­­5­
                                                                                                0 $250,
one-half thereof may be paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope
containing the property tax statement, whichever is later; and, if so paid, no penalty attaches; the
remaining one-half may be paid at any time prior to October 16 following, without penalty; but,
if not so paid, then a penalty of two percent accrues thereon for homestead property and a penalty
of four percent on nonhomestead property. Thereafter, for homestead property, on the first day of
November an additional penalty of four percent accrues and on the first day of December following,
an additional penalty of two percent accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. Thereafter,
for nonhomestead property, on the first day of November and December following, an additional
penalty of four percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. If one-half of
such taxes are not paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing
the property tax statement, whichever is later, the same may be paid at any time prior to October
16, with accrued penalties to the date of payment added, and thereupon no penalty attaches to the
remaining one-half until October 16 following.
    This section applies to payment of personal property taxes assessed against improvements to
leased property, except as provided by section 277.01, subdivision 3.
    A county may provide by resolution that in the case of a property owner that has multiple tracts
or parcels with aggregate taxes exceeding ­$5­0
                                              ­ $250, payments may be made in installments as
provided in this subdivision.
     The county treasurer may accept payments of more or less than the exact amount of a tax
installment due. Payments must be applied first to the oldest installment that is due but which
has not been fully paid. If the accepted payment is less than the amount due, payments must be
applied first to the penalty accrued for the year or the installment being paid. Acceptance of partial
payment of tax does not constitute a waiver of the minimum payment required as a condition for
filing an appeal under section 278.03 or any other law, nor does it affect the order of payment of
delinquent taxes under section 280.39.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 428A.13, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Prerequisites for establishing. Prior to establishment of a housing improvement area,
the governing body of the city must:
   (1) provide full disclosure of public expenditures, as well as the terms of any loans, bonds, or
other financing arrangements for housing improvement area projects; and
   (2) ensure that all contracts for housing improvement projects are subject to section 471.345.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 428A.14, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority. Fees may be imposed by the implementing entity on the housing
units within the housing improvement area at a rate, term, or amount sufficient to produce revenue
required to provide housing improvements in the area to reimburse the implementing entity
for advances made to pay for the housing improvements or to pay principal of, interest on, and
premiums, if any, on bonds issued by the implementing entity under section 428A.16. The fee
can be imposed on the basis of the tax capacity of the housing unit, or the total amount of square
footage of the housing unit, or a method determined by the council and specified in the resolution.
If a fee is imposed on a basis other than the tax capacity or square footage of the housing unit, the
council must make a finding that the alternative basis for the fee is a more equitable basis. Fees
imposed under this section must meet the standard for benefit to property as provided for special
assessments under chapter 429, and are subject to the same appeal processes provided under
chapter 429. Before the imposition of the fees, a hearing must be held and notice must be published
in the official newspaper at least seven days before the hearing and shall be mailed at least seven
days before the hearing to any housing unit owner subject to a fee. For purposes of this section, the
notice must also include:
   (1) a statement that all interested persons will be given an opportunity to be heard at the hearing
regarding a proposed housing improvement fee;
    (2) the estimated cost of improvements including administrative costs to be paid for in whole or
in part by the fee imposed under the ordinance;
   (3) the amount to be charged against the particular property;
   (4) the right of the property owner to prepay the entire fee;
   (5) the number of years the fee will be in effect; and
   (6) a statement that the petition requirements of section 428A.12 have either been met or do not
apply to the proposed fee.
   Within six months of the public hearing, the implementing entity may adopt a resolution
imposing a fee within the area not exceeding the amount expressed in the notice issued under this
38TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                      2547

section.
    Prior to adoption of the resolution approving the fee, the condominium associations located in
the housing improvement area shall submit to the implementing entity a financial plan prepared by
an independent third party, acceptable to the implementing entity and associations, that provides for
the associations to finance maintenance and operation of the common elements in the condominium
and a long-range plan to conduct and finance capital improvements.

municipality by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 475, when necessary to accomplish its duties.
    Subd. 5. Withdrawal. Notice of intent to withdraw from participation in the district may be

property that had been classified as agricultural for property tax purposes for taxes payable in 2009
based on the use of the land for breeding or boarding horses, may appeal the classification of the land
for taxes payable in 2010 to the commissioner of revenue if the use of the land has not substantially
changed. The appeal must be in written form, and must be received by the commissioner before

administer sections 43 and 44.
   Sec. 58. PURPOSE; COMMISSIONER GUIDANCE.
    The purpose of section 6 is not to contract or expand the definition of "institutions of purely
public charity" but to provide clear standards that can be applied uniformly to determine eligibility
for exemption from property taxations. To carry out this purpose and to promote uniformity in
application of the provisions of this section and section 6, the commissioner of revenue shall
prepare a bulletin providing guidance to assessors as to the commissioner's interpretation of section
6. The bulletin may include a discussion of court decisions relevant to the requirements in section
6. This guidance must include examples of facts or circumstances that satisfy the requirement of "a
compelling factual reason for failing to meet the factors in clause (2), (3), or (5)" under section 6.
Assessors must implement the guidance provided in the bulletin when assessing property for which
an exemption as an institution of purely public charity has been requested. The commissioner shall
distribute the bulletin to all assessors by July 1, 2010.

account funded with tax increments from other districts or with other public money;
   (4) be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (b) The authority must annually submit to the state auditor a financial report in compliance with
paragraph (a). Copies of the report must also be provided to the county auditor and to the governing
body of the municipality, if the authority is not the municipality. To the extent necessary to permit
compliance with the requirement of financial reporting, the county and any other appropriate local
government unit or private entity must provide the necessary records or information to the authority
or the state auditor as provided by the system of accounting and financial reporting developed
pursuant to paragraph (a). The authority must submit the annual report for a year on or before August
1 of the next year.

subdivision 1;
   (2) the net tax capacity for the reporting period of the district and any subdistrict;
   (3) the captured net tax capacity of the district;
   (4) any fiscal disparity deduction from the captured net tax capacity under section 469.177,
subdivision 3;

469.177, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (2);
   (7) the type of district;

    (1) after 15 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a renewal and renovation
district,
   (2) after 20 years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for a soils condition district,
   (3) after eight years after receipt by the authority of the first increment for an economic
development district,
   (4) for a housing district, a compact development district, or a redevelopment district, after 25
years from the date of receipt by the authority of the first increment.
    (b) For purposes of determining a duration limit under this subdivision or subdivision 1e that
is based on the receipt of an increment, any increments from taxes payable in the year in which
the district terminates shall be paid to the authority. This paragraph does not affect a duration limit
calculated from the date of approval of the tax increment financing plan or based on the recovery of
costs or to a duration limit under subdivision 1c. This paragraph does not supersede the restrictions
on payment of delinquent taxes in subdivision 1f.
    (c) An action by the authority to waive or decline to accept an increment has no effect for
purposes of computing a duration limit based on the receipt of increment under this subdivision
or any other provision of law. The authority is deemed to have received an increment for any year
in which it waived or declined to accept an increment, regardless of whether the increment was paid
to the authority.
    (d) Receipt by a hazardous substance subdistrict of an increment as a result of a reduction in
original net tax capacity under section 469.174, subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not constitute
receipt of increment by the overlying district for the purpose of calculating the duration limit under
this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after June 30, 2009.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.176, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

development district may be used only to pay:
   (1) administrative expenses up to the amount permitted under subdivision 3;
   (2) the cost of acquiring land located in the district or abutting the boundary of the district;
    (3) demolition and removal of buildings or other improvements and other site preparation costs
for lands located in the district or abutting the boundary of the district; and
    (4) installation of public infrastructure or public improvements serving the district, but excluding
the costs of streets, roads, highways, parking, or other public improvements primarily designed to
serve private passenger motor vehicles.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification
is made after June 30, 2009.

   Subd. 3. Limitation on administrative expenses.
    (a) For districts for which certification was requested before August 1, 1979, or after June 30,
1982 and before August 1, 2001, no tax increment shall be used to pay any administrative expenses
for a project which exceed ten percent of the total estimated tax increment expenditures authorized
by the tax increment financing plan or the total tax increment expenditures for the project, whichever
is less.
    (b) For districts for which certification was requested after July 31, 1979, and before July 1, 1982,
no tax increment shall be used to pay administrative expenses, as defined in Minnesota Statutes
1980, section 273.73, for a district which exceeds five percent of the total tax increment expenditures
authorized by the tax increment financing plan or the total estimated tax increment expenditures for
the district, whichever is less.
    (c) For districts for which certification was requested after July 31, 2001, no tax increment
may be used to pay any administrative expenses for a project which exceed ten percent of total
estimated tax increment expenditures authorized by the tax increment financing plan or the total tax
increments, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision 25, clause (1), from the district, whichever
is less.
   (d) Increments used to pay the county's administrative expenses under subdivision 4h are not
subject to the percentage limits in this subdivision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for all districts, regardless of when the request
for certification was made.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,

    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.034, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. General obligation revenue bonds. (a) An authority may pledge the general obligation
of the general jurisdiction governmental unit as additional security for bonds payable from income
or revenues of the project or the authority. The authority must find that the pledged revenues will
equal or exceed 110 percent of the principal and interest due on the bonds for each year. The proceeds
of the bonds must be used for a qualified housing development project or projects. The obligations
must be issued and sold in the manner and following the procedures provided by chapter 475, except
the obligations are not subject to approval by the electors, and the maturities may extend to not more
than 35 years for obligations sold to finance housing for the elderly and 40 years for other obligations
issued under this subdivision. The authority is the municipality for purposes of chapter 475.
    (b) The principal amount of the issue must be approved by the governing body of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged. Public hearings must be held on
issuance of the obligations by both the authority and the general jurisdiction governmental unit. The
hearings must be held at least 15 days, but not more than 120 days, before the sale of the obligations.
    (c) The maximum amount of general obligation bonds that may be issued and outstanding under
this section equals the greater of (1) one-half of one percent of the taxable market value of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged, or (2) $3,000,000. In the case
of county or multicounty general obligation bonds, the outstanding general obligation bonds of all
cities in the county or counties issued under this subdivision must be added in calculating the limit
under clause (1).
    (d) "General jurisdiction governmental unit" means the city in which the housing development
project is located. In the case of a county or multicounty authority, the county or counties may act
as the general jurisdiction governmental unit. In the case of a multicounty authority, the pledge of
the general obligation is a pledge of a tax on the taxable property in each of the counties.
    (e) "Qualified housing development project" means a housing development project providing
housing either for the elderly or for individuals and families with incomes not greater than 80 percent
of the median family income as estimated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development for the standard metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan county in which
the project is located. The project must be owned for the term of the bonds either by the authority

or by a limited partnership or other entity in which the authority or another entity under the sole
control of the authority is the sole general partner and the partnership or other entity must receive
(1) an allocation from the Department of Finance or an entitlement issuer of tax-exempt bonding
authority for the project and a preliminary determination by the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency
or the applicable suballocator of tax credits that the project will qualify for four percent low-income
housing tax credits or (2) a reservation of nine percent low-income housing tax credits from the
Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or a suballocator of tax credits for the project. A qualified
housing development project may admit nonelderly individuals and families with higher incomes
if:
   (1) three years have passed since initial occupancy;
    (2) the authority finds the project is experiencing unanticipated vacancies resulting in insufficient
revenues, because of changes in population or other unforeseen circumstances that occurred after
the initial finding of adequate revenues; and
    (3) the authority finds a tax levy or payment from general assets of the general jurisdiction
governmental unit will be necessary to pay debt service on the bonds if higher income individuals
or families are not admitted.
    (f) The authority may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under this subdivision in accordance
with section 475.67. The finding of the adequacy of pledged revenues required by paragraph (a) and
the public hearing required by paragraph (b) shall not apply to the issuance of refunding bonds. This
paragraph applies to refunding bonds issued on and after July 1, 1992.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.040, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Leased property, exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1, any
property other than property to be operated as a parking facility that the authority leases to private
individuals or corporations for development in connection with a redevelopment project shall have
the same tax status as if the leased property were owned by the private individuals or corporations.
This subdivision does not apply to leases by the authority to individuals or families for residential
use.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section applies to housing projects and housing development
projects constructed or acquired by an authority after July 1, 1987, for property taxes payable in
2010 and thereafter.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.040, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

    Subdivision 1. Generally. All occupation taxes paid by persons, copartnerships, companies,
joint stock companies, corporations, and associations, however or for whatever purpose organized,

on June 12, 1970, which does not contain a municipality qualifying pursuant to section 273.134,
paragraph (b), or (2) to provide economic development loans or grants to businesses located within

Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board regarding the loans. Payment to the Iron Range
Resources and Rehabilitation Board account shall be made by May 15 annually.
   Of the money allocated to Koochiching County, one-third must be paid to the Koochiching
County Economic Development Commission.
    Subd. 3. 2009 collections. If the amount of occupation tax proceeds collected in 2009 exceeds the

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 298.227, is amended to read:
   298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
   (a) An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production
and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
38TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                      2591

and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives
of the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that
producer. The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each
local employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the
employee committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees.
The review must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal
for expenditure of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be
released only for workforce development and associated public facility improvement, or for
acquisition of plant and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or for research
and development in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology,
but only if the producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at
least 50 percent of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with distributions in
2002. Effective for proposals for expenditures of money from the fund beginning May 26, 2007,
the commissioner may not release the funds before the next scheduled meeting of the board. If the
board rejects a proposed expenditure, the funds must be deposited in the Taconite Environmental
Protection Fund under sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a producer uses money which has been
released from the fund prior to May 26, 2007 to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or
mining shovels, and the producer removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area
defined in section 273.134 within ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a
portion of the money granted from the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development
fund. The portion of the money to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed
from the taconite tax relief area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund,
declining by ten percent for each of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains
within the taconite tax relief area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the
facility had ceased, any money remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to
the purchaser of the facility on the terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this
section. If a producer fails to provide matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months
after the commissioner approves release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another
producer in proportion to the distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any
portion of the fund which is not released by the commissioner within one year of its deposit in
the fund shall be divided between the taconite environmental protection fund created in section
298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292
for placement in their respective special accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds shall be
distributed to the taconite environmental protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson
economic protection trust fund.
    (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), setting the amount of distributions
and the review process, an amount equal to ten cents per taxable ton of production in 2007, for
distribution in 2008 only, that would otherwise be distributed under paragraph (a), may be used
for a loan for the cost of construction of a biomass energy facility. This amount must be deducted
from the distribution under paragraph (a) for which a matching expenditure by the producer
is not required. The granting of the loan is subject to approval by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board; interest must be payable on the loan at the rate prescribed in section
298.2213, subdivision 3. Repayments of the loan and interest must be deposited in the northeast
Minnesota economic development fund established in section 298.2213. If a loan is not made

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 298.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Imposed; calculation. (a) For concentrate produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003,
there is imposed upon taconite and iron sulphides, and upon the mining and quarrying thereof, and
upon the production of iron ore concentrate therefrom, and upon the concentrate so produced, a tax
of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced therefrom. For concentrates
produced in 2005, the tax rate is the same rate imposed for concentrates produced in 2004. For
concentrates produced in 2009 and subsequent years, the tax is also imposed upon other iron-bearing
material.
    (b) For concentrates produced in 2006 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to the
preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding year
to the fourth quarter of the preceding year, that may not be less than zero. "Implicit price deflator"
means the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.
    (c) An additional tax is imposed equal to three cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore
concentrate for each one percent that the iron content of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried
at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
    (d) The tax on taconite and iron sulphides shall be imposed on the average of the production for
the current year and the previous two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's
tax rate. This clause shall not apply in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property
taxes on the facility would be higher if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable. The tax
on other iron-bearing material shall be imposed on the current year production.
    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
    (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
   (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore from ore mined in this state, no tax is imposed under
38TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                         2593

this section. As used in this paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000
tons of direct reduced ore in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production"
is production of 50,000 tons or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is
ore that results in a product that has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of
a plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore
is 25 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial
production year, the rate is 50 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for
the fifth commercial production year, the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under
this subdivision; and for all subsequent commercial production years, the full rate is imposed. The
exemption from production tax under this paragraph does not subject the exempt property to ad
valorem taxation.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite, iron sulfides, or other
iron-bearing material, the production of taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material, that
is consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state is not subject to the tax imposed
by this section on taconite, iron sulfides, or other iron-bearing material.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained

the amount necessary to make this payment shall be derived from proportionate reductions in the
initial distribution to other school districts under clause (i).
    If there are insufficient tax proceeds to make the distribution provided under this paragraph in
any year, money must be transferred from the taconite property tax relief account in subdivision 6,
to the extent of the shortfall in the distribution.
    (d) Any school district described in paragraph (c) where a levy increase pursuant to section
126C.17, subdivision 9, was authorized by referendum for taxes payable in 2001, shall receive a
distribution of 21.3 cents per ton. Each district shall receive $175 times the pupil units identified in
section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the second previous year or the 1983-1984 school year,
whichever is greater, less the product of 1.8 percent times the district's taxable net tax capacity in
the second previous year.
    If the total amount provided by paragraph (d) is insufficient to make the payments herein required
then the entitlement of $175 per pupil unit shall be reduced uniformly so as not to exceed the
funds available. Any amounts received by a qualifying school district in any fiscal year pursuant
to paragraph (d) shall not be applied to reduce general education aid which the district receives

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for estates of decedents dying after December
31, 2008.
      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.31, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), or to a contractor required to withhold under section 290.92,
subdivision 31.

or tipboard deal. The sales tax imposed by chapter 297A on the sale of the pull-tabs and tipboards by
the distributor is imposed on the retail sales price less the tax imposed by this subdivision. The retail

and tipboard tickets. The claim must be filed with the commissioner on a form prescribed by the
commissioner by March 20 of the year following the calendar year for which the refund is claimed.
The refund must be filed as part of the customer's February monthly return. The refund or credit is
equal to 1.7 percent of the face value of the unsold pull-tab or tipboard tickets, provided that the
refund or credit will be 1.75 percent of the face value of the unsold pull-tab or tipboard tickets for
claims for a refund or credit of taxes filed on the February 2001 monthly return. The refund claimed
will be applied as a credit against tax owing under this chapter on the February monthly return.

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Determination of value. (a) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3
shall upon timely application by the owner, in the manner provided in subdivision 8, be determined
solely with reference to its appropriate agricultural classification and value notwithstanding
sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any added
values resulting from nonagricultural factors. In order to account for the presence of nonagricultural
influences that may affect the value of agricultural land, the commissioner of revenue shall develop
a fair and uniform method of determining agricultural values for each county in the state that are
consistent with this subdivision. The commissioner shall annually assign the resulting values to
each county, and these values shall be used as the basis for determining the agricultural value for
all properties in the county qualifying for tax deferment under this section.
    (b) In the case of property qualifying for tax deferment only under subdivision 3a, the value shall
be based on the value in effect for assessment year 2008, multiplied by the ratio of the total taxable
market value of all property in the county for the year prior to the current assessment year divided
by the total taxable market value of all property in the county for assessment year 2008.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.1115, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Requirement. Real estate is entitled to valuation under this section only if all of the
following requirements are met:
   (1) the property is classified as class 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b property under section 273.13, subdivisions
22 and 23, or the property is classified as class 2e under section 273.13, subdivision 23, and
immediately before being classified as class 2e was classified as class 1a or 1b;
     (2) the property is at least ten contiguous acres, when the application is filed under subdivision
3;
    (3) the owner has filed a completed application for deferment as specified in subdivision 3 with
the county assessor in the county in which the property is located;
     (4) there are no delinquent taxes on the property; and
     (5) a covenant on the land restricts its use as provided in subdivision 3, clause (4).
38TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                       2615

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.1231, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Utility property. "Utility property" means property appraised and classified for tax
purposes by order of the commissioner of revenue under sections 273.33 to 273.3711.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.124, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Cooperatives and charitable corporations; homestead and other property. (a)
When property is owned by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B,
and each person who owns a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to
occupy a building on the property, or a unit within a building on the property, the corporation or
association may claim homestead treatment for each dwelling, or for each unit in the case of a
building containing several dwelling units, or for the part of the value of the building occupied by a
shareholder. Each building or unit must be designated by legal description or number. The net tax
capacity of each building or unit that qualifies for assessment as a homestead under this subdivision
must include not more than one-half acre of land, if platted, nor more than 80 acres if unplatted.
The net tax capacity of the property is the sum of the net tax capacities of each of the respective
buildings or units comprising the property, including the net tax capacity of each unit's or building's
proportionate share of the land and any common buildings. To qualify for the treatment provided
by this subdivision, the corporation or association must be wholly owned by persons having a right
to occupy a building or unit owned by the corporation or association. A charitable corporation
organized under the laws of Minnesota and not otherwise exempt thereunder with no outstanding
stock qualifies for homestead treatment with respect to member residents of the dwelling units who
have purchased and hold residential participation warrants entitling them to occupy the units.
    (b) To the extent provided in paragraph (a), a cooperative or corporation organized under
chapter 308A or 308B may obtain separate assessment and valuation, and separate property
tax statements for each residential homestead, residential nonhomestead, or for each seasonal
residential recreational building or unit not used for commercial purposes. The appropriate class
rates under section 273.13 shall be applicable as if each building or unit were a separate tax parcel;
provided, however, that the tax parcel which exists at the time the cooperative or corporation
makes application under this subdivision shall be a single parcel for purposes of property taxes or
the enforcement and collection thereof, other than as provided in paragraph (a) or this paragraph.
    (c) A member of a corporation or association may initially obtain the separate assessment and
valuation and separate property tax statements, as provided in paragraph (b), by applying to the
assessor by June 30 of the assessment year.
    (d) When a building, or dwelling units within a building, no longer qualify under paragraph
(a) or (b), the current owner must notify the assessor within 30 days. Failure to notify the assessor
within 30 days shall result in the loss of benefits under paragraph (a) or (b) for taxes payable in the
year that the failure is discovered. For these purposes, "benefits under paragraph (a) or (b)" means
the difference in the net tax capacity of the building or units which no longer qualify as computed
under paragraph (a) or (b) and as computed under the otherwise applicable law, times the local tax
rate applicable to the building for that taxes payable year. Upon discovery of a failure to notify, the
assessor shall inform the auditor of the difference in net tax capacity for the building or buildings

in which units no longer qualify, and the auditor shall calculate the benefits under paragraph (a) or
(b). Such amount, plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of that amount, shall then be demanded of the
building's owner. The property owner may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a
petition for review with county officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing a proof of service
as provided in section 278.01 with the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice
from the county. The appeal shall be governed by the Tax Court procedures provided in chapter 271,
for cases relating to the tax laws as defined in section 271.01, subdivision 5; disregarding sections
273.125, subdivision 5, and 278.03, but including section 278.05, subdivision 2. If the amount of
the benefits under paragraph (a) or (b) and penalty are not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has
been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of the benefit and penalty to the succeeding
year's tax list to be collected as part of the property taxes on the affected property.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.124, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Manufactured home park cooperative. When a manufactured home park is owned
by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B, and each person who owns
a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to occupy a lot within the park, the
corporation or association may claim homestead treatment for each lot occupied by a shareholder.
Each lot must be designated by legal description or number, and each lot is limited to not more than
one-half acre of land for each homestead. The manufactured home park shall be valued and assessed
as if it were homestead property within class 1 if all of the following criteria are met:
   (1) the occupant is using the property as a permanent residence;
    (2) the occupant or the cooperative association is paying the ad valorem property taxes and any
special assessments levied against the land and structure either directly, or indirectly through dues
to the corporation; and
   (3) the corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B is wholly owned by
persons having a right to occupy a lot owned by the corporation or association.
    A charitable corporation, organized under the laws of Minnesota with no outstanding stock,
and granted a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, qualifies for
homestead treatment with respect to member residents of the manufactured home park who hold
residential participation warrants entitling them to occupy a lot in the manufactured home park.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.124, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.

The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property,        ­­o

    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
     The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, including the
federal income tax schedule F required by this section, or affidavits or other proofs of the property
owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support a claim for a property tax
homestead classification are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but, notwithstanding that section, the private data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue,
or, for purposes of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes
owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of
the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c) or (d), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
application must be signed by each relative of an owner who occupies the property and by each
relative's spouse who also occupies the property. The Social Security number of each relative and
spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be required on the homestead application filed
under this subdivision. If a different relative of the owner subsequently occupies the property, the
owner of the property must notify the assessor within 30 days of the change in occupancy. The
Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse occupying the property is private data on
individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12, but may be disclosed to the commissioner
of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal
property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that the application filed
under this section will not be mailed annually and that if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.

    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. If a homestead application
has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    (g) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give the commissioner a list that
includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or a spouse of a
qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification
as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite homestead credit under section 273.135,
the residential homestead and agricultural homestead credits under section 273.1384, and the
supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
   If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
38TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 22, 2009                                        2619

amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
   (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or spouse of a
qualifying relative;
   (iii) the classification of the property under section 273.13 for taxes payable in the current year
and in the prior year;
    (iv) an indication of whether the property was classified as a homestead for taxes payable in the
current year because of occupancy by a relative of the owner or by a spouse of a relative;
   (v) the property taxes payable as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 13, for the current year

and the prior year;
   (vi) the market value of improvements to the property first assessed for tax purposes for taxes
payable in the current year;
    (vii) the assessor's estimated market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the
current year and the prior year;
    (viii) the taxable market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the current year and
the prior year;
   (ix) whether there are delinquent property taxes owing on the homestead;
   (x) the unique taxing district in which the property is located; and
   (xi) such other information as the commissioner decides is necessary.
    The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate under the law,
including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter
290A.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for applications received after June 30, 2009.

    For purposes of this subdivision, "grantor" is defined as the person creating or establishing
a testamentary, inter Vivos, revocable or irrevocable trust by written instrument or through the
exercise of a power of appointment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property may
contain property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, including but not limited to sloughs,
wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches, and other similar land impractical for the assessor
to value separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor ­o

the reduced rate and provide the information required by the assessor to verify that the property
qualifies for the reduced rate. If the assessor receives the application and information before
May 1 in an assessment year, the property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the
assessor receives the application and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property
qualifies beginning with the next assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must
concur that the land is qualified. The commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide
county assessors verification information on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary

nonresidential structure as defined by the commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property
from classification under this paragraph.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural

use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or
cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.

     ­­) (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a
privately owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify
for classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
2624                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [38TH DAY

    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.

     l­ (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b. It has a class rate of one percent of market
value. To qualify for classification under this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous
acres in size and the owner of the property must record with the county recorder of the county in
which the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    ­
    (m­­
       ) (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to
be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.

for recreation purposes, including real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreation purposes and not devoted to commercial purposes for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause, property
is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is used for
residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property under this
clause must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups

for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property under this clause must provide recreational activities
such as renting ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski
equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing
tackle. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c under this
clause is also class 4c under this clause regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the
use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. In order for a property to be classified as class 4c,
seasonal residential recreational for commercial purposes under this clause, at least 40 percent of
the annual gross lodging receipts related to the property must be from business conducted during 90
consecutive days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the
year must be for periods of at least two consecutive nights; or (ii) at least 20 percent of the annual
gross receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles,
downhill or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina services, launch services, and guide
services, or the sale of bait and fishing tackle. For purposes of this determination, a paid booking
of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c property classified under this
clause also includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes in
conjunction with other class 4c property classified under this clause and devoted to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the
property is not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding
the year of assessment and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used.
Owners of real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for
recreation purposes and all or a portion of which was devoted to commercial purposes for not more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must
submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in
the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c
under this clause as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate
share of the land on which they are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property
desiring designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide guest registers or other
records demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for
more than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5)
other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c;
    (2) qualified property used as a golf course if:
   (i) it is open to the public on a daily fee basis. It may charge membership fees or dues, but a
membership fee may not be required in order to use the property for golfing, and its green fees for
golfing must be comparable to green fees typically charged by municipal courses; and
    (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;

3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.
   Class 4d property has a class rate of 0.75 percent.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 33, is amended to read:
   Subd. 33. Classification of unimproved property. (a) All real property that is not improved
with a structure must be classified according to its current use.
    (b) Except as provided in subdivision 23, paragraph (c) or (d), real property that is not improved
with a structure and for which there is no identifiable current use must be classified according to
its highest and best use permitted under the local zoning ordinance. If the ordinance permits more
than one use, the land must be classified according to the highest and best use permitted under
the ordinance. If no such ordinance exists, the assessor shall consider the most likely potential use
of the unimproved land based upon the use made of surrounding land or land in proximity to the
unimproved land.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.33, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Listing and assessment by commissioner. The personal property, consisting of
the pipeline system of mains, pipes, and equipment attached thereto, of pipeline companies and
others engaged in the operations or business of transporting natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, or
other petroleum products by pipelines, shall be listed with and assessed by the commissioner of
revenue and the values provided to the city or county assessor by order. This subdivision shall not
apply to the assessment of the products transported through the pipelines nor to the lines of local
commercial gas companies engaged primarily in the business of distributing gas to consumers at
retail nor to pipelines used by the owner thereof to supply natural gas or other petroleum products
exclusively for such owner's own consumption and not for resale to others. If more than 85 percent
of the natural gas or other petroleum products actually transported over the pipeline is used for

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 274.13, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Special board; delegated duties. The board of equalization for any county may appoint
a special board of equalization and may delegate to it the powers and duties in subdivision 1. The
special board of equalization shall serve at the direction and discretion of the appointing county
board, subject to the restrictions imposed by law on the appointing board. The appointing board
may determine the number of members to be appointed to the special board, the compensation and
expenses to be paid, and the term of office of each member. At least one member of the special
board of equalization must be an appraiser, realtor, or other person familiar with property valuations
in the county. The county auditor is a nonvoting member and serves as the recorder for the special
board. The special board is subject to the quorum requirements for county boards and the training
requirements for county boards in section 274.135, subdivision 2.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. The section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 274.135, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Proof of compliance; transfer of duties. (a) Any county that conducts county boards
of appeal and equalization meetings must provide proof to the commissioner by December 1, 2009,
and each year thereafter, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subdivision 2. Beginning
in 2009, this notice must also verify that there was a quorum of voting members at each meeting
of the board of appeal and equalization in the current year. A county that does not comply with
these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization powers to the
special board of equalization appointed pursuant to section 274.13, subdivision 2, beginning with
the following year's assessment and continuing unless the powers are reinstated under paragraph
(c). A county that does not comply with the requirements of subdivision 2 and has not appointed
a special board of equalization shall appoint a special board of equalization before the following
year's assessment.
   (b) The county shall notify the taxpayers when the board of appeal and equalization for a county

has been transferred to the special board of equalization under this subdivision and, prior to the
meeting time of the special board of equalization, the county shall make available to those taxpayers
a procedure for a review of the assessments, including, but not limited to, open book meetings. This
alternate review process must take place in April and May.
    (c) A county board whose powers are transferred to the special board of equalization under this
subdivision may be reinstated by resolution of the county board and upon proof of compliance with
the requirements of subdivision 2. The resolution and proofs must be provided to the commissioner
by December 1 in order to be effective for the following year's assessment.
    (d) If a person who was entitled to appeal to the county board of appeal and equalization or
to the county special board of equalization is not able to do so in a particular year because the
county board or special board did not meet the quorum and training requirements in this section
and section 274.13, or because the special board was not appointed, that person may instead appeal
to the commissioner of revenue, provided that the appeal is received by the commissioner prior
to August 1. The appeal is not subject to either chapter 14 or section 270C.92. The commissioner
must issue an appropriate order to the county assessor in response to each timely appeal, either
upholding or changing the valuation or classification of the property. Prior to October 1 of each
year, the commissioner must charge and bill the county where the property is located $500 for each
tax parcel covered by an order issued under this paragraph in that year. Amounts received by the
commissioner under this paragraph must be deposited in the state's general fund. If payment of a
billed amount is not received by the commissioner before December 1 of the year when billed, the
commissioner must deduct that unpaid amount from any state aid the commissioner would otherwise
pay to the county under chapter 477A in the next year. Late payments may either be returned to the
county uncashed and undeposited or may be accepted. If a late payment is accepted, the state aid paid
to the county under chapter 477A must be adjusted within 12 months to eliminate any reduction that
occurred because the payment was late. Amounts needed to make these adjustments are included in
the appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.

    Subd. 34. City revenue need. (a) For a city with a population equal to or greater than 2,500,
"city revenue need" is the greater of 285 or the sum of (1) 5.0734098 times the pre-1940 housing
percentage; plus (2) 19.141678 times the population decline percentage; plus (3) 2504.06334 times
the road accidents factor; plus (4) 355.0547; minus (5) the metropolitan area factor; minus (6)
49.10638 times the household size.
    (b) For a city with a population less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) 2.387 times
the pre-1940 housing percentage; plus (2) 2.67591 times the commercial industrial percentage;
plus (3) 3.16042 times the population decline percentage; plus (4) 1.206 times the transformed
population; minus (5) 62.772.
    (c) For a city with a population of 2,500 or more and a population in one of the most recently
available five years that was less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) its city revenue
need calculated under paragraph (a) multiplied by its transition factor; plus (2) its city revenue
need calculated under the formula in paragraph (b) multiplied by the difference between one and its
transition factor. For purposes of this paragraph, a city's "transition factor" is equal to 0.2 multiplied
by the number of years that the city's population estimate has been 2,500 or more. This provision
only applies for aids payable in calendar years 2006 to 2008 to cities with a 2002 population of
less than 2,500. It applies to any city for aids payable in 2009 and thereafter. T ­­h­ c­t

   (d) The city revenue need cannot be less than zero.
    (e) For calendar year 2005 and subsequent years, the city revenue need for a city, as determined
in paragraphs (a) to (d), is multiplied by the ratio of the annual implicit price deflator for government
consumption expenditures and gross investment for state and local governments as prepared by the
United States Department of Commerce, for the most recently available year to the 2003 implicit
price deflator for state and local government purchases.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 477A.011, subdivision 42, is amended to read:
    Subd. 42. City jobs base. (a) "City jobs base" for a city with a population of 5,000 or more is
equal to the product of (1) $25.20, (2) the number of jobs per capita in the city, and (3) its population.
For cities with a population less than 5,000, the city jobs base is equal to zero. For a city receiving
aid under subdivision 36, paragraph ­ (­)
                                       l­ (k), its city jobs base is reduced by the lesser of 36 percent of
the amount of aid received under that paragraph or $1,000,000. No city's city jobs base may exceed
$4,725,000 under this paragraph.
    (b) For calendar year 2010 and subsequent years, the city jobs base for a city, as determined in
paragraph (a), is multiplied by the ratio of the appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a,
for the year in which the aid is paid to the appropriation under that section for aids payable in 2009.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "jobs per capita in the city" means (1) the average annual
number of employees in the city based on the data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and
Wages, as reported by the Department of Employment and Economic Development, for the most
recent calendar year available as of May 1, 2008, divided by (2) the city's population for the same
calendar year as the employment data. The commissioner of the Department of Employment and
Economic Development shall certify to the city the average annual number of employees for each

city by June 1, 2008. A city may challenge an estimate under this paragraph by filing its specific
objection, including the names of employers that it feels may have misreported data, in writing
with the commissioner by June 20, 2008. The commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to
address the specific objection and adjust the data as necessary. The commissioner shall certify the
estimates of the annual employment to the commissioner of revenue by July 15, 2008, including
any estimates still under objection.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 477A.013, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. City formula aid. (a) In calendar year 2009, the formula aid for a city is equal to
the sum of (1) its city jobs base, (2) its small city aid base, and (3) the need increase percentage
multiplied by its unmet need.
    (b) In calendar year 2010 and subsequent years, the formula aid for a city is equal to the sum of
(1) its city jobs base, (2) its small city aid base, and (3) the need increase percentage multiplied by
the average of its unmet need for the most recently available two years.
No city may have a formula aid amount less than zero. The need increase percentage must be the
same for all cities.
    The applicable need increase percentage must be calculated by the Department of Revenue so
that the total of the aid under subdivision 9 equals the total amount available for aid under section
477A.03. For aids payable in 2009 only, all data used in calculating aid to cities under sections
477A.011 to 477A.013 will be based on the data available for calculating aid to cities for aids payable
in 2008. For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, data used in calculating aids to cities under sections
477A.011 to 477A.013 shall be the most recently available data as of January 1 in the year in which
the aid is calculated except as provided in section 477A.011, subdivisions 3 and 35.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessment year 2009 and thereafter.

ownership should be retained and managed for public benefits while other lands should be returned
to private ownership. Parcels of land becoming the property of the state in trust under law declaring
the forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes must be classified by the county board of the county

particular purposes. In making the classification the board shall consider the present use of adjacent
lands, the productivity of the soil, the character of forest or other growth, accessibility of lands
to established roads, schools, and other public services, their peculiar suitability or desirability
for particular uses, and the suitability of the forest resources on the land for multiple use,   ­ and
sustained yield management. The classification, furthermore, must encourage and foster a mode of
land utilization that will facilitate the economical and adequate provision of transportation, roads,
water supply, drainage, sanitation, education, and recreation; facilitate reduction of governmental
expenditures; conserve and develop the natural resources; and foster and develop agriculture and
other industries in the districts and places best suited to them.

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
    (c) Prior to meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided
that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
2636                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [38TH DAY

14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site under
the procedures in section 331A.12. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to each
person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided in
chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this
paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities at the meeting.
    (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent
information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay
taking action on any parcel or parcels.
    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:

                                      l­y­ to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state
agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land is withheld
from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted to the
county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease to any
other party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding period to
the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision of the state,
the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county during the
period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to the requesting
party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting party terminates
the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property ­
                                                                                         o­r.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application ­
                         o­f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than

their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
     (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because
(i) a reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make
the lands undesirable in the open market, or (ii) the reduced price will lead to the development of
affordable housing; and
    (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented (i) its specific plans for
correcting the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and (ii) the specific law or
laws that empower it to acquire real property in furtherance of such plans.
      (e) Nonconservation tax-forfeited land held in trust in favor of the taxing districts may be
conveyed by the commissioner of revenue m                   ­­ay­­­­

recommendation of the county board. An authorized public use under this paragraph is a use that
either (i) allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property in
numbers appropriate to its size and use, or (ii) is for a public service facility. Authorized public
uses as defined in this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, ball fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit ways for buses or commuter trains;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water tower, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
    (f) The commissioner of revenue must convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the board that
prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development agreement,
but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required
for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state

for less than its market value for either: (i) creation or preservation of wetlands, (ii) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan, or (iii) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed in such case must contain a restrictive
covenant limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is
reconveyed back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the
property to the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval
by the commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall
be refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph
may be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d).

       Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Deed of conveyance; form; approvals. The deed of conveyance for property
conveyed for ­a an authorized public use under the authorities in subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), must
be on a form approved by the attorney general and must be conditioned on continued use for the
purpose stated in the application as provided in this section. These deeds are conditional use deeds
that convey a defeasible estate. Reversion of the estate occurs by operation of law and without the
requirement for any affirmative act by, or on behalf of the state when there is a failure to put the
property to the approved authorized public use for which it was conveyed, or an abandonment of
that use; except as provided in subdivision 1d.

purposes of this paragraph, there is no failure to put the land to the authorized public use and no
abandonment of that use if a formal plan of the governmental subdivision shows an intended future
use of the land for the authorized public use.
    (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue after January 1, 2006, may be acquired by that
governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the conveyance if the commissioner
determines upon written application from the subdivision that, the subdivision has in fact put the
property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed, and the subdivision has made a
finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Prior to conveying the property,
the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land is located objects to a
conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without further act by or
obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the commissioner
makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on behalf of the
state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For purposes of this
paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in a formal plan
of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.

    (b) The county board may, by resolution duly adopted, resolve that certain lands classified as
conservation lands shall be devoted to conservation uses and may submit such resolution to the
commissioner of natural resources. If, upon investigation, the commissioner of natural resources
determines that the lands covered by such resolution, or any part thereof, can be managed and
developed for conservation purposes, the commissioner shall make a certificate describing the lands
and reciting the acceptance thereof on behalf of the state for such purposes. The commissioner shall
transmit the certificate to the county auditor, who shall note the same upon the auditor's records and
record the same with the county recorder. The title to all lands so accepted shall be held by the state
free from any trust in favor of any and all taxing districts and such lands shall be devoted thereafter
to the purposes of forestry, water conservation, flood control, parks, game refuges, controlled game
management areas, public shooting grounds, or other public recreational or conservation uses, and
managed, controlled, and regulated for such purposes under the jurisdiction of the commissioner of
natural resources and the divisions of the department.
   (c) All proceeds derived from the sale of timber, lease of hay stumpage, or other revenue from
such lands under the jurisdiction of the commissioner of natural resources shall be paid into the
general fund of the state.

in the same manner as provided in section 282.04.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonconservation lands; appraisal and sale. (a) All parcels of land classified as
nonconservation, except those which may be reserved, shall be sold as provided, if it is determined,
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie, that it is advisable to do so, having in
mind their accessibility, their proximity to existing public improvements, and the effect of their
sale and occupancy on the public burdens. Any parcels of land proposed to be sold shall be first
appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
    (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall
submit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the first publication of the list of lands to be
offered for sale a list of all lands included on the list which are situated outside of any incorporated
municipality. If, at any time before the opening of the sale, the commissioner notifies the county
auditor in writing that there is standing timber on any parcel of such land, the parcel shall not be
sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
    (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until

the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                                   I­

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only
(1) a payment of at least ten percent of the purchase price must be made at the time of purchase, and
the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber
or timber products must not be removed from these lands until an amount equal to the appraised
value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid
by the purchaser. If a parcel of land bearing standing timber or timber products is sold at public
auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the
excess bid allocated to timber or timber products has been paid in addition to the appraised value of
the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is
applicable. Interest on the unpaid contract balance on sales occurring before July 1, 1982, is payable
at the rate applicable to the sale at the time that the sale occurred.

      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:

shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are
sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as
provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. City sales; alternate procedures. Land located in a home rule charter or statutory
city, or in a town which cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local ordinances
regarding minimum area, shape, frontage or access may be sold by the county auditor pursuant to
this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics
of the land indicate that its highest and best use will be achieved by combining it with an adjoining
parcel and the city or town has not adopted a local ordinance governing minimum area, shape,
frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists

    (4) anyone who provides, or assists in providing, tax preparation services within the scope of
duties as an employee or supervisor of a person who is exempt under this subdivision.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.56, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedure for assessment; claims for refunds. (a) The commissioner may assess
liability for the taxes described in subdivision 1 against a person liable under this section. The
assessment may be based upon information available to the commissioner. It must be made within
the prescribed period of limitations for assessing the underlying tax, or within one year after the date
of an order assessing underlying tax, whichever period expires later. An order assessing personal
liability under this section is reviewable under section 270C.35 and is appealable to Tax Court.
    (b) If the time for appealing the order has expired and a payment is made by or collected from the
person assessed on the order in excess of the amount lawfully due from that person of any portion
of the liability shown on the order, a claim for refund may be made by that person within 120 days
after any payment of the liability if the payment is within three and one-half years after the date the
order was issued. Claims for refund under this paragraph are limited to the amount paid during the
120-day period. Any amounts collected under paragraph (c) after a claim for refund is filed in order
to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment that is the subject of the claim will be returned if the
claim is allowed. There is no claim for refund available under this paragraph if the assessment has
previously been the subject of an administrative or Tax Court appeal, or a denied claim for refund.
The taxpayer may contest denial of the refund as provided in the procedures governing claims for
refunds under section 289A.50, subdivision 7.
    (c) If a person has been assessed under this section for an amount for a given period and the
time for appeal has expired, regardless of whether an action contesting denial of a claim for refund
has been filed under paragraph (b), or there has been a final determination that the person is liable,
collection action is not stayed pursuant to section 270C.33, subdivision 5, for that assessment or for
subsequent assessments of additional amounts for the same person for the same period and tax type.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for orders issued after the date of final enactment.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 287.08, is amended to read:
    287.08 TAX, HOW PAYABLE; RECEIPTS.
    (a) The tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12 must be paid to the treasurer of any county in
this state in which the real property or some part is located at or before the time of filing the mortgage
for record. The treasurer shall endorse receipt on the mortgage and the receipt is conclusive proof that
the tax has been paid in the amount stated and authorizes any county recorder or registrar of titles to
record the mortgage. Its form, in substance, shall be "registration tax hereon of ..................... dollars
paid." If the mortgage is exempt from taxation the endorsement shall, in substance, be "exempt from
registration tax." In either case the receipt must be signed by the treasurer. In case the treasurer is
unable to determine whether a claim of exemption should be allowed, the tax must be paid as in
the case of a taxable mortgage. For documents submitted electronically, the endorsements and tax
amount shall be affixed electronically and no signature by the treasurer will be required. The actual
payment method must be arranged in advance between the submitter and the receiving county.
     (b) The county treasurer may refund in whole or in part any mortgage registry tax overpayment
if a written application by the taxpayer is submitted to the county treasurer within 3-1/2 years from
2654                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [38TH DAY

the date of the overpayment. If the county has not issued a denial of the application, the taxpayer
may bring an action in Tax Court in the county in which the tax was paid at any time after the
expiration of six months from the time that the application was submitted. A denial of refund may
be appealed within 60 days from the date of the denial by bringing an action in Tax Court in the
county in which the tax was paid. The action is commenced by the serving of a petition for relief
on the county treasurer, and by filing a copy with the court. The county attorney shall defend the
action. The county treasurer shall notify the treasurer of each county that has or would receive a
portion of the tax as paid.
    (c) If the county treasurer determines a refund should be paid, or if a refund is ordered by the
court, the county treasurer of each county that actually received a portion of the tax shall immediately
pay a proportionate share of three percent of the refund using any available county funds. The county
treasurer of each county that received, or would have received, a portion of the tax shall also pay
their county's proportionate share of the remaining 97 percent of the court-ordered refund on or
before the 20th day of the following month using solely the mortgage registry tax funds that would
be paid to the commissioner of revenue on that date under section 287.12. If the funds on hand
under this procedure are insufficient to fully fund 97 percent of the court-ordered refund, the county
treasurer of the county in which the action was brought shall file a claim with the commissioner of
revenue under section 16A.48 for the remaining portion of 97 percent of the refund, and shall pay
over the remaining portion upon receipt of a warrant from the state issued pursuant to the claim.
    (d) When any mortgage covers real property located in more than one county in this state the total
tax must be paid to the treasurer of the county where the mortgage is first presented for recording,
and the payment must be receipted as provided in paragraph (a). If the principal debt or obligation
secured by such a multiple county mortgage exceeds $    ­­1­0 00

of the tax must be divided and paid over by the county treasurer receiving it, on or before the 20th
day of each month after receipt, to the county or counties entitled in the ratio that the market value
of the real property covered by the mortgage in each county bears to the market value of all the
real property in this state described in the mortgage. In making the division and payment the county
treasurer shall send a statement giving the description of the real property described in the mortgage
and the market value of the part located in each county. For this purpose, the treasurer of any county
may require the treasurer of any other county to certify to the former the market valuation of any
tract of real property in any mortgage.
    (e) The mortgagor must pay the tax imposed by sections 287.01 to 287.12. The mortgagee may
undertake to collect and remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor. If the mortgagee collects money
from the mortgagor to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a fiduciary duty
to remit the tax on behalf of the mortgagor as to the amount of the tax collected for that purpose and
the mortgagor is relieved of any further obligation to pay the tax as to the amount collected by the
mortgagee for this purpose.

in this chapter shall have the following meanings:
    (1) "Federal gross estate" means the gross estate of a decedent as valued and otherwise
determined for federal estate tax purposes by federal taxing authorities pursuant to the provisions

of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (2) "Minnesota gross estate" means the federal gross estate of a decedent after (a) excluding
therefrom any property included therein which has its situs outside Minnesota, and (b) including
therein any property omitted from the federal gross estate which is includable therein, has its situs
in Minnesota, and was not disclosed to federal taxing authorities.
    (3) "Personal representative" means the executor, administrator or other person appointed
by the court to administer and dispose of the property of the decedent. If there is no executor,
administrator or other person appointed, qualified, and acting within this state, then any person in
actual or constructive possession of any property having a situs in this state which is included in
the federal gross estate of the decedent shall be deemed to be a personal representative to the extent
of the property and the Minnesota estate tax due with respect to the property.
   (4) "Resident decedent" means an individual whose domicile at the time of death was in
Minnesota.
   (5) "Nonresident decedent" means an individual whose domicile at the time of death was not in
Minnesota.
    (6) "Situs of property" means, with respect to real property, the state or country in which it is
located; with respect to tangible personal property, the state or country in which it was normally
kept or located at the time of the decedent's death; and with respect to intangible personal property,
the state or country in which the decedent was domiciled at death. For a nonresident decedent with
an ownership interest in a pass-through entity with assets that include real or tangible personal
property, situs of the real or tangible personal property is determined as if the pass-through entity
does not exist and the real or tangible personal property is personally owned by the decedent. If the
pass-through entity is owned by a person or persons in addition to the decedent, ownership of the
property is attributed to the decedent in proportion to the decedent's capital ownership share of the
pass-through entity.
   (7) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of revenue or any person to whom the
commissioner has delegated functions under this chapter.
   (8) "Internal Revenue Code" means the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended through February 13, 2008.
    (9) "Minnesota adjusted taxable estate" means federal adjusted taxable estate as defined by
section 2011(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, increased by the amount of deduction for state
death taxes allowed under section 2058 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (10) "Pass-through entity" includes the following:
   (i) an entity electing S corporation status under section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code;
   (ii) an entity taxed as a partnership under subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (iii) a single member limited liability company or similar entity, regardless of whether it is
taxed as an association or is disregarded for federal income tax purposes under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 26, section 301.7701-3; or
   (iv) a trust.
