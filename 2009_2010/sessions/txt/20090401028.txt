members, partners, or shareholders either resides on the land or actively operates the land; and
    (3) corporations that derive 80 percent or more of their gross receipts from the wholesale or
retail sale of horticultural or nursery stock.
       The terms in this paragraph have the meanings given in section 500.24, where applicable.
    (c) Land that previously qualified for tax deferment under this section and no longer qualifies
because it is not primarily used for agricultural purposes but would otherwise qualify under
Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 3, for a period of at least three years will
not be required to make payment of the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding the provisions
of subdivision 9. Sale of the land prior to the expiration of the three-year period requires payment
of deferred taxes as follows: sale in the year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the
current year's deferred taxes plus payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years; sale during
the second year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes
plus payment of the deferred taxes for the prior year; and sale during the third year the land no
longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes shall be paid
even if the land qualifies pursuant to subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or no longer
qualifies under this paragraph, or at the end of the three-year period, whichever comes first, all
deferred special assessments plus interest are payable in equal installments spread over the time
remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued to finance the improvement for which the
assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred special assessments plus interest
are payable within 90 days. The provisions of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to the collection
of these installments. Penalties are not imposed on any such special assessments if timely paid.

    (c) If land described in paragraph (a) is sold or otherwise transferred to a son or daughter of the
owner, it will continue to qualify for treatment under this section as long as it continues to meet the
requirements of Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 3, but no later than the 2013
assessment.
    (d) When property assessed under this subdivision is removed from the program and is enrolled
in the rural preserve property tax law program under section 273.114, the property is not subject to
the additional taxes required under this subdivision or subdivision 9.

       Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Additional taxes. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), when real property which is
being, or has been valued and assessed under this section no longer qualifies under subdivision
3, the portion no longer qualifying shall be subject to additional taxes, in the amount equal to
the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision 4, and the amount

determined under subdivision 5. Provided, however, that the amount determined under subdivision
5 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property
at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision
5. Such additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the current year,
provided, however, that no interest or penalties shall be levied on such additional taxes if timely
paid, and provided further, that such additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the last
three years that the said property has been valued and assessed under this section.
   (b) Real property that has been valued and assessed under this section prior to May 29, 2008,
and that ceases to qualify under this section after May 28, 2008, and is withdrawn from the program
before May 1, 2010, is not subject to additional taxes under this subdivision or subdivision 3,
paragraph (c). If additional taxes have been paid under this subdivision with respect to property
described in this paragraph prior to the date of enactment of this act, the county must repay the
property owner in the manner prescribed by the commissioner of revenue.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.111, subdivision 11a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11a. Continuation of tax treatment upon sale or other events. (a) When real property
qualifying under subdivision 3 is sold or transferred, no additional taxes or deferred special
assessments plus interest shall be extended against the property provided the property continues to
qualify pursuant to subdivision 3, and provided the new owner files an application for continued
deferment within 30 days after the sale or transfer.
   (b) The following transfers do not constitute a change of ownership of property qualifying under
subdivision 3:
    (1) death of a property owner when a surviving owner retains ownership of the property
thereafter;
    (2) divorce of a married couple when one of the spouses retains ownership of the property
thereafter;
  (3) marriage of a single property owner when that owner retains ownership of the property in
whole or in part thereafter;
  (4) organization into or reorganization of a farm entity ownership under section 500.24, if all
owners maintain the same beneficial interest both before and after the organizational changes; and
    (5) placement of the property in trust provided that the individual owners of the property are the
grantors of the trust and they maintain the same beneficial interest both before and after placement
of the property in trust.

conservation district providing a framework for site-specific healthy, productive, and sustainable
conservation resources. A conservation management plan must include at least the following:
   (1) conservation management goals for the land;
   (2) a reliable field inventory of the individual conservation practices and cover types;
   (3) a description of the soil type and quality;
    (4) an aerial photo or map of the vegetation and other natural features of the land clearly
indicating the boundaries of the conservation land;
   (5) the proposed future conditions of the land;
   (6) prescriptions to meet proposed future conditions of the land;
   (7) a recommended timetable for implementing the prescribed practices; and
   (8) a legal description of the land encompassing the parcels included in the plan.
   (c) The Board of Water and Soil Resources shall develop and distribute guidance for
conservation management plan preparation and approval.
   (d) The commissioner of revenue is the final arbiter of disputes arising over plan approvals.
    Subd. 2. Requirements. Class 2a or 2b property that had been assessed under Minnesota Statutes
2006, section 273.111, or that is part of an agricultural homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a), is entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this section if:
   (1) the land consists of at least ten acres;
    (2) a conservation management plan for the land must be prepared by an approved plan writer
and implemented during the period in which the land is subject to valuation and deferment under
this section;
   (3) the land must be enrolled for a minimum of ten years; and
   (4) there are no delinquent property taxes on the land.
   Real estate may not be enrolled for valuation and deferment under this section and section
273.111, 273.112, or 273.117, or chapter 290C concurrently.
   No more than 50 percent of the total acreage of an agricultural homestead may be class 2b
property enrolled in this program.
    Subd. 3. Determination of value. Notwithstanding sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11,
the value of any real estate that qualifies under subdivision 2 must, upon timely application
by the owner in the manner provided in subdivision 5, not exceed the value prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue for class 2a tillable property in that county. The house and garage, if any,
and the immediately surrounding one acre of land and a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure, if
any, shall be valued according to their appropriate value. In determining the value for ad valorem
tax purposes, the assessor shall not consider the presence of commercial, industrial, residential,
or seasonal recreational land use influences that may affect the value of real estate subject to this
section.
28TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009                                        1249

    Subd. 4. Separate determination of market value and tax. The assessor shall make a separate
determination of the market value of the real estate based on its highest and best use. The tax based
upon that value and the appropriate local tax rate applicable to the property in the taxing district
shall be recorded on the property assessment records.
    Subd. 5. Application and covenant agreement. (a) Application for deferment of taxes and
assessment under this section shall be filed by May 1 of the year prior to the year in which the
taxes are payable. Any application filed under this subdivision and granted shall continue in effect
for subsequent years until the termination of the covenant agreement under paragraph (b). The
application must be filed with the assessor of the taxing district in which the real property is located
on the form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue. The assessor may require proof by affidavit
or otherwise that the property qualifies under subdivision 2.
    (b) The owner of the property must sign a covenant agreement that is filed with the county
recorder and recorded in the county where the property is located. The covenant agreement must
include all of the following:
   (1) legal description of the area to which the covenant applies;
   (2) name and address of the owner;
   (3) a statement that the land described in the covenant must be kept as rural preserve land, which
meets the requirements of subdivision 2, for the duration of the covenant;
    (4) a statement that the landowner may terminate the covenant agreement by notifying the county
assessor in writing five years in advance of the date of proposed termination, provided that the notice
of intent to terminate may not be given at any time before the land has been subject to the covenant
for a period of five years;
   (5) a statement that the covenant is binding on the owner or the owner's successor or assigns and
runs with the land; and
    (6) a witnessed signature of the owner, agreeing by covenant, to maintain the land as described
in subdivision 2.
    (c) After a covenant under this section has been terminated, the land that had been subject to the
covenant is ineligible for subsequent valuation under this section for a period of three years after
the termination.
    Subd. 6. Additional taxes. Upon termination of a covenant agreement in subdivision 5,
paragraph (b), the land to which the covenant applied shall be subject to additional taxes in the
amount equal to the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with subdivision
3 and the amount determined under subdivision 4, provided that the amount determined under
subdivision 4 shall not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the
real property at an arm's-length transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under
subdivision 4. The additional taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the
current year, provided that no interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if timely
paid and that the additional taxes shall only be levied with respect to the current year plus two prior
years that the property has been valued and assessed under this section.
   Subd. 7. Lien. The additional tax imposed by this section shall be a lien upon the property

assessed to the same extent and for the same duration as other taxes imposed on the property in this
state. The tax shall be annually extended by the county auditor and if and when payable shall be
collected and distributed in the manner provided by law for the collection and distribution of other
property taxes.
     Subd. 8. Special local assessments. The payment of special local assessments levied after
June 1, 2011, for improvements made to any real property described in subdivision 1 together with
the interest thereon shall, on timely application as provided in subdivision 6, be deferred as long
as the property meets the conditions contained in this section. If special assessments against the
property have been deferred pursuant to this subdivision, the governmental unit shall file with the
county recorder in the county in which the property is located a certificate containing the legal
description of the affected property and of the amount deferred. When the property no longer
qualifies under subdivision 1, all deferred special assessments plus interest shall be payable in
equal installments spread over the time remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued
to finance the improvement for which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured,
the deferred special assessments plus interest shall be payable within 90 days. The provisions
of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to the collection of these installments. Penalty shall not
be levied on these special assessments if timely paid. This subdivision does not apply to special
assessments levied at any time by a county or district court under chapter 116A or by a watershed
district under chapter 103D.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for deferred taxes payable in 2012 and thereafter.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property m   ­­ay
                                                                                                    ­

with class 2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting
ditches, ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is
impractical for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to
be able to be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
   (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
28TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009                                        1251

with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor to receive the reduced class rate and provide the information required by
the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate. The commissioner of natural
resources must concur that the land is qualified. The commissioner of natural resources shall
annually provide county assessors verification information on a timely basis.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
    (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
1252                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [28TH DAY

   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or
cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
   The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
28TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009                                        1253

homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (k) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (l) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being mined
and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b. It has a class rate of one percent of market value.
To qualify for classification under this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres
in size and the owner of the property must record with the county recorder of the county in which
the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.

    (m) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessments in 2010 for taxes payable in
2011, and thereafter.

  84.0273 ESTABLISHMENT OF BOUNDARY LINES RELATING TO CERTAIN STATE
LANDHOLDINGS.
    (a) In order to resolve boundary line issues affecting the ownership interests of the state and
adjacent landowners, the commissioner of natural resources may, in the name of the state upon
terms the commissioner deems appropriate, convey, by a boundary line agreement, quitclaim
deed, or management agreement in such form as the attorney general approves, such rights, titles,
and interests of the state in state lands for such rights, titles and interests in adjacent lands as
are necessary for the purpose of establishing boundaries. A notice of the proposed conveyance
and a brief statement of the reason therefor shall be published once in the State Register by
the commissioner between 15 and 30 days prior to conveyance. The provisions of this ­         s­ t­o

lands not needed for natural resource purposes at private sale to adjoining property owners and
leaseholders. The conveyance must be by quitclaim in a form approved by the attorney general for
a consideration not less than the value determined according to section 94.10, subdivision 1.
    (c) Paragraph (b) applies to all state-owned lands managed by the commissioner of natural
resources, except school trust land as defined in section 92.025. For acquired lands, the
commissioner may sell the surplus lands as provided in paragraph (b) notwithstanding the offering
to public entities, public sale, and related notice and publication requirements of sections 94.09
to 94.165. For consolidated conservation lands, the commissioner may sell the surplus lands as
provided in paragraph (b) notwithstanding the classification and public sale provisions of chapters
84A and 282.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Timber sales; land leases and uses. (a) The county auditor may sell timber upon
any tract that may be approved by the natural resources commissioner. The sale of timber shall be
made for cash at not less than the appraised value determined by the county board to the highest
bidder after not less than one week's published notice in an official paper within the county. Any
timber offered at the public sale and not sold may thereafter be sold at private sale by the county
auditor at not less than the appraised value thereof, until the time as the county board may withdraw
the timber from sale. The appraised value of the timber and the forestry practices to be followed in
the cutting of said timber shall be approved by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (b) Payment of the full sale price of all timber sold on tax-forfeited lands shall be made in cash at
the time of the timber sale, except in the case of oral or sealed bid auction sales, the down payment
shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised value, and the balance shall be paid prior to entry.
In the case of auction sales that are partitioned and sold as a single sale with predetermined cutting
blocks, the down payment shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised price of the entire timber
sale which may be held until the satisfactory completion of the sale or applied in whole or in part
to the final cutting block. The value of each separate block must be paid in full before any cutting
may begin in that block. With the permission of the county contract administrator the purchaser
may enter unpaid blocks and cut necessary timber incidental to developing logging roads as may
be needed to log other blocks provided that no timber may be removed from an unpaid block until
separately scaled and paid for. If payment is provided as specified in this paragraph as security
under paragraph (a) and no cutting has taken place on the contract, the county auditor may credit
the security provided, less any down payment required for an auction sale under this paragraph, to
any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under this chapter to which the contract
holder requests in writing that it be credited, provided the request and transfer is made within the
same calendar year as the security was received.
    (c) The county board may sell any timber, including biomass, as appraised or scaled. Any parcels
of land from which timber is to be sold by scale of cut products shall be so designated in the published
notice of sale under paragraph (a), in which case the notice shall contain a description of the parcels,
a statement of the estimated quantity of each species of timber, and the appraised price of each
species of timber for 1,000 feet, per cord or per piece, as the case may be. In those cases any bids
offered over and above the appraised prices shall be by percentage, the percent bid to be added to
the appraised price of each of the different species of timber advertised on the land. The purchaser
of timber from the parcels shall pay in cash at the time of sale at the rate bid for all of the timber
shown in the notice of sale as estimated to be standing on the land, and in addition shall pay at the
1258                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [28TH DAY

same rate for any additional amounts which the final scale shows to have been cut or was available
for cutting on the land at the time of sale under the terms of the sale. Where the final scale of cut
products shows that less timber was cut or was available for cutting under terms of the sale than
was originally paid for, the excess payment shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon
the claim of the purchaser, to be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims
against the county. No timber, except hardwood pulpwood, may be removed from the parcels of land
or other designated landings until scaled by a person or persons designated by the county board and
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. Landings other than the parcel of land from
which timber is cut may be designated for scaling by the county board by written agreement with
the purchaser of the timber. The county board may, by written agreement with the purchaser and
with a consumer designated by the purchaser when the timber is sold by the county auditor, and with
the approval of the commissioner of natural resources, accept the consumer's scale of cut products
delivered at the consumer's landing. No timber shall be removed until fully paid for in cash. Small
amounts of timber not exceeding $3,000 in appraised valuation may be sold for not less than the full
appraised value at private sale to individual persons without first publishing notice of sale or calling
for bids, provided that in case of a sale involving a total appraised value of more than $200 the sale
shall be made subject to final settlement on the basis of a scale of cut products in the manner above
provided and not more than two of the sales, directly or indirectly to any individual shall be in effect
at one time.
    (d) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, and at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for use as cottage and camp sites
and for agricultural purposes and for the purpose of taking and removing of hay, stumpage, sand,
gravel, clay, rock, marl, and black dirt from the land, and for garden sites and other temporary uses
provided that no leases shall be for a period to exceed ten years; provided, further that any leases
involving a consideration of more than $12,000 per year, except to an organized subdivision of the
state shall first be offered at public sale in the manner provided herein for sale of timber. Upon
the sale of any leased land, it shall remain subject to the lease for not to exceed one year from the
beginning of the term of the lease. Any rent paid by the lessee for the portion of the term cut off by
the cancellation shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the lessee, to
be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county.
    (e) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations, or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for the purpose of taking and
removing for use for road construction and other purposes tax-forfeited stockpiled iron-bearing
material. The county auditor must determine that the material is needed and suitable for use in
the construction or maintenance of a road, tailings basin, settling basin, dike, dam, bank fill, or
other works on public or private property, and that the use would be in the best interests of the
public. No lease shall exceed ten years. The use of a stockpile for these purposes must first be
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. The request shall be deemed approved unless
the requesting county is notified to the contrary by the commissioner of natural resources within
six months after receipt of a request for approval for use of a stockpile. Once use of a stockpile has
been approved, the county may continue to lease it for these purposes until approval is withdrawn
by the commissioner of natural resources.
   (f) The county auditor, with the approval of the county board is authorized to grant permits,
28TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009                                         1259

licenses, and leases to tax-forfeited lands for the depositing of stripping, lean ores, tailings, or waste
products from mines or ore milling plants, or to use for facilities needed to recover iron-bearing
oxides from tailings basins or stockpiles, or for a buffer area needed for a mining operation, upon
the conditions and for the consideration and for the period of time, not exceeding ­      15­ 25 years, as
the county board may determine. The permits, licenses, or leases are subject to approval by the
commissioner of natural resources.
    (g) Any person who removes any timber from tax-forfeited land before said timber has been
scaled and fully paid for as provided in this subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (h) The county auditor may, with the approval of the county board, and without first offering
at public sale, grant leases, for a term not exceeding 25 years, for the removal of peat and for
the production or removal of farm-grown closed-loop biomass as defined in section 216B.2424,
subdivision 1, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands upon the terms and conditions
as the county board may prescribe. Any lease for the removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop
biomass, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands must first be reviewed and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources if the lease covers 320 or more acres. No lease for the
removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop biomass, or short-rotation woody crops shall be made by
the county auditor pursuant to this section without first holding a public hearing on the auditor's
intention to lease. One printed notice in a legal newspaper in the county at least ten days before the
hearing, and posted notice in the courthouse at least 20 days before the hearing shall be given of the
hearing.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c) to the contrary, the St. Louis County auditor
may, at the discretion of the county board, sell timber to the party who bids the highest price for all
the several kinds of timber, as provided for sales by the commissioner of natural resources under
section 90.14. Bids offered over and above the appraised price need not be applied proportionately
to the appraised price of each of the different species of timber.
    (j) In lieu of any payment or deposit required in paragraph (b), as directed by the county board
and under terms set by the county board, the county auditor may accept an irrevocable bank letter
of credit in the amount equal to the amount otherwise determined in paragraph (b). If an irrevocable
bank letter of credit is provided under this paragraph, at the written request of the purchaser, the
county may periodically allow the bank letter of credit to be reduced by an amount proportionate
to the value of timber that has been harvested and for which the county has received payment. The
remaining amount of the bank letter of credit after a reduction under this paragraph must not be less
than 20 percent of the value of the timber purchased. If an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash
deposit is provided for the down payment required in paragraph (b), and no cutting of timber has
taken place on the contract for which a letter of credit has been provided, the county may allow the
transfer of the letter of credit to any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under
this chapter to which the contract holder requests in writing that it be credited.

   Subdivision 1. Review and approval; monitoring. (a) The commissioner of health shall review
and authorize contracts and business or financial arrangements under section 62R.06, subdivision 1,
and any modification, renewal, or extension of a contract or business or financial arrangement that
previously has been approved. All contracts and business or financial arrangements, modifications,
renewals, or extensions must be submitted on an application for approval to the commissioner.
    (b) Within 30 days after receiving an application, the commissioner may request additional
information that is necessary to complete the review required under this section. The commissioner
must approve or deny an application within 60 days after receiving the application or within 60 days
after receiving any additional information requested by the commissioner, whichever is later. The
commissioner must not deny an application unless the commissioner determines, using the criteria
in paragraph (g), that: (1) the anticompetitive effects of the arrangement on the marketplace exceed
the procompetitive effects or efficiencies, or that any price agreements included in the arrangement
are not necessary to achieve the efficiencies that are expected to result from the arrangement; or
   (2) the applicant has not provided complete or sufficient information requested by the
commissioner to evaluate the impact of the proposed arrangement on the health care marketplace.
    (c) The commissioner may collect information from other persons to assist in evaluating the
impact of the proposed arrangement on the health care marketplace. The commissioner shall collect
information from health plan companies and health care providers operating in the same geographic
area as the health care cooperative. Data collected from health plan companies and health care
providers under this paragraph are nonpublic data or private data on individuals, as defined in section
13.02.
   (d) The commissioner may solicit public comment on the impact of the proposed arrangement.
    (e) The commissioner may condition approval of a proposed arrangement on a modification
of all or part of the arrangement to eliminate any restriction on competition that is not reasonably
related to the goals of improving health care access or quality. The commissioner may also establish
conditions for approval that are reasonably necessary to protect against abuses of private economic
power and to ensure that the arrangement has oversight by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall actively monitor arrangements approved under this section to ensure
that the arrangement remains in compliance with the conditions of approval. Upon request, the
health care cooperative shall provide information to the commissioner regarding compliance. The
commissioner may revoke an approval upon a finding that the arrangement is not in substantial
compliance with the terms of the application or the conditions of approval.
   (g) In evaluating applications received under this section, the commissioner shall consider
whether:
   (1) the arrangement is likely to produce significant efficiencies that benefit consumers, such as
cost savings or improvements in quality of or access to care;
   (2) the arrangement is likely to have any anticompetitive effects on the marketplace; and
    (3) the potential anticompetitive effects outweigh the procompetitive efficiencies resulting from
the arrangement.

description of the proposed arrangement.
   (b) The application must include:
   (1) the identities of all the parties to the arrangement;
    (2) the participation rules for the cooperative, including the terms and conditions under which
participating providers may be members of the cooperative;
   (3) a description of the geographic areas served by the cooperative and the products provided,
and a list of competing providers that are not members of the cooperative;
   (4) a description of any restriction on participating members of the cooperative entering into
other contracts with payers; and
   (5) a description of the increased efficiency, improved health care access, improved health care
quality, or increased market competition that will result from the arrangement.
    (c) Data on providers collected under this section are private data on individuals or nonpublic
data, as defined in section 13.02.
    Subd. 3. Application fee. When submitting an initial application to the commissioner, a health
care cooperative shall pay a fee of $2,000 for the commissioner's cost of reviewing and monitoring
the arrangement. When submitting an application for modification, renewal, or extension of a
previously approved contract and business or financial arrangement, the health care cooperative
shall pay a fee of $500. Revenue received by the commissioner under this section is appropriated
to the commissioner for the purpose of administering this section."

specifically authorized access to that data by state, local, or federal law enacted or promulgated
after the collection of the data.
   (c) Private or confidential data may be used and disseminated to individuals or entities
subsequent to the collection of the data when the responsible authority maintaining the data has
requested approval for a new or different use or dissemination of the data and that request has been
specifically approved by the commissioner as necessary to carry out a function assigned by law.
      (d) Private data may be used by and disseminated to any person or entity if the individual
subject or subjects of the data have given their informed consent. Whether a data subject has given
informed consent shall be determined by rules of the commissioner. T                                           ­h­­e­ ­

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Informed consent for insurance purposes. Informed consent for insurance purposes
must comply with this subdivision, unless otherwise prescribed by the HIPAA Standards for Privacy
of Individually Identifiable Health Information, Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, section 164.
Informed consent for insurance purposes is not considered to have been given by an individual
subject of data by the signing of a statement authorizing a government entity to disclose information
about the individual to an insurer or its authorized representative, unless the statement is:
   (1) in plain language;
   (2) dated;
    (3) specific in designating the government entity the data subject is authorizing to disclose
information about the data subject;
   (4) specific as to the nature of the information the subject is authorizing to be disclosed;
   (5) specific as to the persons to whom the subject is authorizing information to be disclosed;
   (6) specific as to the purpose or purposes for which the information may be used by any of the
persons named in clause (5), both at the time of the disclosure and at any time in the future; and
   (7) specific as to its expiration date, which must be within a reasonable period of time, not to
exceed one year.
    Notwithstanding clause (7), in the case of authorizations given in connection with applications
for life insurance or noncancelable or guaranteed renewable health insurance that is so identified,
the expiration date must not exceed two years after the date of the policy. An authorization in
connection with medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under chapter 256L or
for individual education plan health-related services provided by a school district under section
125A.21, subdivision 2, is valid during all terms of eligibility.
   Sec. 3. [13.394] INSURANCE CARRIERS.
    A government entity may provide data that are not public data to the insurance carrier
representing the government entity, its officers, employees, or agents in the investigation,
prosecution, or defense of any proceeding or matter in which the government entity, an officer,
employee, or agent is or has been given written notice that it is likely to become a party. For
purposes of this subdivision, "insurance carrier" includes a liability insurance carrier providing
coverage to the government entity, its officers, employees, or agents, or an insurance trust or risk
management pool of which the government entity is a member. Data that may be released under
this subdivision are limited to data that are necessary for the insurance carrier to assist in the
investigation, prosecution, or defense of the proceeding or matter. The government entity must
notify the subject of the data of any data that are released under this section. If data are provided to
an insurance carrier that is not a government entity, the person must maintain the data according to
the statutory classification applicable to the data.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13D.05, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. What meetings may be closed. (a) A public body may close a meeting to evaluate
the performance of an individual who is subject to its authority. The public body shall identify the
1304                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [28TH DAY

individual to be evaluated prior to closing a meeting. At its next open meeting, the public body shall
summarize its conclusions regarding the evaluation. A meeting must be open at the request of the
individual who is the subject of the meeting.
    (b) Meetings may be closed if the closure is expressly authorized by statute or permitted by the
attorney-client privilege.
   (c) A public body may close a meeting:
    (1) to determine the asking price for real or personal property to be sold by the government
entity;
    (2) to review confidential or protected nonpublic appraisal data under section 13.44, subdivision
3; and
   (3) to develop or consider offers or counteroffers for the purchase or sale of real or personal
property.
    Before holding a closed meeting under this paragraph, the public body must identify on
the record the particular real or personal property that is the subject of the closed meeting. The
proceedings of a meeting closed under this paragraph must be tape recorded at the expense of the
public body. The recording must be preserved for eight years after the date of the meeting and
made available to the public after all real or personal property discussed at the meeting has been
purchased or sold or the governing body has abandoned the purchase or sale. The real or personal
property that is the subject of the closed meeting must be specifically identified on the tape. A list of
members and all other persons present at the closed meeting must be made available to the public
after the closed meeting. If an action is brought claiming that public business other than discussions
allowed under this paragraph was transacted at a closed meeting held under this paragraph during
the time when the tape is not available to the public, section 13D.03, subdivision 3, applies.
An agreement reached that is based on an offer considered at a closed meeting is contingent on
approval of the public body at an open meeting. The actual purchase or sale must be approved at an
open meeting after the notice period required by statute or the governing body's internal procedures,
and the purchase price or sale price is public data.
    (d) Meetings may be closed to receive security briefings and reports, to discuss issues related
to security systems, to discuss emergency response procedures and to discuss security deficiencies
in or recommendations regarding public services, infrastructure and facilities, if disclosure of the
information discussed would pose a danger to public safety or compromise security procedures or
responses. Financial issues related to security matters must be discussed and all related financial
decisions must be made at an open meeting. Before closing a meeting under this paragraph,
the public body, in describing the subject to be discussed, must refer to the facilities, systems,
procedures, services, or infrastructures to be considered during the closed meeting. A closed
meeting must be tape recorded at the expense of the governing body, and the recording must be
preserved for at least four years.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.21, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

person's private health insurance premium may increase due to providing the covered service in the
school setting, (2) that the school district may pay certain enrollee health plan costs, including but not
limited to, co-payments, coinsurance, deductibles, premium increases or other enrollee cost-sharing
amounts for health and related services required by an individual service plan, or individual family
service plan, and (3) that the school's billing for each type of covered service may affect service
limits and prior authorization thresholds. The informed consent may be revoked in writing at any
time by the person authorizing the billing of the health plan.

                                  TEMPORARY CLASSIFICATIONS
    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.06, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Application to commissioner. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section
13.03, the responsible authority of a government entity may apply to the commissioner for
permission to classify data or types of data on individuals as private or confidential, or data
not on individuals as nonpublic or protected nonpublic, for its own use and for the use of other
similar government entities on a temporary basis until a proposed statute can be acted upon by the
legislature. The application for temporary classification is public.

                       ­g­ receipt by the commissioner of an application for temporary classification,
the data which is the subject of the application shall be deemed to be classified as set forth in the
application for a period of 45 days, or until the application is disapproved, rejected, or granted by
the commissioner, whichever is earlier.
    (c) If the commissioner determines that an application has been submitted for purposes not
consistent with this section, the commissioner may immediately reject the application, give notice
of that rejection to the applicant, and return the application. When the applicant receives the notice
of rejection from the commissioner, the data which was the subject of the application shall have the
classification it had before the application was submitted to the commissioner.

      Subd. 4. Procedure when classification affects others. If the commissioner determines that
an application for temporary classification involves data which would reasonably be classified in
the same manner by all government entities similar to the one which made the application, the
commissioner may approve or disapprove the classification for data of the kind which is the subject
of the application for the use of all government entities similar to the applicant. If requested in
the application, the commissioner may also determine that the data classification affects similar
government entities. On deeming this approach advisable, the commissioner shall provide notice
of the proposed action by publication in the State Register within ­e                                   t­­n 15 days of receiving the
application. Within 30 days after publication in the State Register an affected government entity

shall consider any comments received when granting or denying a classification for data of the kind
which is the subject of the application, for the use of all government entities similar to the applicant.
Within 45 days after the close of the period for submitting comment, the commissioner shall grant or
disapprove the application. Applications processed under this subdivision shall be either approved
or disapproved by the commissioner within 90 days of the receipt of the application. For purposes
of subdivision 1, the data which is the subject of the classification shall be deemed to be classified
as set forth in the application for a period of 90 days, or until the application is disapproved or
granted by the commissioner, whichever is earlier. ­                      I­f­r­

the commissioner's disapproval of an application, the data which is the subject of the application
shall become public data, unless the responsible authority submits an amended application for
temporary classification which requests the classification deemed appropriate by the commissioner

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Definition. As used in this section, "personnel data" means government data on
individuals ­c­
              o­l ­­
                l­ec­e
                    t­d­ maintained because the individual is or was an employee of or an applicant
for employment by, performs services on a voluntary basis for, or acts as an independent contractor
with a government entity. Personnel data includes data submitted by an employee to a government
entity as part of an organized self-evaluation effort by the government entity to request suggestions
from all employees on ways to cut costs, make government more efficient, or improve the operation
of government. An employee who is identified in a suggestion shall have access to all data in the
suggestion except the identity of the employee making the suggestion.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Public data. (a) Except for employees described in subdivision 5 and subject to
the limitations described in subdivision 5a, the following personnel data on current and former
employees, volunteers, and independent contractors of a government entity is public:
    (1) name; employee identification number, which must not be the employee's Social Security
number; actual gross salary; salary range; terms and conditions of employment relationship; contract
fees; actual gross pension; the value and nature of employer paid fringe benefits; and the basis for

and the amount of any employer-paid added remuneration, including expense reimbursement, in
addition to salary;
   (2) job title and bargaining unit; job description; education and training background; and
previous work experience;
   (3) date of first and last employment;
   (4) the existence and status of any complaints or charges against the employee, regardless of
whether the complaint or charge resulted in a disciplinary action;
   (5) the final disposition of any disciplinary action together with the specific reasons for the action
and data documenting the basis of the action, excluding data that would identify confidential sources
who are employees of the public body;
    (6) the terms of any agreement settling any dispute arising out of an employment relationship,
including a buyout agreement as defined in section 123B.143, subdivision 2, paragraph (a); except
that the agreement must include specific reasons for the agreement if it involves the payment of
more than $10,000 of public money;
   (7) work location; a work telephone number; employer-provided e-mail address; badge number;
work-related continuing education; and honors and awards received; and
   (8) payroll time sheets or other comparable data that are only used to account for employee's
work time for payroll purposes, except to the extent that release of time sheet data would reveal the
employee's reasons for the use of sick or other medical leave or other not public data.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a final disposition occurs when the government entity makes
its final decision about the disciplinary action, regardless of the possibility of any later proceedings
or court proceedings. In the case of arbitration proceedings arising under collective bargaining
agreements, a final disposition occurs at the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, or upon the
failure of the employee to elect arbitration within the time provided by the collective bargaining
agreement. Final disposition includes a resignation by an individual when the resignation occurs
after the final decision of the government entity, or arbitrator. A disciplinary action does not become
public data if an arbitrator sustains a grievance and reverses all aspects of any disciplinary action.
   (c) The government entity may display a photograph of a current or former employee to a
prospective witness as part of the government entity's investigation of any complaint or charge
against the employee.
    (d) A complainant has access to a statement provided by the complainant to a government entity
in connection with a complaint or charge against an employee.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), clause (5), upon completion of an investigation of a complaint
or charge against a public official, or if a public official resigns or is terminated from employment
while the complaint or charge is pending, all data relating to the complaint or charge are public,
unless access to the data would jeopardize an active investigation or reveal confidential sources.
For purposes of this paragraph, "public official" means:
   (1) the head of a state agency and deputy and assistant state agency heads;
   (2) members of boards or commissions required by law to be appointed by the governor or other

elective officers; and
    (3) executive or administrative heads of departments, bureaus, divisions, or institutions within
state government.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Continuity of operations. Personal home contact information may be used to ensure
that an employee can be reached in the event of an emergency or other disruption affecting continuity
of operation of a government entity. An employee's personal home contact information may be
shared with another government entity in the event of an emergency or other disruption to ensure
continuity of operation of either government entity.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 18. Private personnel data. Private personnel data of state employees must be disclosed
to the Department of Administration for the purpose of administration of the workers' compensation
program as provided in chapter 176.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.64, is amended to read:
   13.64 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION DATA.
    (a) Notes and preliminary drafts of reports created, collected, or maintained by the Management
Analysis Division, Department of Administration, and prepared during management studies, audits,
reviews, consultations, or investigations are classified as confidential or protected nonpublic data
until the final report has been published or preparation of the report is no longer being actively
pursued.
    (b) Data that support the conclusions of the report and that the commissioner of administration
reasonably believes will result in litigation are confidential or protected nonpublic until the litigation
has been completed or until the litigation is no longer being actively pursued.
   (c) Data on individuals that could reasonably be used to determine the identity of an individual
supplying data for a report are private if:
   (1) the data supplied by the individual were needed for a report; and
   (2) the data would not have been provided to the Management Analysis Division without an
assurance to the individual that the individual's identity would remain private, or the Management
Analysis Division reasonably believes that the individual would not have provided the data.
    (d) Security features of building plans, building specifications, and building drawings of
state-owned facilities and nonstate-owned facilities leased by the state are classified as nonpublic
data when maintained by the Department of Administration and may be shared with anyone as
needed to perform duties of the commissioner.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16B.97, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Data classification. Data maintained by the commissioner that identify a person
providing comments to the commissioner under subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clauses (6) and (7),
are private and nonpublic data but may be shared with the executive agency that is the subject of

the record, the screening service shall, without charge, investigate the disputed record. In conducting
an investigation, the business screening service shall review and consider all relevant information
submitted by the subject of the record with respect to the disputed record.
   (b) If the disputed record is found to be inaccurate or incomplete, the business screening service
shall promptly correct the record. If the disputed record is found to be sealed, expunged, or the
subject of a pardon, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record.
     (c) A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the
business screening agency reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, which may be based
on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed
record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous, the business screening service
shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons why it has determined that the dispute
is frivolous and provide a description of any information required to investigate the disputed record.
    (d) The business screening service shall notify the subject of the disputed record of the correction
or deletion of the record or of the termination or completion of the investigation related to the record

record.

record must include the date when the record was collected and a notice that the information may
include records that have been expunged, sealed, or otherwise have become inaccessible to the
public since that date.
    Subd. 5. Remedies; relationship to FCRA. (a) A business screening service that violates this
section is liable to the individual who is the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual
damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable
attorney fees.
    (b) A business screening service in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, United States Code, title 15, section 1681, et seq., is considered to be in compliance
with this section. Those entities are subject to the state remedies under this subdivision when their
actions would violate this section and federal law.

criminal record information in this state or that obtains a criminal record from a government entity,
as defined in section 13.02, or a court in this state is deemed to have consented to service of

   17.4981 GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR REGULATION OF AQUATIC FARMS.
    (a) Aquatic farms are licensed to culture private aquatic life. Cultured aquatic life is not wildlife.
Aquatic farms must be licensed and given classifications to prevent or minimize impacts on natural
resources. The purpose of sections 17.4981 to 17.4997 is to:
   (1) prevent public aquatic life from entering an aquatic farm;
    (2) prevent release of nonindigenous or exotic species into public waters without approval of
the commissioner;
   (3) protect against release of disease pathogens to public waters;
   (4) protect existing natural aquatic habitats and the wildlife dependent on them; and
   (5) protect private aquatic life from unauthorized taking or harvest.
   (b) Private aquatic life that is legally acquired and possessed is an article of interstate commerce
and may be restricted only as necessary to protect state fish and water resources.
    (c) The commissioner of natural resources shall establish license and other fees as provided
in section 16A.1285, subdivision 2, that would make aquaculture licensing and enforcement
self-sustaining. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner may, by written order
published in the State Register, establish the fees required by this section. The fees are not subject
to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The commissioner

shall develop best management practices for aquaculture to ensure the long-term sustainability
of aquaculture and wetlands used for aquaculture, including, but not limited to, fish farming in
man-made ponds.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 17.4988, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Inspection and additional fees. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner
may, by written order published in the State Register, establish fees for the services listed in clauses
(1) to (3) and the additional fee required under subdivision 2, paragraph (a). The fees must be set in
an amount that does not recover significantly more or less than the cost of providing the service. The
fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
The services covered under this provision include:
   (1) initial inspection of each water to be licensed;
   (2) fish health inspection and certification, including initial tissue sample collection, basic fish
health assessment, viral pathogen testing, and bacteriological testing; and
   (3) initial inspection for containment and quarantine facility inspections."

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7a. Alternate overnight supervision technology; adult foster care license. (a) The
commissioner may grant an applicant or license holder an adult foster care license for a residence that
does not have a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours as required under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 37, item B, but uses monitoring technology to alert the license holder
when an incident occurs that may jeopardize the health, safety, or rights of a foster care recipient.
The applicant or license holder must comply with all other requirements under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, and the requirements under this subdivision. The license printed by
the commissioner must state in bold and large font:
   (1) that staff are not present on-site overnight; and
   (2) the telephone number of the county's common entry point for making reports of suspected
maltreatment of vulnerable adults under section 626.557, subdivision 9.
    (b) Applications for a license under this section must be submitted directly to the Department of
Human Services licensing division. The licensing division must immediately notify the host county
and lead county contract agency and the host county licensing agency. The licensing division must
collaborate with the county licensing agency in the review of the application and the licensing of
the program.
    (c) Before a license is issued by the commissioner, and for the duration of the license, the
applicant or license holder must establish, maintain, and document the implementation of written
policies and procedures addressing the requirements in paragraphs (c) through (f).
   (d) The applicant or license holder must have policies and procedures that:
   (1) establish characteristics of target populations that will be admitted into the home, and
characteristics of populations that will not be accepted into the home;
   (2) explain the discharge process when a foster care recipient requires overnight supervision or
other services that cannot be provided by the license holder due to the limited hours that the license
holder is on-site;
   (3) describe the types of events to which the program will respond with a physical presence
when those events occur in the home during time when staff are not on-site, and how the license
holder's response plan meets the requirements in paragraph (d), clause (1) or (2);
    (4) establish a process for documenting a review of the implementation and effectiveness
of the response protocol for the response required under paragraph (d), clause (1) or (2). The
documentation must include:
   (i) a description of the triggering incident;
   (ii) the date and time of the triggering incident;
   (iii) the time of the response or responses under paragraph (d), clause (1) or (2);
1324                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [28TH DAY

   (iv) whether the response met the resident's needs;
   (v) whether the existing policies and response protocols were followed; and
   (vi) whether the existing policies and protocols are adequate or need modification.
    When no physical presence response is completed for a three-month period, the license holder's
written policies and procedures must require a physical presence response drill be to conducted
for which the effectiveness of the response protocol under paragraph (d), clause (1) or (2), will be
reviewed and documented as required under this clause; and
    (5) establish that emergency and nonemergency phone numbers are posted in a prominent
location in a common area of the home where they can be easily observed by a person responding
to an incident who is not otherwise affiliated with the home.
    (e) The license holder must document and include in the license application which response
alternative under clause (1) or (2) is in place for responding to situations that present a serious risk
to the health, safety, or rights of people receiving foster care services in the home:
    (1) response alternative (1) requires only the technology to provide an electronic notification or
alert to the license holder that an event is underway that requires a response. Under this alternative,
no more than ten minutes will pass before the license holder will be physically present on-site to
respond to the situation; or
    (2) response alternative (2) requires the electronic notification and alert system under alternative
(1), but more than ten minutes may pass before the license holder is present on-site to respond to
the situation. Under alternative (2), all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) the license holder has a written description of the interactive technological applications that
will assist the licenser holder in communicating with and assessing the needs related to care, health,
and safety of the foster care recipients. This interactive technology must permit the license holder
to remotely assess the well being of the foster care recipient without requiring the initiation or
participation by the foster care recipient. Requiring the foster care recipient to initiate a telephone
call or answer a telephone call does not meet this requirement;
    (ii) the license holder documents how the remote license holder is qualified and capable of
meeting the needs of the foster care recipients and assessing foster care recipients' needs under
item (ii) during the absence of the license holder on-site;
    (iii) the license holder maintains written procedures to dispatch emergency response personnel
to the site in the event of an identified emergency; and
    (iv) each foster care recipient's individualized plan of care, individual service plan under section
256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required, or individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota
Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required, identifies the maximum response time, which may
be greater than ten minutes, for the license holder to be on-site for that foster care recipient.
    (f) All placement agreements, individual service agreements, and plans applicable to the foster
care recipient must clearly state that the adult foster care license category is a program without the
presence of a caregiver in the residence during normal sleeping hours; the protocols in place for
responding to situations that present a serious risk to health, safety, or rights of foster care recipients

under paragraph (d), clause (1) or (2); and a signed informed consent from each foster care recipient
or the person's legal representative documenting the person's or legal representative's agreement with
placement in the program. If electronic monitoring technology is used in the home, the informed
consent form must also explain the following:
   (1) how any electronic monitoring is incorporated into the alternative supervision system;
   (2) the backup system for any electronic monitoring in times of electrical outages or other
equipment malfunctions;
   (3) how the license holder is trained on the use of the technology;
   (4) the event types and license holder response times established under paragraph (d);
    (5) how the license holder protects the foster care recipient's privacy related to electronic
monitoring and related to any electronically recorded data generated by the monitoring system. The
consent form must explain where and how the electronically recorded data is stored, with whom it
will be shared, and how long it is retained; and
   (6) the risks and benefits of the alternative overnight supervision system.
    The written explanations under clauses (1) to (6) may be accomplished through cross-references
to other policies and procedures as long as they are explained to the person giving consent, and the
person giving consent is offered a copy.
    (g) Nothing in this section requires the applicant or license holder to develop or maintain separate
or duplicative polices, procedures, documentation, consent forms, or individual plans that may be
required for other licensing standards, if the requirements of this section are incorporated into those
documents.
    (h) The commissioner may grant variances to the requirements of this section according to
section 245A.04, subdivision 9.

   (h) A license holder must provide the commissioner notice through the commissioner's online
background study system or through a letter mailed to the commissioner when:
   (1) an individual returns to a position requiring a background study following an absence of 45
or more consecutive days; or
   (2) a program that discontinued providing licensed direct contact services for 45 or more
consecutive days begins to provide direct contact licensed services again.
    The license holder shall maintain a copy of the notification provided to the commissioner under
this paragraph in the program's files.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245C.07, is amended to read:
   245C.07 STUDY SUBJECT AFFILIATED WITH MULTIPLE FACILITIES.
    (a) When a license holder, applicant, or other entity owns multiple programs or services that
are licensed by the Department of Human Services, Department of Health, or Department of
Corrections, only one background study is required for an individual who provides direct contact
services in one or more of the licensed programs or services if:
    (1) the license holder designates one individual with one address and telephone number as the
person to receive sensitive background study information for the multiple licensed programs or
services that depend on the same background study; and
    (2) the individual designated to receive the sensitive background study information is capable
of determining, upon request of the department, whether a background study subject is providing
direct contact services in one or more of the license holder's programs or services and, if so, at which
location or locations.
    (b) When a license holder maintains background study compliance for multiple licensed
programs according to paragraph (a), and one or more of the licensed programs closes, the license
holder shall immediately notify the commissioner which staff will be transferred to an active
license so that the background studies can be electronically paired with the license holder's active
program.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (c) When a background study is being initiated by a licensed program or service or a foster
care provider that is also registered under chapter 144D, a study subject affiliated with multiple
licensed programs or services may attach to the background study form a cover letter indicating
the additional names of the programs or services, addresses, and background study identification
numbers.
   When the commissioner receives a notice, the commissioner shall notify each program or service
identified by the background study subject of the study results.
   The background study notice the commissioner sends to the subsequent agencies shall satisfy
those programs' or services' responsibilities for initiating a background study on that individual.

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), family child care license holders are not required to disclose
that the program has an individual living in the home who is the subject of a set-aside or variance if:
    (1) the household member resides in the residence where the family child care is provided;
    (2) the subject of the set-aside or variance is under the age of 18 years; and
    (3) the set-aside or variance relates to a disqualification under section 245C.15, subdivision 4,
for a misdemeanor-level theft crime as defined in section 609.52.
    (c) The notice specified in paragraph (a) is not required when the period of disqualification in
section 245C.15, subdivisions 2 to 4, has been exceeded.
    (d) Upon receipt of a notice from the commissioner that a disqualification has been set aside
or a variance has been granted related to a current employee, child care centers must provide a
written notification to parents of children attending the child care center with whom that employee
may have contact. An investigation memorandum posted under section 245A.06, subdivision 8, or
section 245A.07, subdivision 5, that reports the disqualification of the individual who is the subject
of the notice under this paragraph is no longer required to be posted after the license holder provides
the notice required under this paragraph."

28TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 2009                                        1339

The team may review cases in which prosecution has been completed or the prosecutorial authority
has decided not to pursue the case. The purpose of the review team is to assess domestic violence
deaths in order to develop recommendations for policies and protocols for community prevention
and intervention initiatives to reduce and eliminate the incidence of domestic violence and resulting
fatalities.
    Subd. 2. Definition of domestic violence death. "Domestic violence death" means a homicide
or suicide under any of the following circumstances:
   (1) the alleged perpetrator and victim resided together at any time;
   (2) the alleged perpetrator and victim have a child in common, regardless of whether they were
married or lived together at any time;
   (3) the alleged perpetrator and victim were married, separated, or divorced;
    (4) the alleged perpetrator and victim had a sexual relationship or a significant romantic
relationship;
   (5) the alleged perpetrator had been stalking the victim;
   (6) the homicide victim lived in the same household, was present in the workplace of, was in
proximity of, or was related by blood or affinity to a victim who experienced or was threatened with
domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator;
    (7) the victim or the perpetrator was a child of a person in a relationship that is described within
this definition; or
   (8) any other circumstances that the domestic fatality review team decides falls within the
parameters of its mission.
    "Domestic violence death" must be interpreted broadly to give the domestic fatality review

Information, documents, and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from
discovery or use in a civil or criminal action solely because they were presented during proceedings
of the review team. This section does not limit a person who presented information before the review
team or who is a member of the panel from testifying about matters within the person's knowledge.
However, in a civil or criminal proceeding, a person may not be questioned about the person's good
faith presentation of information to the review team or opinions formed by the person as a result of
the review team meetings.
    Subd. 6. Immunity. Members of the domestic fatality advisory board, members of the domestic
fatality review team, and members of each review panel, as well as their agents or employees, are
immune from claims and are not subject to any suits, liability, damages, or any other recourse, civil
or criminal, arising from any act, proceeding, decision, or determination undertaken or performed or
recommendation made by the domestic fatality review team, provided they acted in good faith and
without malice in carrying out their responsibilities. Good faith is presumed until proven otherwise
and the complainant has the burden of proving malice or a lack of good faith. No organization,
institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports, or records to the domestic
fatality review team as part of an investigation is civilly or criminally liable or subject to any other
recourse for providing the information.

members of the senate and house committees with jurisdiction over public safety issues. The report
