on any county state-aid highway and shall be reimbursed for such construction, reconstruction,
or improvements from the amount set aside by this subdivision. Before requesting a county to do
work on a county state-aid highway as provided in this subdivision, the commissioner of natural
resources must obtain approval for the project from the County State-Aid Screening Board. The
screening board, before giving its approval, must obtain a written comment on the project from the
county engineer of the county requested to undertake the project. Before requesting a county to do
work on a county road, city street, roadway in the outdoor recreation system, or a town road that

all other aspects but comes in above the maximum price. If the commissioner does not award a
contract, all short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the commissioner cancels the
contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the commissioner shall award each design-builder
on the short list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the commissioner's
estimated cost of design and construction. The commissioner shall pay the stipulated fee to each
proposer within 90 days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract.
In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the commissioner may use any ideas or information
contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project or in connection
with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the
unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, an unsuccessful
short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short-list proposer elects
to waive the stipulated fee, the commissioner may not use ideas and information contained in that
proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the commissioner, a proposer who waived a stipulated
fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the commissioner shall pay the stipulated fee to the
proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the proposer's proposal.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 161.3426, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Reissue of request for proposals. If the commissioner rejects all bids or does not
execute the contract, the commissioner may reissue the request for proposals and allow only
short-listed teams to resubmit proposals. The commissioner shall then pay a reasonable stipulated
fee to each short-listed, responsible proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal
in response to the reissued request for proposals. When the reissued request for proposals specifies
a maximum price, the stipend shall be awarded if the proposal is responsive in all other aspects
but comes in above the maximum price."

    Subdivision 1. Definition. "Complete streets" is the planning, scoping, design, implementation,
operation, and maintenance of roads in order to reasonably address the safety and accessibility needs
of users of all ages and abilities. Complete streets considers the needs of motorists, pedestrians,
transit users and vehicles, bicyclists, and commercial and emergency vehicles moving along and
across roads, intersections, and crossings in a manner that is sensitive to the local context and
recognizes that the needs vary in urban, suburban, and rural settings.
   Subd. 2. Implementation. The commissioner shall implement a complete streets policy after
consultation with stakeholders, state and regional agencies, local governments, and road authorities.

requirements, and training, and shall integrate related principles of context-sensitive solutions.

the complete streets policy in the agency's biennial budget submission under section 174.02.
    Subd. 4. Local road authorities. Local road authorities are encouraged, but not required, to
create and adopt complete streets policies for their roads that reflect local context and goals. Nothing
in this section may be construed to prohibit a local road authority from adopting a complete streets
policy that incorporates or exceeds statutory complete streets principles.
    Subd. 5. Variances from engineering standards. (a) When evaluating a request for a variance
from the engineering standards for state-aid projects under chapter 162 in which the variance request
is related to complete streets, the commissioner shall consider the latest edition of:
    (1) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, from the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials; and
   (2) for projects in urban areas, the Context Sensitive Solutions in Designing Major Urban
Thoroughfares for Walkable Communities, from the Institute of Transportation Engineers.

shall provide written reasons for the denial to the political subdivision that submitted the request."
