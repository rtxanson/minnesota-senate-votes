commissioner of finance, upon request of
the commissioner of transportation, shall
notify the chair of the Transportation Finance
Division of the house of representatives
and the chair of the Transportation Budget
Division of the senate of the amount of the
remainder and shall then add that amount
to the appropriation. The amount added is
2430                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE       [37TH DAY

sole purpose of obtaining emergency assistance to prevent a crime about to be committed, or in the
reasonable belief that a person's life or safety was in danger. Violation of this paragraph is a petty
misdemeanor subject to section 169.89, subdivision 2.
