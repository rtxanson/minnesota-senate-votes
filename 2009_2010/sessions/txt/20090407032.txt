government agencies and nonprofit organizations seeking to establish qualified alternative dispute
resolution programs. The applications shall be reviewed by the advisory committee, and the

programs submitting applications. The funds shall be distributed in accordance with the following
formula:
   (a) Eighty-five percent of the funds distributed shall be distributed to qualified legal services

programs that have demonstrated an ability as of July 1, 1982, to provide legal services to persons
unable to afford private counsel with funds provided by the federal Legal Services Corporation.
The allocation of funds among the programs selected shall be based upon the number of persons
with incomes below the poverty level established by the United States Census Bureau who reside
in the geographical area served by each program, as determined by the Supreme Court on the basis
of the most recent national census. All funds distributed pursuant to this clause shall be used for
the provision of legal services in civil and farm legal assistance matters as prioritized by program
boards of directors to eligible clients.
     (b) Fifteen percent of the funds distributed may be distributed (1) to other qualified legal
services programs for the provision of legal services in civil matters to eligible clients, including
programs which organize members of the private bar to perform services and programs for
qualified alternative dispute resolution, (2) to programs for training mediators operated by
nonprofit alternative dispute resolution corporations, or (3) to qualified legal services programs to
provide family farm legal assistance for financially distressed state farmers. The family farm legal
assistance must be directed at farm financial problems including, but not limited to, liquidation of
farm property including bankruptcy, farm foreclosure, repossession of farm assets, restructuring or
discharge of farm debt, farm credit and general debtor-creditor relations, and tax considerations. If
all the funds to be distributed pursuant to this clause cannot be distributed because of insufficient
acceptable applications, the remaining funds shall be distributed pursuant to clause (a).
    A person is eligible for legal assistance under this section if the person is an eligible client as
defined in section 480.24, subdivision 2, or:
   (1) is a state resident;
   (2) is or has been a farmer or a family shareholder of a family farm corporation within the
preceding 24 months;

   Page 154, after line 26, insert:
   "Sec. 7. SALARY FREEZE.
    Subdivision 1. Salary increases prohibited. (a) From the effective date of this section through
June 30, 2011, a school district or charter school must not increase the rate of salary or wages for
any employee. This section prohibits any increase including, but not limited to, across-the-board
increases; cost-of-living adjustments; increases based on longevity; increases as a result of step and
lane changes; increases in the form of lump-sum payments; increases in employer contributions
to deferred compensation plans; or any other pay grade adjustments of any kind. For purposes of
this section, salary or wages does not include employer contributions toward the cost of medical or
dental insurance premiums, provided that employee contributions to the costs of medical or dental
insurance premiums are not decreased.
    (b) This section does not prohibit an increase in the rate of salary and wages for an employee
who is promoted or transferred to a position with greater job responsibilities. Additional
educational credits or degrees or a lane change is not a promotion or a transfer to a position with
greater job responsibilities. This section also does not prohibit a school district or charter school
from implementing an alternative compensation program approved by the commissioner of the
Department of Education. The commissioner may approve an alternative compensation program at
the commissioner's sole discretion.
    Subd. 2. Contracts in effect. (a) This section does not prohibit a government employer from
effectuating an increase in the rate of salary or wages for employees if required by a contract or
collective bargaining agreement that is in effect before the effective date of this section. However,
from the effective date of this section until June 30, 2011, a school district or charter school may
not:
    (1) enter into a new contract or collective bargaining agreement that increases salary or wages
in a manner prohibited by this section; or
    (2) increase the rate of salary or wages for employees through extension of an expired contract
or collective bargaining agreement or any other arrangement or agreement.
    (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if, as of the effective date of this section, a school
district or charter school has agreed to or entered into a contract or collective bargaining agreement
that is not scheduled to become effective until after the effective date of this section, any provision of
the contract or collective bargaining agreement that violates subdivision 1, paragraph (a), is void. If
this occurs, the exclusive representative may rescind the entire contract or collective bargaining
agreement. To be effective, a request to rescind the contract must be made within 30 calendar
days following the effective date of this section. Any subsequent contract or collective bargaining
agreement must comply with the terms of this section.
    (c) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, upon expiration of a contract or collective
bargaining agreement, each employee must remain at the rate of salary and wage in effect at the
time the contract expired, except as authorized in subdivision 1, paragraph (b). Any language in
a contract or collective bargaining agreement that attempts to extend the terms of the contract or
collective bargaining agreement is invalid if it seeks to extend the application of the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement past the durational limits set forth in Minnesota Statutes, section
179A.20, subdivision 3.

    Subd. 3. Future contracts. A contract or collective bargaining agreement or compensation plan
entered into after June 30, 2011, must not provide a retroactive salary or wage increase that applies
to a period before June 30, 2011, if that increase would be prohibited by this section if granted before
June 30, 2011.
    Subd. 4. Arbitration and strikes. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary:
    (1) employees of a school district or charter school may not legally strike due to a government
employer's refusal to grant a salary or wage increase if the refusal is required to comply with this
section; and
    (2) neither a school district or charter school nor an exclusive representative may request interest
arbitration in relation to an increase in the rate of salary or wages that is prohibited by this section
and an arbitrator may not issue an award that would increase salary or wages in a manner prohibited
by this section.
   Subd. 5. Relation to other law. This section supersedes Minnesota Statutes, chapter 179A, and
any other law to the contrary. It is not an unfair labor practice under Minnesota Statutes, chapter
179A, for a public employer to take any action required to comply with this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE; EXPIRATION. This section is effective the day following final
enactment. Subdivisions 1, 2, 4, and 5, expire on June 30, 2011."

   "Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123A.73, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Consolidation; maximum authorized referendum revenues. (a) As of the effective
date of a consolidation pursuant to section 123A.48, if the plan for consolidation so provides, or if the
plan for consolidation makes no provision concerning referendum revenues, the authorization for
all referendum revenues previously approved by the voters of all affected districts for those districts
pursuant to section 126C.17, subdivision 9, or its predecessor provision shall be recalculated as
provided in this subdivision. The referendum revenue authorization for the newly created district
shall be the revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that would raise an amount equal to the
combined dollar amount of the referendum revenues authorized by each of the component districts
for the year preceding the consolidation, unless the referendum revenue authorization of the newly
created district is subsequently modified pursuant to section 126C.17, subdivision 9.
    (b) The referendum allowance for a consolidated district in the years following consolidation
equals the average of the consolidating districts' existing authorities for those years, weighted by the
districts' resident marginal cost pupil units in the year preceding consolidation. For purposes of this
calculation, the referendum authorities used for individual districts shall not decrease from year to
year until such time as all existing authorities for all the consolidating districts have fully expired,
but shall increase if they were originally approved with consumer price index-based or other annual
increases.
    (c) The referendum revenue authorization for the newly created district shall continue for a
period of time equal to the longest period authorized for any component district.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal years 2010 and later.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123A.73, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

section 123A.48, if the plan for consolidation so provides, the authorization for all referendum
revenues previously approved by the voters of all affected districts for those districts pursuant
to section 126C.17, subdivision 9, or its predecessor provision shall be combined as provided in

allowance per resident marginal cost pupil unit provided in the plan for consolidation, but may not
exceed the allowance per resident marginal cost pupil unit that would raise an amount equal to the
