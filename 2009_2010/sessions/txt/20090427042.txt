    Subd. 21. Payment of post-PERA pension benefit costs. Nursing facilities that convert or
converted after September 30, 2006, from public to private ownership shall have a portion of their
post-PERA pension costs treated as a component of the historic operating rate. Effective for the
rate years beginning on or after October 1, 2009, and prior to October 1, 2016, the commissioner
shall determine the pension costs to be included in the facility's base for determining rates under this
section by using the following formula: post-privatization pension benefit costs as a percent of salary
shall be determined from either the cost report for the first full reporting year after privatization or the
most recent report year available, whichever is later. This percentage shall be applied to the salary
costs of the alternative payment system base rate year to determine the allowable amount of pension
costs. The adjustments provided for in sections 256B.431, 256B.434, 256B.441, and any other law
enacted after the base rate year and prior to the year for which rates are being determined shall be
applied to the allowable amount. The adjusted allowable amount shall be added to the operating rate
effective the first rate year PERA ceases to remain as a pass-through component of the rate."

clause (4) or (9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for a disqualification
is serious or recurring maltreatment, which has not been set aside under sections 245C.22 and
245C.23, shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of review by the
human services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be a bar to a hearing
under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to dispute a finding
of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest the specified
action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written request for a
hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action, decision,
or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or
relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time limit.     ­; or
    (11) any person with an outstanding debt resulting from receipt of public assistance, medical
care, or the federal Food Stamp Act who is contesting a setoff claim by the Department of Human
Services or a county agency. The scope of the appeal is the validity of the claimant agency's intention
to request setoff of a refund under chapter 270A against the debt.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.
   (c) For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
    (d) The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under paragraph (a), clause
(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement
under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care
payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.
   (e) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.

than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),
a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the

detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
     (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
    (q) An individual convicted of a crime of violence, as defined in section 624.712, subdivision
5, or as defined under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed, is not eligible
for general assistance medical care.

of these resolutions and agreements.
    Subd. 4. Single county human service authority. For counties with populations over 250,000,
the board of county commissioners may be the human service authority and retain existing

service authority shall enter into shared services arrangements with other human service authorities
or smaller counties. These shared services arrangements may include, but are not limited to:

1, 2012; and
   (4) by June 1, 2012, and each June 1 thereafter, meet performance standards as defined by the
commissioner of human services.

may join an established human service authority at a later time by submitting to the commissioner:
      (1) a county board resolution indicating the county's intent to join a human service authority;
and
      (2) an amended joint powers agreement of the accepting human service authority.
    Subd. 6. Agreement. Any agreement under subdivision 3 or 4 must be governed by this chapter
and section 471.59. The county boards of commissioners must be party to the agreement and shall
determine the proportional financial responsibility of each county to support the programs and
services of the human service authority. This subdivision does not limit the authority of a county

    (b) If any county with a population of less than 250,000 timely submits a resolution of intent
to join a human service authority, but is unable to secure a joint powers agreement described
in subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (2), then the commissioner of human services may, in
consultation with the affected counties, assign the county to a human service authority.
    (c) If a county has not created or joined a human service authority and that county fails to
meet the performance standards established under subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (4), then
the commissioner of human services may assign the county to a human service authority.
    (d) The commissioner of human services retains the authority to make the assignments described
in this subdivision beyond the year in which initial human service authorities are created.

to the commissioner of health case mix assessments that conform with the assessment schedule

Long Term Care Assessment Instrument User's Manual, version 2.0, October 1995, and subsequent

    Subd. 8. Request for reconsideration of resident classifications. (a) The resident, or resident's
representative, or the nursing facility or boarding care home may request that the commissioner of
health reconsider the assigned reimbursement classification. The request for reconsideration must
be submitted in writing to the commissioner within 30 days of the day the resident or the resident's
representative receives the resident classification notice. The request for reconsideration must
include the name of the resident, the name and address of the facility in which the resident resides,
the reasons for the reconsideration, the requested classification changes, and documentation
supporting the requested classification. The documentation accompanying the reconsideration
request is limited to documentation which establishes that the needs of the resident at the time of
the assessment justify a classification which is different than the classification established by the
commissioner of health.
   (b) Upon request, the nursing facility must give the resident or the resident's representative a
copy of the assessment form and the other documentation that was given to the commissioner of

health to support the assessment findings. The nursing facility shall also provide access to and a copy
of other information from the resident's record that has been requested by or on behalf of the resident
to support a resident's reconsideration request. A copy of any requested material must be provided
within three working days of receipt of a written request for the information. If a facility fails to
provide the material within this time, it is subject to the issuance of a correction order and penalty
assessment under sections 144.653 and 144A.10. Notwithstanding those sections, any correction
order issued under this subdivision must require that the nursing facility immediately comply with
the request for information and that as of the date of the issuance of the correction order, the facility
shall forfeit to the state a $100 fine for the first day of noncompliance, and an increase in the $100
fine by $50 increments for each day the noncompliance continues.
    (c) In addition to the information required under paragraphs (a) and (b), a reconsideration request
from a nursing facility must contain the following information: (i) the date the reimbursement
classification notices were received by the facility; (ii) the date the classification notices were
distributed to the resident or the resident's representative; and (iii) a copy of a notice sent to the
resident or to the resident's representative. This notice must inform the resident or the resident's
representative that a reconsideration of the resident's classification is being requested, the reason
for the request, that the resident's rate will change if the request is approved by the commissioner,
the extent of the change, that copies of the facility's request and supporting documentation are
available for review, and that the resident also has the right to request a reconsideration. If the
facility fails to provide the required information with the reconsideration request, the request
must be denied, and the facility may not make further reconsideration requests on that specific
reimbursement classification.
    (d) Reconsideration by the commissioner must be made by individuals not involved in
reviewing the assessment, audit, or reconsideration that established the disputed classification. The
reconsideration must be based upon the initial assessment and upon the information provided to the
commissioner under paragraphs (a) and (b). If necessary for evaluating the reconsideration request,
the commissioner may conduct on-site reviews. Within 15 working days of receiving the request
for reconsideration, the commissioner shall affirm or modify the original resident classification.
The original classification must be modified if the commissioner determines that the assessment
resulting in the classification did not accurately reflect the needs or assessment characteristics of
the resident at the time of the assessment. The resident and the nursing facility or boarding care
home shall be notified within five working days after the decision is made. A decision by the
commissioner under this subdivision is the final administrative decision of the agency for the party
requesting reconsideration.
    (e) The resident classification established by the commissioner shall be the classification
that applies to the resident while the request for reconsideration is pending. If a request for
reconsideration applies to an assessment used to determine nursing facility level of care under
subdivision 4, paragraph (c), the resident shall continue to be eligible for nursing facility level of
care while the request for reconsideration is pending.
   (f) The commissioner may request additional documentation regarding a reconsideration
necessary to make an accurate reconsideration determination.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.0724, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

   (1) the person needs the assistance of another person or constant supervision to begin and
complete at least four activities of daily living;
   (2) the person needs the assistance of another person or constant supervision to begin and

    (3) the person has significant difficulty with memory, using information, daily decision making,

face-to-face long-term care consultation assessment as specified in section 256B.0911, subdivision
3a, 3b, or 4d, by a county, tribe, or managed care organization under contract with the Department
of Human Services. The person is considered at risk under this clause if the person currently lives

recipient enrolled in managed care experiences a temporary disenrollment from a health plan, the
commissioner shall accept the current health plan authorization for personal care assistance services
for up to 60 days. The request must be received within the first 30 days of the disenrollment. If the
recipient's reenrollment in managed care is after the 60 days and before 90 days, the provider shall
request an additional 30-day extension of the current health plan authorization, for a total limit of
90 days from the time of disenrollment.

for private duty nursing services shall be based on medical necessity and cost-effectiveness when
compared with alternative care options. The commissioner may authorize medically necessary
private duty nursing services in quarter-hour units when:
    (1) the recipient requires more individual and continuous care than can be provided during a
skilled nurse visit; or
   (2) the cares are outside of the scope of services that can be provided by a home health aide or
personal care assistant.
   (b) The commissioner may authorize:
    (1) up to two times the average amount of direct care hours provided in nursing facilities
statewide for case mix classification "K" as established by the annual cost report submitted to the
department by nursing facilities in May 1992;
   (2) private duty nursing in combination with other home care services up to the total cost allowed
under section 256B.0655, subdivision 4;
    (3) up to 16 hours per day if the recipient requires more nursing than the maximum number of
direct care hours as established in clause (1) and the recipient meets the hospital admission criteria
established under Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0501 to 9505.0540.
    (c) The commissioner may authorize up to 16 hours per day of medically necessary private duty
nursing services or up to 24 hours per day of medically necessary private duty nursing services
until such time as the commissioner is able to make a determination of eligibility for recipients who
are cooperatively applying for home care services under the community alternative care program
developed under section 256B.49, or until it is determined by the appropriate regulatory agency
that a health benefit plan is or is not required to pay for appropriate medically necessary health care
services. Recipients or their representatives must cooperatively assist the commissioner in obtaining
this determination. Recipients who are eligible for the community alternative care program may not
receive more hours of nursing under this section and sections 256B.0651, 256B.0653, ­      25

    (i) The commissioner shall provide a rate methodology for shared private duty nursing. For two
persons sharing nursing care, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed 1.5 times the regular private
duty nursing rates paid for serving a single individual by a registered nurse or licensed practical
nurse. These rates apply only to situations in which both recipients are present and receive shared
private duty nursing care on the date for which the service is billed.
    Subd. 4. Hardship criteria; private duty nursing. (a) Payment is allowed for extraordinary
services that require specialized nursing skills and are provided by parents of minor children,
spouses, and legal guardians who are providing private duty nursing care under the following
conditions:
   (1) the provision of these services is not legally required of the parents, spouses, or legal
guardians;
     (2) the services are necessary to prevent hospitalization of the recipient; and
   (3) the recipient is eligible for state plan home care or a home and community-based waiver and
one of the following hardship criteria are met:
     (i) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian resigns from a part-time or full-time job to provide

   (ii) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian goes from a full-time to a part-time job with less
compensation to provide nursing care for the recipient; ­

    (iii) the parent, spouse, or legal guardian takes a leave of absence without pay to provide nursing
care for the recipient; or
    (iv) because of labor conditions, special language needs, or intermittent hours of care needed,
the parent, spouse, or legal guardian is needed in order to provide adequate private duty nursing
services to meet the medical needs of the recipient.
    (b) Private duty nursing may be provided by a parent, spouse, or legal guardian who is a nurse
licensed in Minnesota. Private duty nursing services provided by a parent, spouse, or legal guardian
cannot be used in lieu of nursing services covered and available under liable third-party payors,
including Medicare. The private duty nursing provided by a parent, spouse, or legal guardian must
be included in the service plan. Authorized ­

with the same residence and provided by the parent, spouse, or legal guardian may not exceed
50 percent of the total approved nursing hours, or eight hours per day, whichever is less, up to
a maximum of 40 hours per week. A parent or parents, spouse, or legal guardian shall not provide
more than 40 hours of services in a seven-day period. For parents and legal guardians, 40 hours is the
total amount allowed regardless of the number of children or adults who receive services. Nothing
in this subdivision precludes the parent's, spouse's, or legal guardian's obligation of assuming the
nonreimbursed family responsibilities of emergency backup caregiver and primary caregiver.
      (c) A parent or a spouse may not be paid to provide private duty nursing care if:
     (1) the parent or spouse fails to pass a criminal background check according to chapter 245C,
                                                                                                 ­

   (d) For purposes of this section, "assessment" means a review and evaluation of a recipient's
need for home care services conducted in person. Assessments for private duty nursing must be
conducted by a registered nurse.

42ND DAY]                                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                                                    3131

256B.0651, subdivision 11, and 256B.0911. The authorization for personal care assistance and
qualified professional services under section 256B.0659 must be completed within 30 days after
receiving a complete request.
    (b) The amount of personal care assistant services authorized must be based on the recipient's
home care rating. The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or the
commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner identifying the
following:
     (1) total number of dependencies of activities of daily living as defined in section 256B.0659;
     (2) number of complex health-related functions as defined in section 256B.0659; and
     (3) number of behavior descriptions as defined in section 256B.0659.
    (c) The methodology to determine total time for personal care assistance services for each home
care rating is based on fiscal year 2007 data from the personal care assistance program. Each home
care rating has a base level of hours assigned. Additional time is added through the assessment and
identification of the following:
    (1) 30 additional minutes for a dependency in each critical activity of daily living as defined in
section 256B.0659;
   (2) 30 additional minutes for each complex health-related function as defined in section
256B.0659; and
     (3) 30 additional minutes for each behavior issue as defined in section 256B.0659.
    (d) A limit of 96 units of qualified professional supervision may be authorized for each recipient
receiving personal care assistance services. A request to the commissioner to exceed this total in a
calendar year must be requested by the personal care provider agency on a form approved by the
commissioner.

    Subd. 15. Flexible use. (a) "Flexible use" means the scheduled use of authorized hours of
personal care assistance services, which vary within a service authorization period covering no
more than six months, in order to more effectively meet the needs and schedule of the recipient.
Each 12-month service agreement is divided into two six-month authorization date spans. No more
than 75 percent of the total authorized units for a 12-month service agreement may be used in a
six-month date span.
    (b) Authorization of flexible use occurs during the authorization process under section
256B.0652. The flexible use of authorized hours does not increase the total amount of authorized
hours available to a recipient. The commissioner shall not authorize additional personal care
assistance services to supplement a service authorization that is exhausted before the end date
under a flexible service use plan, unless the assessor determines a change in condition and a need
for increased services is established. Authorized hours not used within the six-month period must
not be carried over to another time period.
    (c) A recipient who has terminated personal care assistance services before the end of the
12-month authorization period must not receive additional hours upon reapplying during the same

be prorated for the remainder of the 12-month authorization period based on the first six-month
assessment.
   (d) The recipient, responsible party, and qualified professional must develop a written
month-to-month plan of the projected use of personal care assistance services that is part of the
personal care assistance care plan and ensures:
   (1) that the health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of the
authorization period; and
    (2) that the total authorized amount of personal care assistance services for each date span must
not be used before the end of each date span in the authorization period.
    (e) The personal care assistance provider agency shall monitor the use of personal care assistance
services to ensure health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of
the authorization period. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall provide written
notice to the provider and the recipient or responsible party when a recipient is at risk of exceeding
3146                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [42ND DAY

the personal care assistance services prior to the end of the six-month period.
    (f) Misuse and abuse of the flexible use of personal care assistance services resulting in the
overuse of units in a manner where the recipient will not have enough units to meet their needs for
assistance and ensure health and safety for the entire six-month date span may lead to an action by
the commissioner. The commissioner may take action including, but not limited to: (1) restricting
recipients to service authorizations of no more than one month in duration; (2) requiring the recipient
to have a responsible party; and (3) requiring a qualified professional to monitor and report services
on a monthly basis.

   (1) the home residence or family foster care home of one or more of the individual recipients; or
    (2) a child care program licensed under chapter 245A or operated by a local school district or
private school.
   (d) Shared personal care assistance services follow the same criteria for covered services as
subdivision 2.
   (e) Noncovered shared personal care assistance services include the following:
   (1) services for more than three recipients by one personal care assistant at one time;
   (2) staff requirements for child care programs under chapter 245C;
   (3) caring for multiple recipients in more than one setting;
   (4) additional units of personal care assistance based on the selection of the option; and
   (5) use of more than one personal care assistance provider agency for the shared care services.
    (f) The option of shared personal care assistance is elected by the recipient or the responsible
party with the assistance of the assessor. The option must be determined appropriate based on the
ages of the recipients, compatibility, and coordination of their assessed care needs. The recipient or
the responsible party, in conjunction with the qualified professional, shall arrange the setting and
grouping of shared services based on the individual needs and preferences of the recipients. The
personal care assistance provider agency shall offer the recipient or the responsible party the option
of shared or one-on-one personal care assistance services or a combination of both. The recipient or
the responsible party may withdraw from participating in a shared services arrangement at any time.
    (g) Authorization for the shared service option must be determined by the commissioner based
on the criteria that the shared service is appropriate to meet all of the recipients' needs and their health
and safety is maintained. The authorization of shared services is part of the overall authorization of
personal care assistance services. Nothing in this subdivision must be construed to reduce the total

number of hours authorized for an individual recipient.
   (h) A personal care assistant providing shared personal care assistance services must:
   (1) receive training specific for each recipient served; and
   (2) follow all required documentation requirements for time and services provided.
   (i) A qualified professional shall:
    (1) evaluate the ability of the personal care assistant to provide services for all of the recipients
in a shared setting;
    (2) visit the shared setting as services are being provided at least once every six months or
whenever needed for response to a recipient's request for increased supervision of the personal care
assistance staff;
   (3) provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the
shared services;
    (4) develop a contingency plan with each of the recipients which accounts for absence of the
recipient in a share services setting due to illness or other circumstances;
   (5) obtain permission from each of the recipients who are sharing a personal care assistant for
number of shared hours for services provided inside and outside the home residence; and
   (6) document the training completed by the personal care assistants specific to the shared setting

    Subd. 17. Shared services; rates. The commissioner shall provide a rate system for shared
personal care assistance services. For two persons sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must
not exceed one and one-half times the rate paid for serving a single individual, and for three persons
sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed twice the rate paid for serving a single
individual. These rates apply only when all of the criteria for the shared care personal care assistance
service have been met.
    Subd. 18. Personal care assistance choice option; generally. (a) The commissioner may allow
a recipient of personal care assistance services to use a fiscal intermediary to assist the recipient
in paying and account for medically necessary covered personal care assistance services. Unless
otherwise provided in this section, all other statutory and regulatory provisions relating to personal
care assistance services apply to a recipient using the personal care assistance choice option.
    (b) Personal care assistance choice is an option of the personal care assistance program that
allows the recipient who receives personal care assistance services to be responsible for the hiring,
training, and firing of personal care assistants. This program offers greater control and choice for
the recipient in who provides the personal care assistance service and when the service is scheduled.
The recipient or the recipient's responsible party must choose a personal care assistance choice
provider agency as a fiscal intermediary. This personal care assistance choice provider agency
manages payroll, invoices the state, is responsible for all payroll related taxes and insurance, and is
responsible for providing the consumer training and support in managing the recipient's personal
care assistance services.

is to assist persons with long-term or chronic care needs in making long-term care decisions

applicants to Medicaid certified nursing facilities, including certified boarding care facilities, must
be screened prior to admission regardless of income, assets, or funding sources for nursing facility
care, except as described in subdivision 4b. The purpose of the screening is to determine the need
for nursing facility level of care as described in paragraph (d) and to complete activities required
under federal law related to mental illness and developmental disability as outlined in paragraph (b).
    (b) A person who has a diagnosis or possible diagnosis of mental illness or developmental
disability must receive a preadmission screening before admission regardless of the exemptions

outlined in subdivision 4b, paragraph (b), to identify the need for further evaluation and specialized
services, unless the admission prior to screening is authorized by the local mental health authority
or the local developmental disabilities case manager, or unless authorized by the county agency
according to Public Law 101-508.
     The following criteria apply to the preadmission screening:
    (1) the county must use forms and criteria developed by the commissioner to identify persons
who require referral for further evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services;
and
     (2) the evaluation and determination of the need for specialized services must be done by:
   (i) a qualified independent mental health professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of a serious mental illness; or
    (ii) a qualified developmental disability professional, for persons with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of developmental disability. For purposes of this requirement, a qualified developmental
disability professional must meet the standards for a qualified developmental disability professional
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.430.
    (c) The local county mental health authority or the state developmental disability authority under
Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508 may prohibit admission to a nursing facility if the
individual does not meet the nursing facility level of care criteria or needs specialized services as
defined in Public Law Numbers 100-203 and 101-508. For purposes of this section, "specialized
services" for a person with developmental disability means active treatment as that term is defined
under Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.440 (a)(1).
    (d) The determination of the need for nursing facility level of care must be made according to
criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, and 256B.092, using forms developed by
the commissioner. In assessing a person's needs, consultation team members shall have a physician
available for consultation and shall consider the assessment of the individual's attending physician,
if any. The individual's physician must be included if the physician chooses to participate. Other
personnel may be included on the team as deemed appropriate by the county.

     Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Payment for long-term care consultation services. (a) The total payment for each
county must be paid monthly by certified nursing facilities in the county. The monthly amount to
be paid by each nursing facility for each fiscal year must be determined by dividing the county's
annual allocation for long-term care consultation services by 12 to determine the monthly payment
3160                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [42ND DAY

and allocating the monthly payment to each nursing facility based on the number of licensed beds
in the nursing facility. Payments to counties in which there is no certified nursing facility must be
made by increasing the payment rate of the two facilities located nearest to the county seat.
    (b) The commissioner shall include the total annual payment determined under paragraph (a)
for each nursing facility reimbursed under section 256B.431 or 256B.434 according to section
256B.431, subdivision 2b, paragraph (g).
    (c) In the event of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway of 25
percent or more of the beds in a facility, the commissioner may adjust the per diem payment amount
in paragraph (b) and may adjust the monthly payment amount in paragraph (a). The effective date
of an adjustment made under this paragraph shall be on or after the first day of the month following
the effective date of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway.
   (d) Payments for long-term care consultation services are available to the county or counties to
cover staff salaries and expenses to provide the services described in subdivision 1a. The county
shall employ, or contract with other agencies to employ, within the limits of available funding,
sufficient personnel to provide long-term care consultation services while meeting the state's
long-term care outcomes and objectives as defined in section 256B.0917, subdivision 1. The
county shall be accountable for meeting local objectives as approved by the commissioner in the
biennial home and community-based services quality assurance plan on a form provided by the
commissioner.
   (e) Notwithstanding section 256B.0641, overpayments attributable to payment of the screening
costs under the medical assistance program may not be recovered from a facility.
    (f) The commissioner of human services shall amend the Minnesota medical assistance plan to
include reimbursement for the local consultation teams.
    (g) The county may bill, as case management services, assessments, support planning, and
follow-along provided to persons determined to be eligible for case management under Minnesota
health care programs. No individual or family member shall be charged for an initial assessment or
initial support plan development provided under subdivision 3a or 3b.
   (h) The commissioner shall develop an alternative payment methodology for long-term care
consultation services that includes the funding available under this subdivision, and sections
256B.092 and 256B.0659. In developing the new payment methodology, the commissioner shall
consider the maximization of federal funding for this activity.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0911, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Reimbursement for certified nursing facilities. (a) Medical assistance reimbursement
for nursing facilities shall be authorized for a medical assistance recipient only if a preadmission
screening has been conducted prior to admission or the county has authorized an exemption. Medical
assistance reimbursement for nursing facilities shall not be provided for any recipient who the local
screener has determined does not meet the level of care criteria for nursing facility placement in
section 144.0724, subdivision 11, or, if indicated, has not had a level II OBRA evaluation as required
under the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 completed unless an admission for a
recipient with mental illness is approved by the local mental health authority or an admission for a
recipient with developmental disability is approved by the state developmental disability authority.

    (b) The nursing facility must not bill a person who is not a medical assistance recipient
for resident days that preceded the date of completion of screening activities as required under
subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c. The nursing facility must include unreimbursed resident days in the
nursing facility resident day totals reported to the commissioner.
     Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0913, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility for funding for services for nonmedical assistance recipients. (a) Funding
for services under the alternative care program is available to persons who meet the following
criteria:
    (1) the person has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911 to
be a person who would require the level of care provided in a nursing facility according to the
criteria established in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, but for the provision of services under the
alternative care program;
     (2) the person is age 65 or older;
    (3) the person would be eligible for medical assistance within 135 days of admission to a nursing
facility;
    (4) the person is not ineligible for the payment of long-term care services by the medical
assistance program due to an asset transfer penalty under section 256B.0595 or equity interest in
the home exceeding $500,000 as stated in section 256B.056;
   (5) the person needs long-term care services that are not funded through other state or federal
funding;
    (6) the monthly cost of the alternative care services funded by the program for this person does
not exceed 75 percent of the monthly limit described under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a. This
monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services, but
in no case may the cost of additional services purchased under this section exceed the difference
between the client's monthly service limit defined under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3, and the
alternative care program monthly service limit defined in this paragraph. If care-related supplies and
equipment or environmental modifications and adaptations are or will be purchased for an alternative
care services recipient, the costs may be prorated on a monthly basis for up to 12 consecutive months
beginning with the month of purchase. If the monthly cost of a recipient's other alternative care
services exceeds the monthly limit established in this paragraph, the annual cost of the alternative
care services shall be determined. In this event, the annual cost of alternative care services shall not
exceed 12 times the monthly limit described in this paragraph; and
     (7) the person is making timely payments of the assessed monthly fee.
A person is ineligible if payment of the fee is over 60 days past due, unless the person agrees to:
     (i) the appointment of a representative payee;
     (ii) automatic payment from a financial account;
     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
3162                                         JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                 [42ND DAY

     (iv) another method acceptable to the lead agency to ensure prompt fee payments.
    The lead agency may extend the client's eligibility as necessary while making arrangements to
facilitate payment of past-due amounts and future premium payments. Following disenrollment due
to nonpayment of a monthly fee, eligibility shall not be reinstated for a period of 30 days.
    (b) Alternative care funding under this subdivision is not available for a person who is a medical
assistance recipient or who would be eligible for medical assistance without a spenddown or waiver
obligation. A person whose initial application for medical assistance and the elderly waiver program
is being processed may be served under the alternative care program for a period up to 60 days. If
the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for
services payable under the federally approved elderly waiver plan and delivered from the date the
individual was found eligible for the federally approved elderly waiver plan. Notwithstanding this
provision, alternative care funds may not be used to pay for any service the cost of which: (i) is
payable by medical assistance; (ii) is used by a recipient to meet a waiver obligation; or (iii) is used
to pay a medical assistance income spenddown for a person who is eligible to participate in the
federally approved elderly waiver program under the special income standard provision.
    (c) Alternative care funding is not available for a person who resides in a licensed nursing home,
certified boarding care home, hospital, or intermediate care facility, except for case management
services which are provided in support of the discharge planning process for a nursing home resident
or certified boarding care home resident to assist with a relocation process to a community-based
setting.
    (d) Alternative care funding is not available for a person whose income is greater than the
maintenance needs allowance under section 256B.0915, subdivision 1d, but equal to or less than
120 percent of the federal poverty guideline effective July 1 in the fiscal year for which alternative
care eligibility is determined, who would be eligible for the elderly waiver with a waiver obligation.

with the payment for other elderly waiver services, including case management, must not exceed
the recipient's community budget cap specified in subdivision 3a. Customized living services must
not include rent or raw food costs.
    (f) The individually authorized 24-hour customized living payment rates shall not exceed
the 95 percentile of statewide monthly authorizations for 24-hour customized living services in
effect and in the Medicaid management information systems on March 31, 2009, for each case
mix resident class under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to which elderly waiver
service clients are assigned. When there are fewer than 50 authorizations in effect in the case mix
resident class, the commissioner shall multiply the calculated service payment rate maximum for
the A classification by the standard weight for that classification under Minnesota Rules, parts
9549.0050 to 9549.0059, to determine the applicable payment rate maximum. Service payment
rate maximums shall be updated annually based on legislatively adopted changes to all service
rates for home and community-based service providers.
   (g) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (f), the commissioner may establish
an alternative payment rate system for 24-hour customized living services by applying a single
hourly rate for direct services provided in establishments, which meet the following criteria:
   (1) 24-hour customized living services must be provided in a shared living unit; and
   (2) the unit is licensed as an adult foster care for no more than five residents or licensed as a
board and lodge facility with no more than ten residents.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Assessments and reassessments for waiver clients. (a) Each client shall receive an
initial assessment of strengths, informal supports, and need for services in accordance with section
256B.0911, subdivisions 3, 3a, and 3b. A reassessment of a client served under the elderly waiver
must be conducted at least every 12 months and at other times when the case manager determines
that there has been significant change in the client's functioning. This may include instances where
the client is discharged from the hospital. There must be a determination that the client requires
nursing facility level of care as defined in section 144.0724, subdivision 11, at initial and subsequent
assessments to initiate and maintain participation in the waiver program.
    (b) Regardless of other assessments identified in section 144.0724, subdivision 4, as appropriate
to determine nursing facility level of care for purposes of medical assistance payment for nursing
facility services, only face-to-face assessments conducted according to section 256B.0911,
subdivisions 3a and 3b, that result in a nursing facility level of care determination will be accepted
for purposes of initial and ongoing access to waiver service payment.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 10. Waiver payment rates; managed care organizations. The commissioner shall
adjust the elderly waiver capitation payment rates for managed care organizations paid under
section 256B.69, subdivisions 6a and 23, to reflect the maximum service rate limits for customized

contract period beginning January 1, 2010. Medical assistance rates paid to customized living
providers by managed care organizations under this section shall not exceed the maximum service
rate limits determined by the commissioner under subdivisions 3e and 3h.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0917, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 14. Essential community supports grants. (a) The purpose of the essential community
supports grant program is to provide targeted services to persons 65 years and older who need
essential community support, but whose needs do not meet the level of care required for nursing
facility placement under section 144.0724, subdivision 11.
  (b) Within the limits of the appropriation and not to exceed $400 per person per month, funding
must be available to a person who:
   (1) is age 65 or older;
   (2) is not eligible for medical assistance;
   (3) would otherwise be financially eligible for the alternative care program under section
256B.0913, subdivision 4;
   (4) has received a community assessment under section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a or 3b, and
does not require the level of care provided in a nursing facility;
   (5) has a community support plan; and
    (6) has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911, subdivision 3a or
3b, to be a person who would require provision of at least one of the following services, as defined
in the approved elderly waiver plan, in order to maintain their community residence:
   (i) caregiver support;
   (ii) homemaker;
   (iii) chore; or
   (iv) a personal emergency response device or system.
    (c) The person receiving any of the essential community supports in this subdivision must also
receive service coordination as part of their community support plan.
    (d) A person who has been determined to be eligible for an essential community support grant
must be reassessed at least annually and continue to meet the criteria in paragraph (b) to remain
eligible for an essential community support grant.
    (e) The commissioner shall allocate grants to counties and tribes under contract with the
department based upon the historic use of the medical assistance elderly waiver and alternative
care grant programs and other criteria as determined by the commissioner.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, subdivision 8a, is amended to read:

from the proposed county of service and the placement shall be made cooperatively between the
two counties. Arrangements shall be made between the two counties for ongoing social service,
including annual reviews of the person's individual service plan. The county where services are
provided may not make changes in the person's service plan without approval by the county of
financial responsibility.
     (b) When a person has been screened and authorized for services in an intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities or for home and community-based services for persons
with developmental disabilities, the case manager shall assist that person in identifying a service
provider who is able to meet the needs of the person according to the person's individual service plan.
If the identified service is to be provided in a county other than the county of financial responsibility,
the county of financial responsibility shall request concurrence of the county where the person is
requesting to receive the identified services. The county of service may refuse to concur if:
    (1) it can demonstrate that the provider is unable to provide the services identified in the person's
individual service plan as services that are needed and are to be provided; or
    (2) in the case of an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
there has been no authorization for admission by the admission review team as required in section

    (­) (b) Every year, the commissioner shall survey rates charged by child care providers in
     c­
Minnesota to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in counties. When the
commissioner determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol, the number of
providers responding to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate for like-care
arrangements in a county or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the 75th
percentile maximum rate based on like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that the
commissioner deems to be similar.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (c) A rate which includes a special needs rate paid under subdivision 3 or under a school
readiness service agreement paid under section 119B.231, may be in excess of the maximum rate
allowed under this subdivision.
   ­
   (­ ) (d) The department shall monitor the effect of this paragraph on provider rates. The county
     e­
shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The
commissioner shall determine the maximum rate for each type of care on an hourly, full-day, and
weekly basis, including special needs and disability care.
    ­
    (­) (e) When the provider charge is greater than the maximum provider rate allowed, the parent
     f­
is responsible for payment of the difference in the rates in addition to any family co-payment fee.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (f) All maximum provider rates changes shall be implemented on the Monday following the
effective date of the maximum provider rate.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 119B.13, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Provider payments. (a) Counties or the state shall make vendor payments to the child
care provider or pay the parent directly for eligible child care expenses.
    (b) If payments for child care assistance are made to providers, the provider shall bill the county
for services provided within ten days of the end of the service period. If bills are submitted within
ten days of the end of the service period, a county or the state shall issue payment to the provider of
child care under the child care fund within 30 days of receiving a bill from the provider. Counties
or the state may establish policies that make payments on a more frequent basis.

                  ­ If a provider has received an authorization of care and been issued a billing form for
an eligible family, the bill must be submitted within 60 days of the last date of service on the bill.
A county may pay a bill submitted more than 60 days after the last date of service if the provider
shows good cause why the bill was not submitted within 60 days. Good cause must be defined in
the county's child care fund plan under section 119B.08, subdivision 3, and the definition of good
cause must include county error. A county may not pay any bill submitted more than a year after
the last date of service on the bill.

    (d) If a provider provided care for a time period without receiving an authorization of care and a
billing form for an eligible family, payment of child care assistance may only be made retroactively
for a maximum of six months from the date the provider is issued an authorization of care and billing
form.
   ­(d
     ­­) (e) A county may stop payment issued to a provider or may refuse to pay a bill submitted by
a provider if:
   (1) the provider admits to intentionally giving the county materially false information on the
provider's billing forms; or
   (2) a county finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the provider intentionally gave the
county materially false information on the provider's billing forms.
    ­
    (­) (f) A county's payment policies must be included in the county's child care plan under section
     e­
119B.08, subdivision 3. If payments are made by the state, in addition to being in compliance with
this subdivision, the payments must be made in compliance with section 16A.124.

agency shall apply any excess loan value as if it were equity value to the asset limit described in
this section,    ­. If the assistance unit owns more than one licensed vehicle, the county agency shall
determine the vehicle with the highest loan value and count only the loan value over $7,500,
excluding: (i) the value of one vehicle per physically disabled person when the vehicle is needed to
transport the disabled unit member; this exclusion does not apply to mentally disabled people; (ii)
the value of special equipment for a disabled member of the assistance unit; and (iii) any vehicle
used for long-distance travel, other than daily commuting, for the employment of a unit member.
    The county agency shall count the loan value of all other vehicles and apply this amount as if it
were equity value to the asset limit described in this section. To establish the loan value of vehicles,
a county agency must use the N.A.D.A. Official Used Car Guide, Midwest Edition, for newer model
cars. When a vehicle is not listed in the guidebook, or when the applicant or participant disputes
the loan value listed in the guidebook as unreasonable given the condition of the particular vehicle,
the county agency may require the applicant or participant document the loan value by securing a
written statement from a motor vehicle dealer licensed under section 168.27, stating the amount that
the dealer would pay to purchase the vehicle. The county agency shall reimburse the applicant or
participant for the cost of a written statement that documents a lower loan value;
     (2) the value of life insurance policies for members of the assistance unit;
     (3) one burial plot per member of an assistance unit;

    (4) the value of personal property needed to produce earned income, including tools,
implements, farm animals, inventory, business loans, business checking and savings accounts used

   (5) the value of personal property not otherwise specified which is commonly used by household
members in day-to-day living such as clothing, necessary household furniture, equipment, and other
basic maintenance items essential for daily living;
   (6) the value of real and personal property owned by a recipient of Supplemental Security Income
or Minnesota supplemental aid;
   (7) the value of corrective payments, but only for the month in which the payment is received
and for the following month;
    (8) a mobile home or other vehicle used by an applicant or participant as the applicant's or
participant's home;
    (9) money in a separate escrow account that is needed to pay real estate taxes or insurance and
that is used for this purpose;
   (10) money held in escrow to cover employee FICA, employee tax withholding, sales tax
withholding, employee worker compensation, business insurance, property rental, property taxes,
and other costs that are paid at least annually, but less often than monthly;
    (11) monthly assistance payments for the current month's or short-term emergency needs under
section 256J.626, subdivision 2;
   (12) the value of school loans, grants, or scholarships for the period they are intended to cover;
    (13) payments listed in section 256J.21, subdivision 2, clause (9), which are held in escrow for
a period not to exceed three months to replace or repair personal or real property;
   (14) income received in a budget month through the end of the payment month;
   (15) savings from earned income of a minor child or a minor parent that are set aside in a separate
account designated specifically for future education or employment costs;
    (16) the federal earned income credit, Minnesota working family credit, state and federal income
tax refunds, state homeowners and renters credits under chapter 290A, property tax rebates and other
federal or state tax rebates in the month received and the following month;

account from any nonexcluded funds;

assistance payments are made on their behalf; and

the first grant reduction. The notice must inform the participant of the basis for the potential grant
reduction, the exceptions to the provision, if any, and inform the participant of the steps necessary

     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.37, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Treatment of Supplemental Security Income. Effective March 1, 2010, the county
shall reduce the cash portion of the MFIP grant by up to $125 for an MFIP assistance unit that
includes one or more Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients who reside in the household,
and who would otherwise be included in the MFIP assistance unit under section 256J.24, subdivision
2, but are excluded solely due to the SSI recipient status under section 256J.24, subdivision 3,
paragraph (a), clause (1). If the SSI recipient or recipients receive less than $125 of SSI, only the
amount received must be used in calculating the MFIP cash assistance payment. This provision does
not apply to relative caregivers who could elect to be included in the MFIP assistance unit under
section 256J.24, subdivision 4, unless the caregiver's children or stepchildren are included in the
MFIP assistance unit.

determine the percentage of the county's current caseload that is transferring to a tribal program and
adjust the affected county's allocation accordingly; and
    (2) in the case where a portion of the responsibilities under this section are transferred to a
tribal program, the commissioner shall consult with the affected county or counties to determine an
appropriate adjustment to the allocation.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.751, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. County performance standards. (a) For the purpose of this section, the following
terms have the meanings given:
   (1) "Caseload reduction credit" (CRC) means the measure of how much the Minnesota TANF
caseload, including the separate state program caseload, has fallen relative to the federal fiscal year
2005 caseload based on caseload data from October 1 to September 30.

    (2) "TANF participation rate target" means a 50 percent participation rate reduced by the CRC
as calculated by the Department of Human Services.
   (b) A county or tribe shall negotiate a multiyear improvement plan with the commissioner if the
county or tribe does not:
   (1) achieve the TANF participation rate target or a five percentage point improvement over the
county or tribe's previous year's TANF participation rate under subdivision 2, clause (7), as averaged
across 12 consecutive months for the most recent year for which the measurements are available; or
    (2) perform within or above its range of expected performance on the annualized three-year
self-support index under subdivision 2, clause (6).
    (c) A county or tribe that has successfully negotiated an improvement plan must provide a
semiannual report indicating that the plan has been implemented, the impact of the plan, and any
anticipated changes to the plan.
     Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.95, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
     Subd. 12. Conversion or referral to MFIP. (a) If at any time during the DWP application
process or during the four-month DWP eligibility period, it is determined that a participant is
unlikely to benefit from the diversionary work program, the county shall convert or refer the
participant to MFIP as specified in paragraph (d). Participants who are determined to be unlikely
to benefit from the diversionary work program must develop and sign an employment plan.

    (d) A participant who is determined to be unlikely to benefit from the diversionary work
program shall be converted to MFIP and, if the determination was made within 30 days of the
initial application for benefits, no additional application form is required. A participant who is
determined to be unlikely to benefit from the diversionary work program shall be referred to MFIP
and, if the determination is made more than 30 days after the initial application, the participant
must submit a program change request form. The county agency shall process the program change
request form by the first of the following month to ensure that no gap in benefits is due to delayed
action by the county agency. In processing the program change request form, the county must
follow section 256J.32, subdivision 1, except that the county agency shall not require additional
verification of the information in the case file from the DWP application unless the information in
the case file is inaccurate, questionable, or no longer current.
    (e) The county shall not request a combined application form for a participant who has
exhausted the four months of the diversionary work program, has continued need for cash and food
assistance, and has completed, signed, and submitted a program change request form within 30
days of the fourth month of the diversionary work program. The county must process the program
change request according to section 256J.32, subdivision 1, except that the county agency shall not
require additional verification of information in the case file unless the information is inaccurate,
questionable, or no longer current. When a participant does not request MFIP within 30 days of
the diversionary work program benefits being exhausted, a new combined application form must
be completed for any subsequent request for MFIP.

                 , where the recipient requests temporary assistance not exceeding 30 days if an
emergency situation appears to exist under criteria adopted by the county agency and the individual
or family is ineligible for MFIP or DWP or is not a participant of MFIP or DWP and whose annual
net income is no greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty level for the previous calendar year.
If an applicant or recipient relates facts to the county agency which may be sufficient to constitute
an emergency situation, the county agency shall, to the extent funds are available, advise the person
of the procedure for applying for assistance according to this subdivision. An emergency general
assistance grant is available to a recipient not more than once in any 12-month period.
    (b) Funding for an emergency general assistance program is limited to the appropriation. Each
fiscal year, the commissioner shall allocate to counties the money appropriated for emergency
general assistance grants based on each county agency's average share of state's emergency general
expenditures for the immediate past three fiscal years as determined by the commissioner, and may

reallocate any unspent amounts to other counties.
     (c) No county shall be allocated less than $1,000 for the fiscal year.
   (d) Should an emergency be declared as provided in section 12.31, the commissioner may
immediately reallocate unspent funds without regard to the other provisions of this section to
meet the emergency needs. The emergency reallocation must be excluded from calculations for
subsequent allocations as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c).
   (e) Any emergency general assistance expenditures by a county above the amount of the
commissioner's allocation to the county must be made from county funds.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256D.09, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Recovery of overpayments. (a) If an amount of general assistance or family general
assistance is paid to a recipient in excess of the payment due, it shall be recoverable by the
county agency. The agency shall give written notice to the recipient of its intention to recover the
overpayment.
    (b) Except as provided for interim assistance in section 256D.06, subdivision 5, when an
overpayment occurs, the county agency shall recover the overpayment from a current recipient by
reducing the amount of aid payable to the assistance unit of which the recipient is a member, for
one or more monthly assistance payments, until the overpayment is repaid. All county agencies in
the state shall reduce the assistance payment by three percent of the assistance unit's standard of
need in nonfraud cases and ten percent where fraud has occurred, or the amount of the monthly
payment, whichever is less, for all overpayments.
   (c) In cases when there is both an overpayment and underpayment, the county agency shall offset
one against the other in correcting the payment.
    (d) Overpayments may also be voluntarily repaid, in part or in full, by the individual, in addition
to the aid reductions provided in this subdivision, to include further voluntary reductions in the grant
level agreed to in writing by the individual, until the total amount of the overpayment is repaid.
    (e) The county agency shall make reasonable efforts to recover overpayments to persons no
longer on assistance under standards adopted in rule by the commissioner of human services. The
county agency need not attempt to recover overpayments of less than $35 paid to an individual no
longer on assistance if the individual does not receive assistance again within three years, unless the
individual has been convicted of violating section 256.98.
    (f) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months prior to the month of discovery due
to an agency error and six years prior to the month of discovery due to a client error or an intentional
program violation determined under section 256.046.

      Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256D.49, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Overpayment of monthly grants and recovery of ATM errors. (a) When the
county agency determines that an overpayment of the recipient's monthly payment of Minnesota
supplemental aid has occurred, it shall issue a notice of overpayment to the recipient. If the person
is no longer receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the county agency may request voluntary
repayment or pursue civil recovery. If the person is receiving Minnesota supplemental aid, the
county agency shall recover the overpayment by withholding an amount equal to three percent of
the standard of assistance for the recipient or the total amount of the monthly grant, whichever is
less.
    (b) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months prior to the month of discovery due
to an agency error and six years prior to the month of discovery due to a client error or an intentional
program violation determined under section 256.046.
    (c) For recipients receiving benefits via electronic benefit transfer, if the overpayment is a result
of an automated teller machine (ATM) dispensing funds in error to the recipient, the agency may
recover the ATM error by immediately withdrawing funds from the recipient's electronic benefit
transfer account, up to the amount of the error.

countable income means actual income less any applicable exclusions and disregards.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.38, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Scope of overpayment. (a) When a participant or former participant receives an
overpayment due to agency, client, or ATM error, or due to assistance received while an appeal is
pending and the participant or former participant is determined ineligible for assistance or for less
assistance than was received, the county agency must recoup or recover the overpayment using the
following methods:
   (1) reconstruct each affected budget month and corresponding payment month;
   (2) use the policies and procedures that were in effect for the payment month; and
    (3) do not allow employment disregards in section 256J.21, subdivision 3 or 4, in the calculation
of the overpayment when the unit has not reported within two calendar months following the end
of the month in which the income was received.
   (b) Establishment of an overpayment is limited to 12 months prior to the month of discovery
due to agency error and six years prior to the month of discovery due to client error or an intentional

commissioner of human services, the supervision of the commissioner as specified in section
256.01, and all federal laws and regulations. The commissioner of human services shall monitor
food stamp program delivery on an ongoing basis to ensure that each county complies with federal
laws and regulations. Program requirements to be monitored include, but are not limited to, number
of applications, number of approvals, number of cases pending, length of time required to process
each application and deliver benefits, number of applicants eligible for expedited issuance, length
of time required to process and deliver expedited issuance, number of terminations and reasons for
terminations, client profiles by age, household composition and income level and sources, and the
use of phone certification and home visits. The commissioner shall determine the county-by-county
and statewide participation rate.
    (b) On July 1 of each year, the commissioner of human services shall determine a statewide
and county-by-county food stamp program participation rate. The commissioner may designate a
different agency to administer the food stamp program in a county if the agency administering
the program fails to increase the food stamp program participation rate among families or eligible
individuals, or comply with all federal laws and regulations governing the food stamp program.
The commissioner shall review agency performance annually to determine compliance with this
paragraph.
   (c) A person who commits any of the following acts has violated section 256.98 or 609.821, or

less than 30 days to allow any affected person to appeal the confiscation under section 256.045.

action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written request for a
hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action, decision,
or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or

Services or a county agency. The scope of the appeal is the validity of the claimant agency's intention
to request setoff of a refund under chapter 270A against the debt.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.

(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement
under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care
payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.

prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (g) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.

   Sec. 3. [256.9832] STATE WELFARE FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Program established. Effective July 1, 2009, the commissioner of human
services shall establish a welfare fraud investigative unit to investigate allegations of recipient
fraud in welfare programs with a state or federal funding component and quickly terminate benefits
to ineligible recipients. Counties that received grants under Minnesota Statutes 2008, section
256.983, for the fraud prevention investigation project must use state investigators to investigate
possible welfare fraud effective with termination of their grants. The commissioner shall develop a
process for counties that did not participate in the former fraud prevention investigation project to
begin use of state investigators.
    Subd. 2. Relationship to county criminal welfare fraud investigative units. An investigation
resulting in discovery of facts that appear to merit the involvement of the criminal justice system
are to be referred to the county human services director or designee for further referral to the
county criminal justice system, or may be referred directly to the county criminal justice system.
The commissioner of human services must be notified of the disposition of these cases within six
months of referral. If the criminal justice system has not acted on the referral or declined to act, the
commissioner has the option to pursue further action on those cases.
    Subd. 3. County agency responsibilities. State welfare fraud investigators shall have
unrestricted access to human services records as needed to conduct an investigation. County
agencies have 30 days after receipt of investigative findings to notify the commissioner of effect on
eligibility. County agencies shall calculate overpayments identified through an investigation and
establish a formal claim for repayment within 45 days of discovery.
    Subd. 4. Department responsibilities. The commissioner shall establish training programs
for state investigators, county welfare case workers, and supervisory staff. The commissioner
shall develop operational guidelines, forms, and reporting mechanisms, which must be used by
county agencies. The commissioner shall develop a process to ensure county cooperation with
making appropriate referrals for welfare fraud investigations. An individuals's application or
redetermination form for public assistance benefits, including child care assistance programs and
medical care programs, must include an authorization by the individual for the release and sharing
of information and documentation between third parties and investigators who are conducting
welfare fraud investigations. The authorization for release and sharing of information is effective
for six months after public assistance benefits have ceased.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective November 1, 2009.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270A.09, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Department of Human Services claims. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, any debtor
contesting a setoff claim by the Department of Human Services or a county agency whose claim
relates to a debt resulting from receipt of public assistance, medical care, or the federal Food Stamp
Act shall have a hearing conducted in the same manner as an appeal under sections 256.045 and
256.0451.

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518A.53, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Collection services. (a) The commissioner of human services shall prepare and make
available to the courts a notice of services that explains child support and maintenance collection
services available through the public authority, including income withholding, and the fees for
such services. Upon receiving a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, the court
administrator shall promptly send the notice of services to the petitioner and respondent at the
addresses stated in the petition.
    (b) Either the obligee or obligor may at any time apply to the public authority for either full IV-D
services or for income withholding only services.
    (c) For those persons applying for income withholding only services, a monthly service fee of
$15 must be charged to the obligor. This fee is in addition to the amount of the support order and
shall be withheld through income withholding. The public authority shall explain the service options
in this section to the affected parties and encourage the application for full child support collection
services.
    (d) If the obligee is not a current recipient of public assistance as defined in section 256.741, the
person who applied for services may at any time choose to terminate either full IV-D services or
income withholding only services regardless of whether income withholding is currently in place.
The obligee or obligor may reapply for either full IV-D services or income withholding only services
at any time. Unless the applicant is a recipient of public assistance as defined in section 256.741, a
$25 application fee shall be charged at the time of each application.
    (e) When a person terminates IV-D services, if an arrearage for public assistance as defined
in section 256.741 exists, the public authority may continue income withholding, as well as use
any other enforcement remedy for the collection of child support, until all public assistance arrears
are paid in full. Income withholding shall be in an amount equal to 20 percent of the support
order in effect at the time the services terminated.
                                                   ­, unless the support order includes a specific
monthly payback amount. If the support order includes a specific monthly payback amount, income
withholding shall be in the specific amount ordered. The provisions of this paragraph apply to

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518A.53, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Arrearage order. (a) This section does not prevent the court from ordering the payor
of funds to withhold amounts to satisfy the obligor's previous arrearage in support order payments.
This remedy shall not operate to exclude availability of other remedies to enforce judgments. The
employer or payor of funds shall withhold from the obligor's income an additional amount equal
to 20 percent of the monthly child support or maintenance obligation until the arrearage is paid. ­,
unless the support order includes a specific monthly payback amount. If the support order includes
a specific monthly payback amount, income withholding shall be in the specific amount ordered.
The provisions of this paragraph apply to all support orders in effect on or before January 1, 2010,
and to all support orders in effect after January 1, 2010.
   (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, funds from income sources included in section
518A.26, subdivision 8, whether periodic or lump sum, are not exempt from attachment or execution
upon a judgment for child support arrearage.
    (c) Absent an order to the contrary, if an arrearage exists at the time a support order would
otherwise terminate, income withholding shall continue in effect or may be implemented in an
amount equal to the support order plus an additional 20 percent of the monthly child support
obligation, until all arrears have been paid in full.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective April 1, 2010.

          PROTECTING CHILDREN AND STRENGTHENING FAMILIES ACT
   Section 1. [256N.01] CITATION.
    Sections 256N.01 to 256N.09 may be cited as the "Protecting Children and Strengthening
Families Act," hereafter the "act." This act defines public child welfare policy, sets state priorities,
creates accountability mechanisms for achieving improved outcomes for children and families,
and establishes a fund to address the safety, permanency, and well-being needs of children and
adolescents who come to the attention of the county as a result of a report of child maltreatment
pursuant to section 626.556 or are otherwise the responsibility of the county.
   Sec. 2. [256N.02] PUBLIC POLICY.
   Subdivision 1. General. The legislature hereby declares that the public policy of the state is:
   (1) first and foremost, children should be safe from harm and protected from abuse and neglect;
   (2) children should be maintained safely in their homes whenever possible and appropriate;
    (3) when the ability of parents to keep their children safe is compromised it is in the public
interest to intervene early and provide services that promote parents' protective capacities, mitigate
risks of harm, and strengthen and support parents in their care giving roles;
    (4) children should grow up in safe, permanent and nurturing homes and, when it is not possible
for their parents to provide safety and permanency, alternative permanency options must be made
available to children as quickly as possible;
    (5) whenever possible, alternative permanency options should be with children's relatives or
kin in order to maintain family relationships and preserve connections with their communities and
culture; and
   (6) once permanency is achieved, children and their families should receive the services and
supports necessary to maintain safe, stable, and permanent homes.
    Subd. 2. Racial disparities in child welfare. It is further the policy of the state to reduce racial
disparities and disproportionality that exists in the child welfare system by:
   (1) identifying and addressing structural factors contributing to inequities in outcomes;
3196                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [42ND DAY

    (2) identifying and implementing promising and evidence-based strategies to reduce racial
disparities in treatment and outcomes;
   (3) using cultural values, beliefs and practices of families, communities and tribes to shape
family assessment, case planning, case service design, and case decision making processes;
   (4) using placement and reunification strategies that maintain, honor, and support relationships
and connections between parents, siblings, children, kin, and significant others, giving priority to
kinship placements when placement is necessary; and
   (5) supporting families in the context of their communities and tribes so as to safely divert them
away from the child welfare system, whenever possible.
   Sec. 3. [256N.03] PUBLIC PRIORITIES.
    A broad continuum of services and a reform of practice are necessary across Minnesota to keep
children safe from abuse and neglect, prevent the trauma associated with removing a child from
their family home, and provide families with the necessary supports and services to protect and
nurture their children. Successful implementation of state policy must result in improved outcomes
for children and families and must be measured by:
   (1) improved timeliness to initial investigations;
   (2) increased monthly caseworker visits;
   (3) reduced out-of-home placements;
   (4) reduced re-entry;
   (5) reduced recidivism;
   (6) reduced number of children aging out of foster care without achieving permanency;
   (7) improved rate of relative care;
   (8) improved stability in foster care; and
   (9) reduced racial and ethnic disparities and disproportionality.

   Sec. 5. [256O.001] CITATION.
    Sections 256O.001 to 256O.270 may be cited as the "Northstar Care for Children Act." Sections
256O.001 to 256O.270 establish Northstar Care for Children, which authorizes certain benefits to
support children in need who are served by the Minnesota child welfare system and who are the
responsibility of the state of Minnesota, local county social service agencies, or tribal social service
agencies under section 256.01, subdivision 14b. A child eligible for the benefit has experienced a
child welfare intervention that has resulted in the child being placed away from the child's parents'
care and is receiving foster care services under chapter 260B, 260C, or 260D or is in the permanent
care of relatives through a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody, or in the permanent
care of adoptive parents.
   Sec. 6. [256O.01] PUBLIC POLICY.
   (a) The legislature hereby declares that the public policy of this state is to keep children safe
from harm and to ensure that when children suffer harmful or injurious experiences in their lives,
appropriate services are immediately available to keep them safe.
    (b) Children do best in permanent, safe, nurturing homes with long-term relationships with
adults. Whenever safely possible, children are best served when they can be nurtured and raised
by their parents. Where services cannot be provided to allow a child to remain safely at home, an
out-of-home placement may be required. When this occurs, reunification should be sought if it can
be accomplished safely. When it is not possible for parents to provide safety and permanency for
their children, an alternative permanent home must quickly be made available to the child, drawing
from kinship sources whenever possible.
    (c) Minnesota understands the importance of having a comprehensive approach to temporary
out-of-home care and to permanent homes for children who cannot be reunited with their families.
It is critical that stable benefits be available to caregivers to ensure that the child's needs can
be met whether the child's situation and best interests call for temporary foster care, transfer
of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative, or adoption. Northstar Care for Children
focuses on the child's needs and strengths, and the actual level of care provided by the caregiver,
without consideration for the type of placement setting. In this way, caregivers are not faced with
the burden of making specific long-term decisions based upon competing financial incentives.

a similar provision under tribal code which means that the individual responsible for the child has
responsibility for the protection, education, care, and control of the child and decision making on

assistance, the following judicial determinations regarding permanency must be made for the child
prior to the transfer of permanent legal and physical custody:
    (1) a judicial determination that reunification and adoption are not appropriate permanency
options for the child; and
    (2) a judicial determination that the child demonstrates a strong attachment to the prospective
relative custodian and the relative custodian has a strong commitment to caring permanently for the
child.
    Subd. 3. Citizenship and immigration status. (a) A child must be a citizen of the United

payments on behalf of an otherwise eligible child.
    (b) An otherwise eligible prospective relative custodian who possesses one of the felony
convictions in paragraph (a) may receive state-funded guardianship assistance payments on behalf
of an otherwise eligible child if the court has made a judicial determination that:

assistance agreements under section 257.85 must terminate. A child who has a relative custody
assistance agreement executed on the child's behalf under section 257.85 on or before November

       (3) membership in a sibling group being adopted at the same time by the same parent;
    (4) adoptive placement in the home of a parent who previously adopted another child born of
the same mother or father for whom they receive adoption assistance; or

    (ii) a determination by the commissioner that such a search would not be in the best interests of
the child; and
   (2) a written statement from the identified prospective adoptive parents that they are either
unwilling or unable to adopt the child without adoption assistance.

appropriate adoptive placement for the child, the placing agency must provide documentation of
the placement decision to the commissioner as part of the application for adoption assistance. If
two or more appropriate families are not approved or available within the placing agency, the
agency shall locate additional prospective adoptive families by registering the child with the state
adoption exchange, as defined in section 259.75. If registration with the state adoption exchange
does not result in an appropriate family for the child, the agency shall employ other recruitment
methods as outlined in recruitment policies and procedures prescribed by the commissioner, to
meet this requirement.
    (f) The requirement for a documented search for an appropriate adoptive placement including a
review of all families approved for adoption that are associated with the placing agency, registration
of the child with the state adoption exchange, and additional recruitment methods must be waived
if:

emotional ties while in the foster parents' care as a foster child; or
    (3) the child is being adopted by a family that previously adopted a child of the same mother or
father;
and the court determines that adoption by the identified family is in the child's best interest. For
an Indian child covered by the Indian Child Welfare Act, a waiver must not be granted unless the
placing agency has complied with the placement preferences identified in the Indian Child Welfare
Act and the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act.
     (g) Once the placing agency has determined that placement with an identified family is in the
child's best interest and made full written disclosure about the child's social and medical history,
the agency must ask the prospective adoptive parents if they are willing to adopt the child without
adoption assistance. If the identified family is either unwilling or unable to adopt the child without
adoption assistance, they must provide a written statement to this effect to the placing agency to
fulfill the requirement to make a reasonable effort to place the child without adoption assistance,
and a copy of this statement shall be included in the adoption assistance application. If the identified
family desires to adopt the child without adoption assistance, they must provide a written statement
to this effect to the placing agency and the statement shall be maintained in the permanent adoption
record of the placing agency. For children under the commissioner's guardianship, the placing
agency shall submit a copy of this statement to the commissioner to be maintained in the permanent
adoption record.

assistance agreement, and making any adoption assistance payments outlined in the new agreement.
    Subd. 10. Extension, past age 18. Under certain limited circumstances, a child may qualify
for extension of the adoption assistance agreement beyond the date the child attains age 18. An
application for extension must be completed and submitted by the adoptive parent at least 90 days

Children must be renegotiated according to the process in section 256O.270. All eligible children
whose adoptive parents decide to renegotiate their adoption assistance agreement under Northstar
Care for Children must be assessed according to section 256O.240 and then transitioned into
Northstar Care for Children according to the process in section 256O.270. Effective November 25,

    Subd. 3. Child care component of the assessment. (a) The assessment tool established
under subdivision 2 must include consideration of the caregiver's need for child care according
to this subdivision. Prior to including consideration of the caregiver's need for child care on the
child's assessment, prospective adoptive parents or relative custodians shall apply to the child
care assistance program under chapter 119B. Foster parents are not required to apply to the child
care assistance program to have the caregiver's need for child care considered as part of the foster
child's assessment.

caregivers who are wait-listed for child care assistance or are eligible for child care assistance but
choose not to receive it.
    (c) The level determined by the balance of the assessment must be adjusted based on the number
of hours of child care needed each week due to employment or attending a training or educational
program as follows:
   (1) less than ten hours or if the caregiver is participating in the child care assistance program
under chapter 119B, no adjustment;
   (2) ten to 19 hours, increase one level;
   (3) 20 to 29 hours, increase two levels;
   (4) 30 to 39 hours, increase three levels; and

Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b,
within 30 days of the child's placement in foster care. Reassessments must be completed by the
legally responsible agency according to subdivision 7. If the foster parent is unable or unwilling
to cooperate with the assessment process, the child must be assessed at the basic level, level B
under section 256O.250, subdivision 3. Notice to the foster parent must be provided as specified in
subdivision 9.
    (c) For children eligible for guardianship assistance under section 256O.220, a new assessment
is required as part of the negotiation of the guardianship assistance agreement if:
   (1) the child is determined to be an at-risk child;
    (2) the child was not placed in foster care with the proposed relative custodian immediately prior
to the negotiation of the guardianship assistance agreement under subdivision 10; or

which case, the child must be assessed at level A under section 256O.250, subdivision 1. Notice to
the proposed relative custodian must be provided as specified in subdivision 9.
   (d) For children eligible for adoption assistance under section 256O.230, a new assessment is

   (1) the child is determined to be an at-risk child;
    (2) the child was not placed in foster care with the prospective adoptive parent immediately prior
to the negotiation of the adoption assistance agreement under subdivision 10; or

256.01, subdivision 14b. If there is no county of financial responsibility and the child is not in the
American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, or the financially responsible agency is not a county
social service or tribal agency in the state, the assessment must be completed by the agency
designated by the commissioner. If reassessment is required after the effective date of the adoption
assistance agreement, it must be completed by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee.
If the prospective adoptive parent is unable or unwilling to cooperate with the assessment process,
the child must be assessed at the basic level, level B under section 256O.250, subdivision 3, unless

section 256O.250, subdivision 1. Notice to the prospective adoptive parent must be provided as
specified in subdivision 9.

initiate a reassessment request in writing to the county of financial responsibility, or, for children in
the American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized

designee for adoption assistance and guardianship assistance cases. The written request must include
the reason for the request and the name, address, and contact information of the caregivers. For
an eligible child with a guardianship assistance or adoption assistance agreement, the caregiver
may request a reassessment if at least six months have elapsed since any previously requested
review. A caregiver for a foster child may request reassessment in less than six months with written
documentation that there have been significant changes in the child's needs that necessitate an earlier
reassessment.
    (b) A caregiver may request a reassessment of an at-risk child for whom a guardianship
assistance or adoption assistance agreement has been executed if the caregiver has written

was based has manifested itself.
    (c) If the reassessment cannot be completed within 30 days of the caregiver's request, the agency
responsible for reassessment shall notify the caregiver of the reason for the delay and a reasonable

responsible agency or state.
    Subd. 10. Agreements. (a) In order to receive guardianship assistance or adoption assistance
benefits, a written, binding agreement on a form approved by the commissioner must be established
prior to finalization of the adoption or a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody. The
agreement must be negotiated with the caregivers according to subdivision 11. The caregivers and
the commissioner or the commissioner's designee must sign the agreement. A copy of the signed
agreement must be given to each party. Termination or disruption of the preadoptive placement or
the foster care placement preceding assignment of custody makes the agreement with that family
void.

permanent legal and physical custody of the child, to the extent that the total cost does not exceed
$2,000 per child;
    (6) that the agreement must remain in effect regardless of the state of which the adoptive parents
or relative custodians are residents at any given time;
   (7) provisions for modification of the terms of the agreement; and
   (8) the effective date of the agreement.
    (c) The effective date of the guardianship assistance agreement is the date of the court order that
transfers permanent legal and physical custody to the relative.
    (d)(1) For a child who receives Supplementary Security Income (SSI), Retirement, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (RSDI), veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits, or black lung
benefits, the effective date of the adoption assistance agreement is the date that the adoption is
finalized.
    (2) For a child who does not receive SSI, RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits,
or black lung benefits, and who has been in the prospective adoptive parents' home as a foster child
for at least six consecutive months prior to adoption placement, the effective date of the agreement
is the date of adoptive placement or the date that the agreement is signed by all parties, whichever
is later.
    (3) For a child who does not receive SSI, RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits,
or black lung benefits, and who has been in the prospective adoptive parents' home as a foster child

    Subd. 11. Negotiation of the agreement. (a) A monthly payment is provided as part of the
adoption assistance or guardianship assistance agreement to support the care of children who
have manifested special needs. The amount of the payment made on behalf of children eligible
for guardianship assistance or adoption assistance is determined through agreement between the
relative custodian or the adoptive parent and the commissioner or the commissioner's designee,
using the assessment tool established by the commissioner in subdivision 2 and the associated
benefit and payments in section 256O.250. The assessment tool establishes the monthly benefit
level for a child in foster care. The monthly payment under a guardianship assistance agreement
or adoption assistance agreement may be negotiated up to the monthly benefit level under foster
care. In no case may the amount of the payment under a guardianship assistance agreement or
adoption assistance agreement exceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been
paid during the month if the child with respect to whom the guardianship assistance or adoption
assistance payment is made had been in a foster family home in the state. The income of the relative
custodian or adoptive parent must not be taken into consideration when determining eligibility
for guardianship assistance or adoption assistance or the amount of the payments under section
256O.250. With the concurrence of the relative custodian or adoptive parent, the amount of the
payment may be adjusted periodically using the assessment tool established by the commissioner
3228                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [42ND DAY

in subdivision 2 and the agreement renegotiated under subdivision 12 when there is a change in
the child's needs or the family's circumstances.
    (b) The guardianship assistance or adoption assistance agreement of a child who is identified
as an at-risk child must not include a monthly payment unless and until the potential disability
manifests itself, as documented by an appropriate professional, and the commissioner authorizes
commencement of payment by modifying the agreement accordingly. A relative custodian or
adoptive parent of an at-risk child with a guardianship assistance or adoption assistance agreement
may request a reassessment of the child under subdivision 8 and renegotiation of the guardianship
assistance or adoption assistance agreement under subdivision 12 to include a monthly payment,
if the caregiver has written professional documentation that the potential disability upon which
eligibility for the agreement was based has manifested itself. Documentation of the disability must
be limited to evidence deemed appropriate by the commissioner.
    (c)(1) The initial amount of the monthly guardianship assistance payment must be equivalent
to the foster care rate in effect at the time that the agreement is signed less any offsets in section
256O.250, subdivision 8, or a lesser negotiated amount if agreed to by the prospective relative
custodian and specified in that agreement, unless the child is identified as an at-risk child.
    (2) An at-risk child must be assigned level A according to section 256O.250 and there shall be no
monthly guardianship assistance payment unless and until the potential disability manifests itself,
as documented by an appropriate professional, and the commissioner authorizes commencement of
payment by modifying the agreement accordingly.
    (d)(1) For a child in foster care with the prospective adoptive parent immediately prior to
adoptive placement, the initial amount of the monthly adoption assistance payment must be
equivalent to the foster care rate in effect at the time that the agreement is signed less any offsets
in section 256O.250, subdivision 8, or a lesser negotiated amount if agreed to by the prospective
adoptive parents and specified in that agreement, unless the child is identified as an at-risk child.
    (2) An at-risk child must be assigned level A according to section 256O.250 and there must be
no monthly adoption assistance payment unless and until the potential disability manifests itself,
as documented by an appropriate professional, and the commissioner authorizes commencement of
payment by modifying the agreement accordingly.
    (3) For children who are in the guardianship assistance program immediately prior to adoptive
placement, the initial amount of the adoption assistance payment must be equivalent to the
guardianship assistance payment in effect at the time that the adoption assistance agreement is
signed or a lesser amount if agreed to by the prospective adoptive parent and specified in that
agreement.
    (4) For children who are not in foster care placement or the guardianship assistance program
immediately prior to adoptive placement or negotiation of the adoption assistance agreement, the
initial amount of the adoption assistance agreement must be determined using the assessment tool
and process in this section and the corresponding payment amount in section 256O.250.
    Subd. 12. Renegotiation of the agreement. (a) A relative custodian or adoptive parent of a child
with a guardianship assistance or adoption assistance agreement may request renegotiation of the
agreement when there is a change in the needs of the child or in the family's circumstances. When
a relative custodian or adoptive parent requests renegotiation of the agreement, a reassessment of
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                       3229

the child must be completed. If the reassessment indicates that the child's level has changed, the
commissioner or the commissioner's designee and the caregiver shall renegotiate the agreement to
include a payment with the level determined through the reassessment process. The agreement must
not be renegotiated unless the commissioner and the caregiver mutually agree to the changes. The
effective date of any renegotiated agreement must be determined by the commissioner.
    (b) A relative custodian or adoptive parent of an at-risk child with a guardianship assistance or
adoption assistance agreement may request renegotiation of the agreement to include a monthly
payment, if the caregiver has written professional documentation that the potential disability upon
which eligibility for the agreement was based has manifested itself. Documentation of the disability
must be limited to evidence deemed appropriate by the commissioner. Prior to renegotiating
the agreement, a reassessment of the child must be conducted according to subdivision 8. The
reassessment must be used to renegotiate the agreement to include an appropriate monthly payment.
The agreement shall not be renegotiated unless the commissioner and the caregiver mutually
agree to the changes. The effective date of any renegotiated agreement shall be determined by the
commissioner.
    Subd. 13. Transition assessments. (a) For a child who might transition into Northstar Care for
Children under section 256O.210 subdivision 5; 256O.220, subdivision 8; or 256O.230, subdivision
14, initial transition assessments must be completed between May 1, 2010, and December 31, 2010.
    (b) Transition assessments for a child in foster care completed between May 1, 2010, and August

7 until July 1, 2011.
    (c) Children with relative custody assistance agreements under section 257.85 that are effective
prior to May 1, 2010, shall have initial transition assessments completed between May 1 and
December 31, 2010. Children with relative custody assistance agreements between May 1, 2010,
and November 24, 2010, shall have an initial transition assessment completed as the agreement is
being established in conjunction with the supplemental maintenance needs assessment and other
required relative custody assistance paperwork under section 257.85.
    (d) Children with adoption assistance agreements negotiated under section 259.67 and submitted

Northstar Care for Children, shall have initial transition assessments completed by August 31, 2010.
Children with adoption assistance agreements negotiated under section 259.67 and submitted to the
commissioner for review and approval between May 1, 2010, and November 24, 2010, shall have
an initial transition assessment completed in conjunction with the supplemental maintenance needs
assessment and other required adoption assistance paperwork under section 259.67.
    (e) If the child's caregiver is unable or unwilling to cooperate with the initial transition
assessment process, the child shall be assessed at the basic level, level B under section 256O.250,
subdivision 3, unless the child is known to be an at-risk child, in which case the child shall
be assessed at level A under section 256O.250, subdivision 1. Within 60 days of the caregiver
indicating they are able or willing to cooperate with the assessment process, the commissioner or
the commissioner's designee shall complete a reassessment for the child.
   (f) If the child's caregiver cannot be located to complete the initial transition assessment process
according to the time frames outlined in this section, the child shall be assessed at the basic level,
3230                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [42ND DAY

level B under section 256O.250, subdivision 3, unless the child is known to be an at-risk child, in
which case the child shall be assessed at level A under section 256O.250, subdivision 1. Within 60
days of locating the caregiver, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall complete a
reassessment for the child.
   Sec. 13. [256O.250] BENEFITS AND PAYMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Benefits. There are three potential benefits available under Northstar Care for
Children: medical assistance, basic payment, and supplemental difficulty of care payment. An
eligible child receives medical assistance under subdivision 2. An eligible child receives the basic
payment under subdivision 3, except for those assigned level A because they are determined to be
at-risk children in guardianship assistance or adoption assistance. An eligible child may receive
an additional supplemental difficulty of care payment under subdivision 4, as determined by the
assessment under section 256O.240.
   Subd. 2. Medical assistance. Eligibility for medical assistance under this chapter continues to
be determined according to section 256B.055.

                        level B                               none
                        level C                               $60 per month
                        level D                               $120 per month

                        level G                               $300 per month
                        level H                               $360 per month
                        level I                               $420 per month
                        level J                               $480 per month
                        level K                               $540 per month
                        level L                               $600 per month.

   A child assigned level B is still eligible for basic monthly rate under subdivision 3.
    Subd. 5. Daily rates. The commissioner shall establish prorated daily rates to the nearest cent
for the monthly rates under subdivisions 3 and 4. Daily rates must be routinely used when a partial
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                       3231

month is involved for foster care, guardianship assistance, and adoption assistance.
    Subd. 6. Revision. By April 1, 2013, for fiscal year 2013, and by each subsequent April 1 for
each subsequent fiscal year, the commissioner shall review and revise the rates under subdivisions
3, 4, and 5 based on United States Department of Agriculture Estimates of the Cost of Raising a
Child, published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Resources Service,
Publication 1411. The revision must be the average percentage by which costs increase for the age
ranges represented in the United States Department of Agriculture Estimates of the Cost of Raising
a Child. The monthly rates must be revised to the nearest dollar and the daily rates to the nearest
cent.
    Subd. 7. Home and vehicle modifications. A child who is eligible for an adoption assistance
agreement based on the child's physical disability or a child who is eligible for a guardianship
assistance agreement who possesses a physical disability must have reimbursement of home
and vehicle modifications necessary to accommodate the child's physical disability included as
part of the negotiation of the agreement under section 256O.240, subdivision 11. The total of all
modifications must not exceed $25,000 and the modifications must be requested during the first
six months that the adoption assistance or guardianship assistance agreement is in effect. The type
and cost of each modification must be preapproved by the commissioner. The type of home and
vehicle modifications is limited to those specified by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
ensure that the modifications are necessary to incorporate the child into the family and that the cost
is reasonable. Application for and reimbursement of modifications must be completed according to
a process specified by the commissioner.
    Subd. 8. Child income or income attributable to the child. (a) A monthly adoption assistance
or guardianship assistance payment must be considered income and resource attributable to the child
and must be inalienable by any assignment or transfer and exempt from garnishment under the laws
of the state.
   (b) When a child is placed into foster care, any income and resources attributable to the child
must be handled according to sections 252.27 and 260C.331 or 260B.331, if applicable to the child
being placed.
    (c) Consideration of income and resources attributable to the child must be part of the negotiation
process in section 256O.240, subdivision 11. In some circumstances, the receipt of other income on
behalf of the child may impact the amount of the monthly payment received by the adoptive parent or
relative custodian on behalf of the child through Northstar Care for Children. Supplemental Security
Income (SSI), Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI), veteran's benefits, railroad
retirement benefits, and black lung benefits are considered income and resources attributable to the
child.
    Subd. 9. Treatment of Supplemental Security Income. If a child placed in foster care receives
benefits through Supplemental Security Income (SSI) at the time of foster care placement or
subsequent to placement in foster care, the county of financial responsibility, or, for children in the
American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized
in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, may apply to be the payee for the child for the duration of the
child's placement in foster care. If a child continues to be eligible for SSI after finalization of the
adoption or transfer of permanent legal and physical custody and is determined to be eligible for a
payment under Northstar Care for Children, a permanent caregiver may choose to receive payment
3232                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [42ND DAY

from both programs simultaneously. If the payment under Northstar Care for Children is a title
IV-E payment, the permanent caregiver is responsible to report the amount of the payment to the
Social Security Administration and the SSI payment will be reduced by the amount of the payment
under Northstar Care for Children, as required by the Social Security Administration.
    Subd. 10. Treatment of RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits, and black
lung benefits. (a) If a child placed in foster care receives RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad
retirement benefits, or black lung benefits at the time of foster care placement or subsequent to
placement in foster care, the county of financial responsibility, or, for children in the American
Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized in section
256.01, subdivision 14b, may apply to be the payee for the child for the duration of the child's
placement in foster care. If it is anticipated that a child will be eligible to receive RSDI, veteran's
benefits, railroad retirement benefits, or black lung benefits after finalization of the adoption or
assignment of permanent legal and physical custody, the permanent caregiver shall apply to be
the payee of those benefits on the child's behalf. The monthly amount of the other benefits must
be considered an offset to the amount of the payment the child is determined eligible for under
Northstar Care for Children.
    (b) If a child becomes eligible for RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits, or black
lung benefits after the initial amount of the payment under Northstar Care for Children is finalized,
the permanent caregiver shall contact the commissioner to renegotiate the payment under Northstar
Care for Children. The monthly amount of the other benefits must be considered an offset to the
amount of the payment the child is determined eligible for under Northstar Care for Children.
    (c) If a child ceases to be eligible for RSDI, veteran's benefits, railroad retirement benefits, or
black lung benefits after the initial amount of the payment under Northstar Care for Children is
finalized, the permanent caregiver shall contact the commissioner to renegotiate the payment under
Northstar Care for Children. The monthly amount of the payment under Northstar Care for Children
must be the amount the child was determined to be eligible for prior to consideration of any offset.
    (d) If the monthly payment received on behalf of the child under RSDI, veteran's benefits,
railroad retirement benefits, or black lung benefits changes after the adoption assistance
or guardianship assistance agreement is finalized, the permanent caregiver shall notify the
commissioner as to the new monthly payment amount, regardless of the amount of the change in
payment. If the monthly payment changes by $75 or more, even if the change occurs incrementally
over the duration of the term of the adoption assistance or guardianship assistance agreement, the
monthly payment under Northstar Care for Children must be renegotiated to reflect the amount
of the increase or decrease in the offset amount. Any subsequent change to the payment must be
reported and handled in the same manner. A change of monthly payments of less than $75 is not
a permissible reason to renegotiate the adoption assistance or guardianship assistance agreement
under section 256O.240, subdivision 12.
     Subd. 11. Treatment of child support and MFIP. (a) If a child placed in foster care receives
child support, the child support payment may be redirected to the county of financial responsibility,
or, for children in the American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service
agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, for the duration of the child's placement in
foster care. In cases where the child qualifies for Northstar Care for Children by meeting the adoption
assistance eligibility criteria or the guardianship assistance eligibility criteria, any court-ordered
child support must not be considered income attributable to the child and must have no impact on
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                       3233

the monthly payment.
   (b) Consistent with section 256J.24, children eligible for and receiving a payment from Northstar
Care for Children are excluded from a MFIP assistance unit.
  Subd. 12. Payments. (a) Payments to caregivers under Northstar Care for Children must be
made monthly.
    (b) The county of financial responsibility, or, for children in the American Indian Child Welfare
Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b,
shall pay foster parents for eligible children in foster care.
    (c) The commissioner shall pay caregivers for eligible children in guardianship assistance
and adoption assistance. Payments must commence when the commissioner receives the required
documentation from the court, the legally responsible agency, or the caregiver. In guardianship
assistance or adoption assistance cases, monthly payments must be prorated according to
subdivision 5 based on the effective date of the agreement.
    Subd. 13. Effect of benefit on other aid. Payments received under this section shall not be
considered as income for child care assistance under chapter 119B or any other financial benefit.
Consistent with section 256J.24, all children receiving a maintenance payment under Northstar Care
for Children are excluded from any MFIP assistance unit.
    Subd. 14. Waivered service plans. A child in foster care may qualify for home and
community-based waivered services, consistent with section 256B.092 for developmental
disabilities, or section 256B.49 for community alternative care, community alternatives for disabled
individuals, or traumatic brain injury waivers. A waiver service must not be substituted for the
foster care program. When the child is eligible for waivered services and eligible for this benefit,
the local social service agency must assess and provide basic and supplemental difficulty of care
rates as determined by the universal assessment under section 256O.240. If it is determined that
additional services are needed to meet the child's needs in the home that is not or cannot be met by
the foster care program, the need would be referred to the waivered service program.
     Subd. 15. Overpayments. The commissioner has the authority to collect any amount of foster
care, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance paid to a caregiver in excess of the payment
due. Payments covered by this subdivision include basic maintenance needs payments, supplemental
difficulty of care payments, and reimbursement of home and vehicle modifications under subdivision
7. Prior to any collection, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall notify the caregiver
in writing, including:
   (1) the amount of the overpayment and an explanation of the cause of overpayment;
   (2) clarification of the corrected amount;
   (3) a statement of the legal authority for the decision;
   (4) information about how the caregiver can correct the overpayment;
   (5) if repayment is required, when the payment is due and a person to contact to review a
repayment plan;
   (6) a statement that the caregiver is entitled to a fair hearing review by the department; and
3234                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [42ND DAY

   (7) the procedure for seeking the review in clause (6).
    Subd. 16. Payee. For adoption assistance and guardianship assistance cases, the payment may
only be made to the adoptive parent or relative custodian specified on the agreement. If there is
more than one adoptive parent or relative custodian, both parties must be listed as the payee unless
otherwise specified in writing according to policies outlined by the commissioner. In the event of
divorce or separation of the caregivers, a change of payee may be made in writing according to
policies outlined by the commissioner. If both caregivers are in agreement as to the change, it may
be made according to a process outlined by the commissioner. If there is not agreement as to the
change, a court order indicating the party who is to receive the payment is needed before a change
can be processed. If the change of payee is disputed, the commissioner may withhold the payment
until agreement is reached. A noncustodial caregiver may request notice in writing of review,
modification, or termination of the adoption assistance or guardianship assistance agreement. In the
event of the death of a payee, a change of payee consistent with sections 256O.220 and 256O.230
may be made in writing according to policies outlined by the commissioner.
    Subd. 17. Notification of change. (a) Parents or relative custodians who have an adoption
assistance agreement or guardianship assistance agreement in place shall keep the agency
administering the program informed of the parent's or custodian's address and circumstances which
would make them ineligible for the payments or eligible for the payments in a different amount.
    (b) For the duration of the agreement, the adoptive parent or relative custodian agrees to notify
the agency administering the program in writing within 30 days of the following changes:
   (1) change in the family's address;
   (2) change in the legal custody status of the child;
   (3) child's completion of high school, if this occurs after the child attains age 18;
   (4) date of termination of the parental rights of the adoptive parent, transfer of permanent legal
and physical custody to another person, or other determination that the adoptive parent or relative
custodian is no longer legally responsible for support of the child;
   (5) date the adoptive parent or relative custodian is no longer providing support to the child;
   (6) date of death of the child;
   (7) date of death of the adoptive parent or relative custodian;
   (8) date the child enlists in the military;
   (9) date of marriage of the child;
   (10) date the child becomes an emancipated minor through legal action of another state;
   (11) separation or divorce of the adoptive parent or relative custodian;
    (12) change of the caregiver's employment or educational enrollment status, if the child has not
attained age 13 and the child care component of the assessment under section 256O.240, subdivision
2, was used to determine the assessment level; and
   (13) residence of the child outside the home for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                      3235

    Subd. 18. Termination notice for caregiver. The responsible agency must provide a child's
caregiver written notice of termination of payment. Termination notices must be sent at least 15
days before the final payment or in the case of an unplanned termination, the notice is sent within
three days of the end of the payment. The written notice must minimally include the following:
   (1) the date payment will end;
   (2) the reason payments will end and the event that is the basis to terminate payment;
   (3) a statement that the provider is entitled to a fair hearing review by the department consistent
with section 256.045, subdivision 3;
   (4) the procedure to request a fair hearing; and
    (5) name, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic contact address of a contact person
at the county or state.
   Sec. 14. [256O.260] FEDERAL SHARE, STATE SHARE, LOCAL SHARE.
    Subdivision 1. Federal share. For the purposes of determining a child's eligibility under title
IV-E of the Social Security Act for a child in foster care, the county of financial responsibility or,
for children in the American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service
agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, shall use the eligibility requirements outlined
in section 472 of the Social Security Act. For a child who qualifies for guardianship assistance or
adoption assistance, the county of financial responsibility or, for children in the American Indian
Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized in section 256.01,
subdivision 14b, shall use the eligibility requirements outlined in section 473 of the Social Security
Act. In each case, the agency paying the maintenance payments must be reimbursed for the costs
from the federal money available for this purpose.
    Subd. 2. State share. The commissioner shall pay the state share of the maintenance payments as
determined under subdivision 4, and an identical share of the pre-Northstar Care adoption assistance
program under section 259.67. The commissioner may transfer funds into the account if a deficit
occurs.
    Subd. 3. Local share. The county of financial responsibility under section 256G.02 or tribal
social service agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, at the time of placement for
foster care or finalization of the agreement for guardianship assistance or adoption assistance, shall
pay the local share of the maintenance payments as determined under subdivision 4, and an identical
share of the pre-Northstar Care adoption assistance program under section 259.67. The county of
financial responsibility under section 256G.02 or tribal social service agency authorized in section
256.01, subdivision 14b, shall pay the entire cost of any initial clothing allowance, child-placing
agency administrative payments, or other support services it authorizes, except as provided under
other provisions of law. In cases of federally required adoption assistance where there is no county
of financial responsibility, or, for children in the American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the
responsible tribal social service agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, as provided
in section 256O.240, subdivision 5, the commissioner shall pay the local share.
   Subd. 4. Nonfederal share. The commissioner shall establish a percentage share of the
maintenance payments, reduced by federal reimbursements under title IV-E of the Social Security
Act, to be paid by the state and to be paid by the county of financial responsibility under section
3236                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [42ND DAY

256G.02 or tribal social service agency authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b. These
state and local shares shall initially be calculated based on the ratio of the average appropriate
expenditures made by the state and all counties and tribal social service agencies authorized in
section 256.01, subdivision 14b, during state fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010. For purposes
of this calculation, appropriate expenditures for the counties and tribal social service agencies
shall include basic and difficulty of care payments for foster care, not including any initial
clothing allowance, child-placing agency administrative payments, child care, or other ancillary
expenditures, reduced by federal reimbursements. For purposes of this calculation, appropriate
expenditures for the state must include adoption assistance and relative custody assistance, reduced
by federal reimbursements. For each of the periods January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012, and fiscal
years 2013 and 2014, the commissioner shall adjust this initial percentage of state and local shares
to reflect the relative expenditure trends during state fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The fiscal
year 2014 set of percentages must be used for all subsequent years.
     Subd. 5. Adjustments for proportionate shares among legally responsible agencies. For
children who transition into Northstar Care for Children under section 256O.270, subdivision 7,
and for children on the pre-Northstar Care adoption assistance program under section 259.67, the
commissioner shall adjust the expenditures by each county or tribal social service agency so that
its relative share is proportional to its foster care expenditures as determined under subdivision 4
for state fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 compared with similar costs of all county or tribal social
service agencies.
   Sec. 15. [256O.270] ADMINISTRATION.
    Subdivision 1. Responsibilities. (a) The county of financial responsibility or, for children in the
American Indian Child Welfare Initiative, the responsible tribal social service agency authorized
in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, shall determine the eligibility for Northstar Care for Children
for children in foster care under section 256O.210, and for those children determined eligible, shall
further determine each child's eligibility for title IV-E of the Social Security Act.
    (b) Subject to commissioner approval, the legally responsible agency shall determine the
eligibility for Northstar Care for Children for children in guardianship assistance under section
256O.220 and children in adoption assistance under section 256O.230, and for those children
determined eligible, shall further determine each child's eligibility for title IV-E of the Social
Security Act.
   (c) The legally responsible agency is responsible for the administration of Northstar Care for
Children for children in foster care, and for assisting the commissioner with the administration
of Northstar Care for Children for children in guardianship assistance and adoption assistance
by conducting assessments, reassessments, negotiations, and other activities as specified by the
commissioner under subdivision 2.

    Subd. 3. Administration of title IV-E programs. The title IV-E foster care, guardianship
assistance, and adoption assistance programs shall operate within the statutes and rules set forth by
the federal government in the Social Security Act and Code of Federal Regulations.
    Subd. 4. Reporting. The commissioner shall specify required fiscal and statistical reports under
section 256.01, subdivision 2, paragraph (q), and other reports as necessary.
    Subd. 5. Promotion of programs. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall
actively seek ways to promote the guardianship assistance and adoption assistance programs,
including informing prospective relative custodians of eligible children of the availability
of guardianship assistance and prospective adoptive parents of eligible children under the
commissioner's guardianship of the availability of adoption assistance. All families who adopt
children under the commissioner's guardianship must be informed as to the adoption tax credit.
   Subd. 6. Appeals and fair hearings. (a) A caregiver has the right to appeal to the commissioner
pursuant to section 256.045 when eligibility for Northstar Care for Children is denied, and when
payment or the agreement for eligible child is modified or terminated.
    (b) A relative custodian or adoptive parent has additional rights to appeal to the commissioner
under section 256.045. The rights include when the commissioner terminates or modifies the
guardianship assistance or adoption assistance agreement or when the commissioner denies an
application for guardianship assistance or adoption assistance. A prospective relative custodian or
adoptive parent who disagrees with a decision by the commissioner prior to transfer of permanent
legal and physical custody or finalization of the adoption may request review of the decision by
the commissioner or may appeal the decision under section 256.045. A guardianship assistance
or adoption assistance agreement must be signed and in effect prior to the court order that
transfers permanent legal and physical custody or the adoption finalization, however in some
cases, there may be extenuating circumstances as to why an agreement was not entered into
prior to the finalization of permanency for the child. Caregivers who believe that extenuating
circumstances exist in the case of the caregiver's child may request a fair hearing. Caregivers
have the responsibility of proving that extenuating circumstances exist. Caregivers are required
to provide written documentation of each eligibility criterion at the fair hearing. Examples of
extenuating circumstances include: relevant facts regarding the child were known by the placing
agency and not presented to the caregiver prior to transfer of permanent legal and physical custody
or finalization of the adoption, failure by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee to
advise potential caregivers about the availability of guardianship assistance or adoption assistance
for children in the state foster care system. If an appeals judge finds through the fair hearing process
that extenuating circumstances existed and that the child met all eligibility criteria at the time the
transfer of permanent legal and physical custody was ordered or the adoption was finalized, the
effective date and any associated federal financial participation must be retroactive to the date of
the request for a fair hearing.
    Subd. 7. Transition; timelines; assessments. (a) All eligible children shall participate in an
initial assessment under section 256O.240, subdivision 3.
    (b) All children in foster care, relative custody assistance, or adoption assistance are eligible
for Northstar Care for Children as specified in sections 256O.210, 256O.220, and 256O.230. All
children in foster care or receiving relative custody assistance under section 257.85 on December

good cause to warrant extension of this consideration period. If adoptive parents decide to opt
in to Northstar Care for Children, the adoptive parents' adoption assistance agreement must be
renegotiated according to section 256O.240, subdivision 10. If an adoptive parent would like to opt

the expectation that the juvenile court will take a certain action, the relative custody assistance
agreement does not become effective until and unless the court acts as expected.
   (b) After November 24, 2010, no new relative custody assistance agreements shall be executed.
Agreements that were signed on or before November 24, 2010, and were not in effect because the

under this section if all of the requirements in paragraphs (b) to (g) are met.
    (b) There has been a determination that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home

       (1) a court-ordered termination of parental rights;
       (2) a petition to terminate parental rights;

       (6) the death of the legal parent.
    (c) There exists a specific factor or condition because of which it is reasonable to conclude that
the child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance as evidenced

paragraph (d), clause (1), item (i), the placing agency minimally must:
    (1) give consideration, as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 5, to placement with a
relative;
    (2) for an Indian child covered by the Indian Child Welfare Act, comply with the placement
preferences identified in the Indian Child Welfare Act and the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation
Act; and
   (3) review all families approved for adoption who are associated with the placing agency.
    If the review of families associated with the placing agency results in the identification of an
appropriate adoptive placement for the child, the placing agency must provide documentation of
the placement decision to the commissioner as part of the application for adoption assistance.
    If two or more appropriate families are not approved or available within the placing agency,
the agency shall locate additional prospective adoptive families by registering the child with
the State Adoption Exchange, as required under section 259.75. If registration with the State
Adoption Exchange does not result in an appropriate family for the child, the agency shall employ
other recruitment methods, as outlined in recruitment policies and procedures prescribed by the
commissioner, to meet this requirement.
    (f) The requirement for a documented search for an appropriate adoptive placement under
paragraph (d), including review of all families approved for adoption that are associated with
the placing agency, registration of the child with the State Adoption Exchange, and additional
recruitment methods, must be waived if:

  (2) the child is being adopted by foster parents with whom the child has developed significant
emotional ties while in their care as a foster child;
    (3) the child is being adopted by a family that previously adopted a child of the same mother or
father; or
   (4) the court determines that adoption by the identified family is in the child's best interest.
   For an Indian child covered by the Indian Child Welfare Act, a waiver must not be granted
unless the placing agency has complied with the placement preferences identified in the Indian Child
Welfare Act and the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act.
     (g) Once the placing agency has determined that placement with an identified family is in the
child's best interest and made full written disclosure about the child's social and medical history,
the agency must ask the prospective adoptive parents if they are willing to adopt the child without
adoption assistance. If the identified family is either unwilling or unable to adopt the child without
adoption assistance, they must provide a written statement to this effect to the placing agency to
fulfill the requirement to make a reasonable effort to place the child without adoption assistance,
and a copy of this statement shall be included in the adoption assistance application. If the identified
family desires to adopt the child without adoption assistance, the family must provide a written
statement to this effect to the placing agency and the statement must be maintained in the permanent

on each prospective adoptive parent. If the background study reveals:
   (1) a felony conviction at any time for child abuse or neglect;
   (2) spousal abuse;
   (3) a crime against children, including child pornography;
   (4) a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including
other physical assault or battery; or
    (5) a felony conviction within the past five years for physical assault, battery, or a drug-related

the adoptive parent is prohibited from receiving title IV-E adoption assistance on behalf of an
otherwise eligible child.
   (b) A prospective adoptive parent who possesses one of the felony convictions in paragraph (a)
may receive state-funded adoption assistance on behalf of an otherwise eligible child if the court
has made a judicial determination that:
   (1) the legally responsible agency has thoroughly reviewed the felony conviction and has

permanency;

the child's level has changed, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee and the parent shall
renegotiate the agreement to include a payment with the level determined appropriate through the
reassessment process. The agreement must not be renegotiated unless the commissioner and the
parent mutually agree to the changes. The effective date of any renegotiated agreement must be

    Subd. 41. Promotion of programs. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall
actively seek ways to promote the adoption assistance program, including informing prospective
adoptive parents of eligible children under the commissioner's guardianship of the availability of
adoption assistance. All families who adopt children under the commissioner's guardianship must
be informed as to the adoption tax credit.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 259.67, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 42. Appeals and fair hearings. (a) A prospective adoptive parent has the right to appeal
to the commissioner under section 256.045 when eligibility for adoption assistance is denied, and
when payment or the agreement for an eligible child is modified or terminated.
    (b) An adoptive parent has additional rights to appeal to the commissioner under section
256.045. These include when the commissioner terminates or modifies the adoption assistance
agreement or when the commissioner denies an application for adoption assistance. A prospective
adoptive parent who disagrees with a decision by the commissioner prior to finalization of the
adoption may request review of the decision by the commissioner, or may appeal the decision under
section 256.045. An adoption assistance agrement must be signed and in effect prior to the court
order that finalizes the adoption; however, in some cases, there may be extenuating circumstances
as to why an agreement was not entered into prior to the adoption finalization. An adoptive
parent who believes that extenuating circumstances exist in the case of an adoption finalizing
prior to entering of an adoption assistance agreement may request a fair hearing. Parents have
the responsibility of proving that extenuating circumstances exist. Parents are required to provide
written documentation of each eligibility criterion at the fair hearing. Examples of extenuating
circumstances include: relevant facts regarding the child were known by the placing agency and not
presented to the parent prior to finalization of the adoption, or failure by the commissioner or the
commissioner's designee to advise a potential parent about the availability of adoption assistance
for a child in the state foster care system. If an appeals judge finds through the fair hearing process
that extenuating circumstances existed and that the child met all eligibility criteria at the time the
adoption was finalized, the effective date and any associated federal financial participation shall be
retroactive to the date of the request for a fair hearing.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 259.67, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 43. No new executions of adoption assistance agreements. After November 24, 2010,
no new adoption assistance agreements must be executed under this section. Agreements that were
signed on or before November 24, 2010, and were not in effect because the adoption finalization
of the child did not occur on or before November 24, 2010, must be renegotiated according to the
terms of Northstar Care for Children under section 256O.001 to 256O.270. Agreements signed and
in effect on or before November 24, 2010, must continue according to the terms of this section and
applicable rules for the duration of the agreement, unless the adoptive parents choose to renegotiate
their agreement in accordance with the terms of Northstar Care for Children. After November 24,
2010, this section and associated rules must apply to a child whose adoption assistance agreements
were in effect on or before November 24, 2010, and whose adoptive parents have chosen not to
renegotiate their agreement according to the terms of Northstar Care for Children.

responsibility for cost and payment for eligible children placed in family foster care settings or in
permanent placement with a relative custodian or adoptive parent. Responsibility for placement
costs and payment in any other setting is with the county, consistent with chapter 256G, or the
tribes authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b.
   Subd. 2. Federal title IV-E. Foster care maintenance payments under title IV-E of the Social
Security Act are defined in subdivisions 4 and 5 and section 256O.020. Every effort must be
made to establish a child's eligibility for title IV-E, using the criteria in the Social Security Act,
United States Code, title 42, sections 670 to 676. Payment of title IV-E funds in Northstar Care for
Children is specified in section 256O.260. In all other circumstances, the county or tribal agency
authorized in section 256.01, subdivision 14b, responsible for payment of the maintenance costs
must be reimbursed from the federal funds available for the purpose.

      Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 18a. Public Assistance Reporting Information System. (a) Effective July 1, 2009, the
commissioner shall comply with the federal requirements in Public Law 110-379 in implementing
the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) to determine eligibility for all
individuals applying for:
      (1) health care benefits under chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L; and
   (2) public benefits under chapters 119B, 256D, 256I, and the supplemental nutrition assistance
program.
   (b) The commissioner shall determine eligibility under paragraph (a) by performing data
matches, including matching with medical assistance, cash, child care, and supplemental assistance
programs operated by other states.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2b. Operating payment rates. In determining operating payment rates for admissions
occurring on or after the rate year beginning January 1, 1991, and every two years after, or more
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                       3267

frequently as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain operating data from
an updated base year and establish operating payment rates per admission for each hospital based on
the cost-finding methods and allowable costs of the Medicare program in effect during the base year.
Rates under the general assistance medical care, medical assistance, and MinnesotaCare programs
shall not be rebased to more current data on January 1, 1997, January 1, 2005, ­   an
                                                                                    ­­d for the first
24 months of the rebased period beginning January 1, 2009, and for the first three months of the
rebased period beginning January 1, 2011. The base year operating payment rate per admission is
standardized by the case mix index and adjusted by the hospital cost index, relative values, and
disproportionate population adjustment. The cost and charge data used to establish operating rates
shall only reflect inpatient services covered by medical assistance and shall not include property
cost information and costs recognized in outlier payments.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.

health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision
16 are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for
purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care.

hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 3.46 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432

managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2009, through
June 30, 2009, to reflect this reduction.

statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities
defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to managed care
plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after July 1, 2010, to reflect this reduction.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.04, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Competitive bidding. (a) When determined to be effective, economical, and feasible,
the commissioner may utilize volume purchase through competitive bidding and negotiation under
the provisions of chapter 16C, to provide items under the medical assistance program including but
not limited to the following:
   (1) eyeglasses;
   (2) oxygen. The commissioner shall provide for oxygen needed in an emergency situation on a

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.056, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Treatment of trusts. (a) A "medical assistance qualifying trust" is a revocable or
irrevocable trust, or similar legal device, established on or before August 10, 1993, by a person
or the person's spouse under the terms of which the person receives or could receive payments
from the trust principal or income and the trustee has discretion in making payments to the person
from the trust principal or income. Notwithstanding that definition, a medical assistance qualifying
3270                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [42ND DAY

trust does not include: (1) a trust set up by will; (2) a trust set up before April 7, 1986, solely to
benefit a person with a developmental disability living in an intermediate care facility for persons
with developmental disabilities; or (3) a trust set up by a person with payments made by the Social
Security Administration pursuant to the United States Supreme Court decision in Sullivan v. Zebley,
110 S. Ct. 885 (1990). The maximum amount of payments that a trustee of a medical assistance
qualifying trust may make to a person under the terms of the trust is considered to be available
assets to the person, without regard to whether the trustee actually makes the maximum payments
to the person and without regard to the purpose for which the medical assistance qualifying trust
was established.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d), trusts established after August 10, 1993, are
treated according to section 13611(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),
Public Law 103-66.
   (c) For purposes of paragraph (d), a pooled trust means a trust established under United States
Code, title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(C).
    (d) A beneficiary's interest in a pooled trust is considered an available asset unless the trust
provides that upon the death of the beneficiary or termination of the trust during the beneficiary's
lifetime, whichever is sooner, the department receives any amount in excess of reasonable

six-month income review or when a change in income or household size is reported. Enrollees
must report any change in income or household size within ten days of when the change occurs. A
decreased premium resulting from a reported change in income or household size shall be effective
the first day of the next available billing month after the change is reported. Except for changes
occurring from annual cost-of-living increases, a change resulting in an increased premium shall
not affect the premium amount until the next six-month review.

required. Premiums may be paid in installments at the discretion of the commissioner.
   (i) Nonpayment of the premium shall result in denial or termination of medical assistance

specified in Minnesota Rules, part 9506.0040, subpart 7, items B to D, are met. Except when an
installment agreement is accepted by the commissioner, all persons disenrolled for nonpayment
of a premium must pay any past due premiums as well as current premiums due prior to being

    Subdivision 1. Income deductions. When an institutionalized person is determined eligible for
medical assistance, the income that exceeds the deductions in paragraphs (a) and (b) must be applied
to the cost of institutional care.
    (a) The following amounts must be deducted from the institutionalized person's income in the
following order:
    (1) the personal needs allowance under section 256B.35 or, for a veteran who does not have
a spouse or child, or a surviving spouse of a veteran having no child, the amount of an improved
pension received from the veteran's administration not exceeding $90 per month;
      (2) the personal allowance for disabled individuals under section 256B.36;
   (3) if the institutionalized person has a legally appointed guardian or conservator, five
percent of the recipient's gross monthly income up to $100 as reimbursement for guardianship or
conservatorship services;
    (4) a monthly income allowance determined under section 256B.058, subdivision 2, but only to
the extent income of the institutionalized spouse is made available to the community spouse;
    (5) a monthly allowance for children under age 18 which, together with the net income of the
children, would provide income equal to the medical assistance standard for families and children
according to section 256B.056, subdivision 4, for a family size that includes only the minor children.
This deduction applies only if the children do not live with the community spouse and only to the
extent that the deduction is not included in the personal needs allowance under section 256B.35,
subdivision 1, as child support garnished under a court order;
   (6) a monthly family allowance for other family members, equal to one-third of the difference
between 122 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and the monthly income for that family
member;
  (7) reparations payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany and reparations payments
made by the Netherlands for victims of Nazi persecution between 1940 and 1945;

or remedial care for the institutionalized person that are not m

community spouse and who is a minor or dependent child, dependent parent, or dependent sibling
of either spouse. "Dependent" means a person who could be claimed as a dependent for federal
income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code.
  (b) Income shall be allocated to an institutionalized person for a period of up to three calendar
months, in an amount equal to the medical assistance standard for a family size of one if:
    (1) a physician certifies that the person is expected to reside in the long-term care facility for
three calendar months or less;
     (2) if the person has expenses of maintaining a residence in the community; and
     (3) if one of the following circumstances apply:
    (i) the person was not living together with a spouse or a family member as defined in paragraph
(a) when the person entered a long-term care facility; or
    (ii) the person and the person's spouse become institutionalized on the same date, in which case
the allocation shall be applied to the income of one of the spouses.
For purposes of this paragraph, a person is determined to be residing in a licensed nursing home,
regional treatment center, or medical institution if the person is expected to remain for a period of
one full calendar month or more.
    Subd. 2. Reasonable expenses. (a) For the purposes of subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (9),

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited transfers. (a) For transfers of assets made on or before August 10,
1993, if an institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse has given away, sold, or
disposed of, for less than fair market value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the
homestead that are excluded under the supplemental security program, within 30 months before or
any time after the date of institutionalization if the person has been determined eligible for medical
assistance, or within 30 months before or any time after the date of the first approved application
for medical assistance if the person has not yet been determined eligible for medical assistance, the
person is ineligible for long-term care services for the period of time determined under subdivision
2.
    (b) Effective for transfers made after August 10, 1993, an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or institutionalized person's spouse, may not give away, sell, or dispose of, for less than fair market
value, any asset or interest therein, except assets other than the homestead that are excluded under
the Supplemental Security Income program, for the purpose of establishing or maintaining medical
assistance eligibility. This applies to all transfers, including those made by a community spouse
after the month in which the institutionalized spouse is determined eligible for medical assistance.
For purposes of determining eligibility for long-term care services, any transfer of such assets
within 36 months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, or 36 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, for less than fair market value may be considered.
Any such transfer is presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing or maintaining
medical assistance eligibility and the institutionalized person is ineligible for long-term care
services for the period of time determined under subdivision 2, unless the institutionalized person
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose,
or unless the transfer is permitted under subdivision 3 or 4. In the case of payments from a trust
or portions of a trust that are considered transfers of assets under federal law, or in the case of
any other disposal of assets made on or after February 8, 2006, any transfers made within 60
months before or any time after an institutionalized person requests medical assistance payment
of long-term care services and within 60 months before or any time after a medical assistance
recipient becomes an institutionalized person, may be considered.
    (c) This section applies to transfers, for less than fair market value, of income or assets, including
assets that are considered income in the month received, such as inheritances, court settlements, and
retroactive benefit payments or income to which the institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse is entitled but does not receive due to action by the institutionalized person, the
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse.
    (d) This section applies to payments for care or personal services provided by a relative, unless
the compensation was stipulated in a notarized, written agreement which was in existence when
the service was performed, the care or services directly benefited the person, and the payments
made represented reasonable compensation for the care or services provided. A notarized written
agreement is not required if payment for the services was made within 60 days after the service was

provided.
    (e) This section applies to the portion of any asset or interest that an institutionalized person, an
institutionalized person's spouse, or any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority
to act in place of, on behalf of, at the direction of, or upon the request of the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse, transfers to any annuity that exceeds the value of the benefit
likely to be returned to the institutionalized person or institutionalized person's spouse while alive,
based on estimated life expectancy as determined according to the current actuarial tables published
by the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. The commissioner may
adopt rules reducing life expectancies based on the need for long-term care. This section applies to
an annuity purchased on or after March 1, 2002, that:
    (1) is not purchased from an insurance company or financial institution that is subject to licensing
or regulation by the Minnesota Department of Commerce or a similar regulatory agency of another
state;
   (2) does not pay out principal and interest in equal monthly installments; or
   (3) does not begin payment at the earliest possible date after annuitization.
    (f) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person who has applied for or is receiving long-term
care services or the institutionalized person's spouse shall be treated as the disposal of an asset
for less than fair market value unless the department is named a preferred remainder beneficiary
as described in section 256B.056, subdivision 11. Any subsequent change to the designation of the
department as a preferred remainder beneficiary shall result in the annuity being treated as a disposal
of assets for less than fair market value. The amount of such transfer shall be the maximum amount
the institutionalized person or the institutionalized person's spouse could receive from the annuity or
similar financial instrument. Any change in the amount of the income or principal being withdrawn
from the annuity or other similar financial instrument at the time of the most recent disclosure shall
be deemed to be a transfer of assets for less than fair market value unless the institutionalized person
or the institutionalized person's spouse demonstrates that the transaction was for fair market value. In
the event a distribution of income or principal has been improperly distributed or disbursed from an
annuity or other retirement planning instrument of an institutionalized person or the institutionalized
person's spouse, a cause of action exists against the individual receiving the improper distribution
for the cost of medical assistance services provided or the amount of the improper distribution,
whichever is less.
    (g) Effective for transactions, including the purchase of an annuity, occurring on or after February
8, 2006, by or on behalf of an institutionalized person applying for or receiving long-term care
services shall be treated as a disposal of assets for less than fair market value unless it is:
   (i) an annuity described in subsection (b) or (q) of section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986; or
   (ii) purchased with proceeds from:
   (A) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
   (B) a simplified employee pension within the meaning of section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue
3278                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [42ND DAY

Code; or
   (C) a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (iii) an annuity that is irrevocable and nonassignable; is actuarially sound as determined in
accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration; and provides for payments in equal amounts during the term of the annuity, with
no deferral and no balloon payments made.
    (h) For purposes of this section, long-term care services include services in a nursing facility,
services that are eligible for payment according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 2, because they
are provided in a swing bed, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
and home and community-based services provided pursuant to sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and
256B.49. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, "institutionalized person"
includes a person who is an inpatient in a nursing facility or in a swing bed, or intermediate care
facility for persons with developmental disabilities or who is receiving home and community-based
services under sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and 256B.49.
    (i) This section applies to funds used to purchase a promissory note, loan, or mortgage unless
the note, loan, or mortgage:
   (1) has a repayment term that is actuarially sound;
   (2) provides for payments to be made in equal amounts during the term of the loan, with no
deferral and no balloon payments made; and
   (3) prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the lender.
    In the case of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage that does not meet an exception in clauses (1)
to (3), the value of such note, loan, or mortgage shall be the outstanding balance due as of the date
of the institutionalized person's request for medical assistance payment of long-term care services.
    (j) This section applies to the purchase of a life estate interest in another person's home unless
the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least one year after the date of purchase.
     (k) This section applies to transfers into a pooled trust that qualifies under United States Code,
title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(C), by:
   (1) a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse; or
    (2) any person, court, or administrative body with legal authority to act in place of, on behalf of,
at the direction of, or upon the request of a person age 65 or older or the person's spouse.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0595, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Period of ineligibility for long-term care services. (a) For any uncompensated transfer
occurring on or before August 10, 1993, the number of months of ineligibility for long-term care
services shall be the lesser of 30 months, or the uncompensated transfer amount divided by the
average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state in effect on the date of
application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance payment rate shall be
adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year. The period of ineligibility
begins with the month in which the assets were transferred. If the transfer was not reported to the
42ND DAY]                            MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009                                          3279

local agency at the time of application, and the applicant received long-term care services during
what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause of action
exists against the transferee for the cost of long-term care services provided during the period of
ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The uncompensated
transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed
of, less the amount of compensation received.
     (b) For uncompensated transfers made after August 10, 1993, the number of months of
ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the total uncompensated value of the resources
transferred divided by the average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state
in effect on the date of application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance
payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year.
The period of ineligibility begins with the first day of the month after the month in which the assets
were transferred except that if one or more uncompensated transfers are made during a period
of ineligibility, the total assets transferred during the ineligibility period shall be combined and
a penalty period calculated to begin on the first day of the month after the month in which the
first uncompensated transfer was made. If the transfer was reported to the local agency after the
date that advance notice of a period of ineligibility that affects the next month could be provided
to the recipient and the recipient received medical assistance services or the transfer was not
reported to the local agency, and the applicant or recipient received medical assistance services
during what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause
of action exists against the transferee for that portion of long-term care services provided during
the period of ineligibility, or for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. The
uncompensated transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away,
sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. Effective for transfers made on
or after March 1, 1996, involving persons who apply for medical assistance on or after April 13,
1996, no cause of action exists for a transfer unless:
    (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was a resident of a long-term care facility or was receiving that level of care in the community at
the time of the transfer;
   (2) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made to assist the
person to qualify for or retain medical assistance eligibility; or
    (3) the transferee actively solicited the transfer with intent to assist the person to qualify for or
retain eligibility for medical assistance.
   (c) For uncompensated transfers made on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility:
    (1) for uncompensated transfers by or on behalf of individuals receiving medical assistance
payment of long-term care services, begins the first day of the month following advance notice of
    p­
the ­ ­­
     en a­t
         l­y­ period of ineligibility, but no later than the first day of the month that follows three full
calendar months from the date of the report or discovery of the transfer; or
    (2) for uncompensated transfers by individuals requesting medical assistance payment of
long-term care services, begins the date on which the individual is eligible for medical assistance
under the Medicaid state plan and would otherwise be receiving long-term care services based on
an approved application for such care but for the ­

                                   l­y­ period of ineligibility results in a partial month, payments for
long-term care services shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fraction.
    (e) In the case of multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than one month for less than
fair market value on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility is calculated by treating
the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred during all months on or after
February 8, 2006, as one transfer.
    (f) A period of ineligibility established under paragraph (c) may be eliminated if all of the assets
transferred for less than fair market value used to calculate the period of ineligibility, or cash equal
to the value of the assets at the time of the transfer, are returned within 12 months after the date
the period of ineligibility begins. A period of ineligibility must not be adjusted if less than the full
amounts of the transferred assets or the full cash values of the transferred assets are returned.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for periods of ineligibility established on or after
July 1, 2009.

   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13e. Payment rates. (a) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the
lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable
cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the
usual and customary price charged to the public. The amount of payment basis must be reduced
to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any provider/insurer agreement or contract
for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater
than the patient liability for the service. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.65, except that
the dispensing fee for intravenous solutions which must be compounded by the pharmacist shall
be $8 per bag, $14 per bag for cancer chemotherapy products, and $30 per bag for total parenteral
nutritional products dispensed in one liter quantities, or $44 per bag for total parenteral nutritional
products dispensed in quantities greater than one liter. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity and
other special discounts except time and cash discounts. Effective July 1, 2008, the actual acquisition
cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus ­        14­ 15
percent. The actual acquisition cost of antihemophilic factor drugs shall be estimated at the average
wholesale price minus 30 percent. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug may be set
by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum amount paid
by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs. Establishment
of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists
for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.
    (c) Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the
actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, or on the maximum allowable cost established by the
3282                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [42ND DAY

commissioner.
    (d) The basis for determining the amount of payment for drugs administered in an outpatient
setting shall be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider or the amount
established for Medicare by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant
to title XVIII, section 1847a of the federal Social Security Act.
    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of
cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology
drugs, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex care. The commissioner shall consult
with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty pharmacy products subject to this
paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in developing this list, the commissioner
shall take into consideration the population served by specialty pharmacy products, the current
delivery system and standard of care in the state, and access to care issues. The commissioner shall
have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate to prevent access to care issues.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from July 1, 2008.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Transportation costs. (a) Medical assistance covers transportation costs incurred
solely for obtaining emergency medical care or transportation costs incurred by eligible persons in
obtaining emergency or nonemergency medical care when paid directly to an ambulance company,
common carrier, or other recognized providers of transportation services.
    (b) Medical assistance covers special transportation, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part
9505.0315, subpart 1, item F, if the recipient has a physical or mental impairment that would
prohibit the recipient from safely accessing and using a bus, taxi, other commercial transportation,
or private automobile.
The commissioner may use an order by the recipient's attending physician to certify that the
recipient requires special transportation services. Special transportation includes driver-assisted
service to eligible individuals. Driver-assisted service includes passenger pickup at and return to
the individual's residence or place of business, assistance with admittance of the individual to the
medical facility, and assistance in passenger securement or in securing of wheelchairs or stretchers
in the vehicle. Special transportation providers must obtain written documentation from the health
care service provider who is serving the recipient being transported, identifying the time that
the recipient arrived. Special transportation providers may not bill for separate base rates for the
continuation of a trip beyond the original destination. Special transportation providers must take
recipients to the nearest appropriate health care provider, using the most direct route available. The
maximum medical assistance reimbursement rates for special transportation services are:

    (3) $60 for the base rate and $2.40 per mile, and an attendant rate of $9 per trip, for services to
eligible persons who need a stretcher-accessible vehicle.
   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Special education services. (a) Medical assistance covers medical services identified
in a recipient's individualized education plan and covered under the medical assistance state
plan. Covered services include occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language therapy,
clinical psychological services, nursing services, school psychological services, school social
work services, personal care assistants serving as management aides, assistive technology devices,
transportation services, health assessments, and other services covered under the medical assistance
state plan. Mental health services eligible for medical assistance reimbursement must be provided
or coordinated through a children's mental health collaborative where a collaborative exists if the
child is included in the collaborative operational target population. The provision or coordination
of services does not require that the individual education plan be developed by the collaborative.
     The services may be provided by a Minnesota school district that is enrolled as a medical
assistance provider or its subcontractor, and only if the services meet all the requirements otherwise
applicable if the service had been provided by a provider other than a school district, in the
following areas: medical necessity, physician's orders, documentation, personnel qualifications,
and prior authorization requirements. The nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this
subdivision is the responsibility of the local school district as provided in section 125A.74. Services
listed in a child's individual education plan are eligible for medical assistance reimbursement only
if those services meet criteria for federal financial participation under the Medicaid program.
   (b) Approval of health-related services for inclusion in the individual education plan does not
require prior authorization for purposes of reimbursement under this chapter. The commissioner
may require physician review and approval of the plan not more than once annually or upon any
modification of the individual education plan that reflects a change in health-related services.
   (c) Services of a speech-language pathologist provided under this section are covered
notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0390, subpart 1, item L, if the person:
   (1) holds a masters degree in speech-language pathology;
   (2) is licensed by the Minnesota Board of Teaching as an educational speech-language
pathologist; and
    (3) either has a certificate of clinical competence from the American Speech and Hearing
Association, has completed the equivalent educational requirements and work experience necessary
for the certificate or has completed the academic program and is acquiring supervised work
experience to qualify for the certificate.
    (d) Medical assistance coverage for medically necessary services provided under other
subdivisions in this section may not be denied solely on the basis that the same or similar services
are covered under this subdivision.

    (e) The commissioner shall develop and implement package rates, bundled rates, or per diem
rates for special education services under which separately covered services are grouped together
and billed as a unit in order to reduce administrative complexity.
    (f) The commissioner shall develop a cost-based payment structure for payment of these services.
The commissioner shall reimburse claims submitted based on an interim rate, and shall settle at a
final rate once the department has determined it. The commissioner shall notify the school district
of the final rate. The school district has 60 days to appeal the final rate. To appeal the final rate, the
school district shall file a written appeal request to the commissioner within 60 days of the date the
final rate determination was mailed. The appeal request shall specify (1) the disputed items and (2)
the name and address of the person to contact regarding the appeal.
    (g) Effective July 1, 2000, medical assistance services provided under an individual education
plan or an individual family service plan by local school districts shall not count against medical
assistance authorization thresholds for that child.
    (h) Nursing services as defined in section 148.171, subdivision 15, and provided as an
individual education plan health-related service, are eligible for medical assistance payment if they
are otherwise a covered service under the medical assistance program. Medical assistance covers
the administration of prescription medications by a licensed nurse who is employed by or under
contract with a school district when the administration of medications is identified in the child's
individualized education plan. The simple administration of medications alone is not covered under
medical assistance when administered by a provider other than a school district or when it is not
identified in the child's individualized education plan.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Estates subject to claims. (a) If a person receives any medical assistance hereunder,
on the person's death, if single, or on the death of the survivor of a married couple, either or both
of whom received medical assistance, or as otherwise provided for in this section, the total amount
paid for medical assistance rendered for the person and spouse shall be filed as a claim against the
estate of the person or the estate of the surviving spouse in the court having jurisdiction to probate
the estate or to issue a decree of descent according to sections 525.31 to 525.313.
   (b) For the purposes of this section, the person's estate must consist of:
   (1) the person's probate estate;
    (2) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in real property the person owned
as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with a right of survivorship at the time of the person's death;
    (3) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in securities the person owned
in beneficiary form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's
death, to the extent the interests or proceeds of those interests become part of the probate estate
under section 524.6-307;
   (4) all of the person's interests in joint accounts, multiple-party accounts, and pay-on-death
accounts, brokerage accounts, investment accounts, or the proceeds of those accounts, as provided
under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death to the extent the interests
become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and

    (5) assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the person through survivorship, living trust,
or other arrangements.
    (c) For the purpose of this section and recovery in a surviving spouse's estate for medical
assistance paid for a predeceased spouse, the estate must consist of all of the legal title and interests
the deceased individual's predeceased spouse had in jointly owned or marital property at the time
of the spouse's death, as defined in subdivision 2b, and the proceeds of those interests, that passed
to the deceased individual or another individual, a survivor, an heir, or an assign of the predeceased
spouse through a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other
arrangement. A deceased recipient who, at death, owned the property jointly with the surviving
spouse shall have an interest in the entire property.
    (d) For the purpose of recovery in a single person's estate or the estate of a survivor of a married
couple, "other arrangement" includes any other means by which title to all or any part of the jointly
owned or marital property or interest passed from the predeceased spouse to another including, but
not limited to, transfers between spouses which are permitted, prohibited, or penalized for purposes
of medical assistance.
    (e) A claim shall be filed if medical assistance was rendered for either or both persons under one
of the following circumstances:
   ­
   (­) (1) the person was over 55 years of age, and received services under this chapter;
    a­
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (2) the person resided in a medical institution for six months or longer, received services
under this chapter, and, at the time of institutionalization or application for medical assistance,
whichever is later, the person could not have reasonably been expected to be discharged and returned
home, as certified in writing by the person's treating physician. For purposes of this section only, a
"medical institution" means a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, intermediate care
facility for persons with developmental disabilities, nursing facility, or inpatient hospital; or
   (­
   ­c­
     ) (3) the person received general assistance medical care services under chapter 256D.
    (f) The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent for the purpose of
section 524.3-805. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency with a
claim under this section must be a creditor under section 524.6-307. Any statute of limitations that
purports to limit any county agency or the state agency, or both, to recover for medical assistance
granted hereunder shall not apply to any claim made hereunder for reimbursement for any medical
assistance granted hereunder. Notice of the claim shall be given to all heirs and devisees of the
decedent whose identity can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The notice must include
procedures and instructions for making an application for a hardship waiver under subdivision 5;
time frames for submitting an application and determination; and information regarding appeal
rights and procedures. Counties are entitled to one-half of the nonfederal share of medical assistance
collections from estates that are directly attributable to county effort. Counties are entitled to ten
percent of the collections for alternative care directly attributable to county effort.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 1h, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1h. Estates of specific persons receiving medical assistance. (a) For purposes of this

owners, remaindermen, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's
estate's interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others,
if the personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the
estate has other assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement
under paragraph ­  (h
                    ­­) (g), or if the claim, as allowed, has been paid in full or to the full extent of the
assets the estate has available to pay it. The affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county
recorder or filed in the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is
located. Except as provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit
shall terminate the decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint
tenant with others. The affidavit shall:
   (1) be signed by the personal representative;
   (2) identify the decedent and the interest being terminated;
    (3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that created the interest in
real property being terminated;
   (4) legally describe the affected real property;
   (5) state that the personal representative has determined that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section;
    (6) state that the decedent's estate has other assets sufficient to pay the claim, as presented,
or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant and the
other owners or remaindermen or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed under this
subdivision; and
   (7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest under this subdivision,
and any other contents as may be appropriate.
The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall
be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording
information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall
be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.

the estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen
or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work
a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder
interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the
property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.
    Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Limitations on claims. The claim shall include only the total amount of medical
assistance rendered after age 55 or during a period of institutionalization described in subdivision

shall not include interest. Claims that have been allowed but not paid shall bear interest according
to section 524.3-806, paragraph (d). A claim against the estate of a surviving spouse who did not
receive medical assistance, for medical assistance rendered for the predeceased spouse, shall be
payable from the full value of all of the predeceased spouse's assets and interests which are part
of the surviving spouse's estate under subdivisions 1a and 2b. Recovery of medical assistance
expenses in the nonrecipient surviving spouse's estate is limited to the value of the assets of the
estate that were marital property or jointly owned property at any time during the marriage. The
claim is not payable from the value of assets or proceeds of assets in the estate attributable to
a predeceased spouse whom the individual married after the death of the predeceased recipient
spouse for whom the claim is filed or from assets and the proceeds of assets in the estate which
the nonrecipient decedent spouse acquired with assets which were not marital property or jointly
owned property after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse. Claims for alternative care
shall be net of all premiums paid under section 256B.0913, subdivision 12, on or after July 1, 2003,
and shall be limited to services provided on or after July 1, 2003. Claims against marital property
shall be limited to claims against recipients who died on or after July 1, 2009.
    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Controlling provisions. (a) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 1a and
2, paragraphs (b) to (d) apply.
    (b) At the time of death of a recipient spouse and solely for purpose of recovery of medical
assistance benefits received, a predeceased recipient spouse shall have a legal title or interest in
the undivided whole of all of the property which the recipient and the recipient's surviving spouse
owned jointly or which was marital property at any time during their marriage regardless of the
form of ownership and regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both
the recipient and the recipient's spouse. Title and interest in the property of a predeceased recipient
spouse shall not end or extinguish upon the person's death and shall continue for the purpose of
allowing recovery of medical assistance in the estate of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the
predeceased recipient spouse, title and interest in the predeceased spouse's property shall vest in the
surviving spouse by operation of law and without the necessity for any probate or decree of descent
proceedings and shall continue to exist after the death of the predeceased spouse and the surviving
spouse to permit recovery of medical assistance. The recipient spouse and the surviving spouse of a
deceased recipient spouse shall not encumber, disclaim, transfer, alienate, hypothecate, or otherwise

divest themselves of these interests before or upon death.
    (c) For purposes of this section, "marital property" includes any and all real or personal property
of any kind or interests in such property the predeceased recipient spouse and their spouse, or
either of them, owned at the time of their marriage to each other or acquired during their marriage
regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both of them. If either or both
spouses of a married couple received medical assistance, all property owned during the marriage or
which either or both spouses acquired during their marriage shall be presumed to be marital property
for purposes of recovering medical assistance unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the
contrary.
     (d) The agency responsible for the claim for medical assistance for a recipient spouse may, at
its discretion, release specific real and personal property from the provisions of this section. The
release shall extinguish the interest created under paragraph (b) in the land it describes upon filing
or recording. The release need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of filing
or recording and shall be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles,
as appropriate, in the county where the real property is located. The party to whom the release is
given shall be responsible for paying all fees and costs necessary to record and file the release. If
the property described in the release is registered property, the registrar of titles shall accept it for
recording and shall record it on the certificate of title for each parcel of property described in the
release. If the property described in the release is abstract property, the recorder shall accept it for
filing and file it in the county's grantor-grantee indexes and any tract index the county maintains for
each parcel of property described in the release.
    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Commissioner's intervention. The commissioner shall be permitted to intervene as a
party in any proceeding involving recovery of medical assistance upon filing a notice of intervention
and serving such notice on the other parties.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.199, is amended to read:
    256B.199 PAYMENTS REPORTED BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES.

1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that

specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with

and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical assistance

each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a
broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan
efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner
may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan,
including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned
no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The
commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23. A managed care

determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services.
If the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application by
providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and a
temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.

     i­ (d) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.

cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    ­ l­ (f) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
     (­)
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.

amount required. The commissioner shall inform applicants and enrollees of these premium payment
options. Premium payment is required before enrollment is complete and to maintain eligibility
in MinnesotaCare. Premium payments received before noon are credited the same day. Premium
payments received after noon are credited on the next working day.
    (d)(1) Effective upon federal approval, nonpayment of the premium will result in disenrollment

from the program may not reenroll until four calendar months have elapsed. The commissioner shall
waive premiums for coverage provided under this paragraph to persons disenrolled for nonpayment
who reapply under section 256L.05, subdivision 3b. Persons disenrolled for nonpayment or who
voluntarily terminate coverage from the program may not reenroll for four calendar months unless
the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment. Good cause does not exist if a person chooses

rule. This paragraph expires July 1, 2009.
   (2) Effective July 1, 2009, nonpayment of the premium will result in disenrollment from the

   Sec. 75. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Sliding fee scale to determine percentage of gross individual or family income.
(a) Effective August 1, 2005, the commissioner shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the
percentage of gross individual or family income that households at different income levels must pay
3318                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [42ND DAY

to obtain coverage through the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the
enrollee's gross individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based
on enrollment of one, two, or three or more persons. The sliding fee scale begins with a premium
of 1.5 percent of gross individual or family income for individuals or families with incomes below
the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999,
and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1, 3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8
percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps ranging from the medical
assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999, to 275 percent of the
federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family size of five. The sliding fee
scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five. Effective October 1, 2003,
the commissioner shall increase each percentage by 0.5 percentage points for enrollees with income
greater than 100 percent but not exceeding 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and shall
increase each percentage by 1.0 percentage points for families and children with incomes greater
than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The sliding fee scale and percentages are not
subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or individual reports increased income after
enrollment, premiums shall not be adjusted until eligibility renewal.
    (b) Effective August 1, 2005, children in families whose gross income is above 275 percent of
the federal poverty guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined
as a base charge for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid
the maximum premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical
coverage and administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten
percent of the total. The costs of medical coverage for children under age two and pregnant women
and the enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two
enrollees shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or
more enrollees shall be three times the maximum premium for one.
   (c) This subdivision expires July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval, whichever is later.
   Sec. 76. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Sliding fee scale to determine monthly gross income. (a) Effective July 1, 2010,
or upon federal approval, whichever is later, the commissioner shall establish a sliding fee scale to
determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or family income that households at different
income levels must pay to obtain coverage through the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee
scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross individual or family income. The sliding fee
scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment of one, two, or three or more persons. The
sliding fee scale begins with a premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross family income for children
with family incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children
in effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January
1, 1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a
family size of five. The sliding fee scale for children in a family of five must be used for children in
families of more than five. Effective July 1, 2009, the commissioner shall increase each percentage
by 0.5 percentage points for enrollees with income greater than 100 percent but not exceeding 200
percent of the federal poverty guidelines and shall increase each percentage by 1.0 percentage points
for families and children with incomes greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines.

The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a child or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval, whichever is later, children in families
whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines shall pay the maximum
premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge for one, two, or three or more enrollees
so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum premium, the total revenue would equal the
total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and administration. In this calculation, administrative
costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of the total. The maximum premium for two enrollees
shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or more enrollees
shall be three times the maximum premium for one.
   Sec. 77. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Exceptions to sliding scale. Effective July 1, 2011, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later, children ages 19 and 20 enrolled under section 256L.04, subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), in families with income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
pay a monthly premium of $4.

under subdivision 3 and United States Code, title 42, section 1396p(d)(4)(A) or (C), shall submit to
the commissioner of human services, at the time of a beneficiary's request for medical assistance,
the following information about the trust:
   (1) a copy of the trust instrument; and
   (2) an inventory of the beneficiary's trust account assets and the value of those assets.
    (b) A trustee of a trust under subdivision 3 and United States Code, title 42, section
1396p(d)(4)(A) or (C), shall submit an accounting of the beneficiary's trust account to the
commissioner of human services at least annually until the trust, or the beneficiary's interest in
the trust, terminates. Accountings are due on the anniversary of the execution date of the trust
unless another annual date is established by the terms of the trust. The accounting must include the
following information for the accounting period:
    (1) an inventory of trust assets and the value of those assets at the beginning of the accounting
period;
   (2) additions to the trust during the accounting period and the source of those additions;
    (3) itemized distributions from the trust during the accounting period, including the purpose of
the distributions and to whom the distributions were made;
   (4) an inventory of trust assets and the value of those assets at the end of the accounting period;

shall provide the commissioner documents and proof necessary to determine their ability to
pay. Failure to provide the commissioner with sufficient information to determine ability to pay
may make the client or relatives liable for the full cost of care until the time when sufficient
information is provided. If it is determined that the responsible party does not have the ability to
pay, the commissioner shall waive payment of the portion that exceeds ability to pay under the

redetermine, what part of the cost of care, if any, the client is able to pay. If the client is unable to pay
the full cost of care, the commissioner shall determine whether the client's relatives have the ability
to pay. The client and relatives shall provide the commissioner documents and proof necessary to
determine their ability to pay. Failure to provide the commissioner with sufficient information to
determine ability to pay may make the client or relatives liable for the full cost of care until the time
when sufficient information is provided. No parent shall be liable for the cost of care given a client
at a regional treatment center after the client has reached the age of 18 years.

    Subd. 1b. Client's county. "Client's county" means the county of the client's legal settlement for
poor relief purposes at the time of commitment. If the client has no legal settlement for poor relief
in this state, it means the county of commitment, except that when a client with no legal settlement
for poor relief is committed while serving a sentence at a penal institution, it means the county from
which the client was sentenced.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 246B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Cost of care. "Cost of care" means the commissioner's charge for housing and
treatment services provided to any person admitted to the Minnesota sex offender program.
    For purposes of this subdivision, "charge for housing and treatment services" means the cost of

and equipment, and indirect costs related to the operation of state facilities. The commissioner may
determine the charge for services on an anticipated average per diem basis as an all-inclusive charge
per facility.

    Subdivision 1. Procedures. The commissioner shall make investigation as necessary to
determine, and as circumstances require redetermine, what part of the cost of care, if any, the
client is able to pay. The client shall provide the commissioner documents and proof necessary to
determine the ability to pay. Failure to provide the commissioner with sufficient information to
determine ability to pay may make the client liable for the full cost of care until the time when
sufficient information is provided.
    Subd. 2. Rules. The commissioner shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act,
rules establishing uniform standards for determination of client liability for care provided by the
Minnesota sex offender program. These rules shall have the force and effect of law.

care given the client, less the amount actually paid toward the cost of care by the client, shall be filed
by the commissioner as a claim against the estate of the client with the court having jurisdiction to
probate the estate and all proceeds collected by the state in the case shall be divided between the
state and county in proportion to the cost of care each has borne.
    Subd. 2. Preferred status. An estate claim in subdivision 1 shall be considered an expense of
the last illness for purposes of section 524.3-805.
    If the commissioner of human services determines that the property or estate of a client is not
more than needed to care for and maintain the spouse and minor or dependent children of a deceased
client, the commissioner has the power to compromise the claim of the state in a manner deemed
just and proper.
    Subd. 3. Exception from statute of limitations. Any statute of limitations that limits the
commissioner in recovering the cost of care obligation incurred by a client or former client must
not apply to any claim against an estate made under this section to recover cost of care.
   Sec. 15. [246B.10] LIABILITY OF COUNTY; REIMBURSEMENT.

from the county's own sources of revenue and payments shall equal ten percent of the cost of care,
as determined by the commissioner, for each day or portion of a day, that the client spends at the
facility. If payments received by the state under sections 246.50 to 246.53 exceed 90 percent of the
cost of care, the county shall be responsible for paying the state only the remaining amount. The
county shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the client, the client's estate, or from the client's
relatives, except as provided in section 246B.07.

lead work outside of the person's property must obtain certification as a lead firm. The certificate
must be in writing, contain an expiration date, be signed by the commissioner, and give the name
and address of the person to whom it is issued. The certification fee is $100, is nonrefundable, and
must be submitted with each application. The certificate or a copy of the certificate must be readily
available at the worksite for review by the contracting entity, the commissioner, and other public
health officials charged with the health, safety, and welfare of the state's citizens.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9505, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Notice of regulated lead work. (a) At least five working days before starting work
at each regulated lead worksite, the person performing the regulated lead work shall give written
notice to the commissioner and the appropriate board of health.
    (b) This provision does not apply to lead hazard screen, lead inspection, lead risk assessment,
lead sampling technician, renovation, or lead project design activities.
     Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9508, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Regulated lead work standards and methods. (a) The commissioner shall adopt rules
establishing regulated lead work standards and methods in accordance with the provisions of this
section, for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, and soil in a manner that protects public health and
the environment for all residences, including residences also used for a commercial purpose, child
care facilities, playgrounds, and schools.
    (b) In the rules required by this section, the commissioner shall require lead hazard reduction
of intact paint only if the commissioner finds that the intact paint is on a chewable or lead-dust
producing surface that is a known source of actual lead exposure to a specific individual. The
commissioner shall prohibit methods that disperse lead dust into the air that could accumulate to
a level that would exceed the lead dust standard specified under this section. The commissioner
shall work cooperatively with the commissioner of administration to determine which lead
hazard reduction methods adopted under this section may be used for lead-safe practices
including prohibited practices, preparation, disposal, and cleanup. The commissioner shall
work cooperatively with the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency to develop disposal
procedures. In adopting rules under this section, the commissioner shall require the best available
technology for regulated lead work methods, paint stabilization, and repainting.
    (c) The commissioner of health shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead
in bare soil in a manner to protect public health and the environment. The commissioner shall adopt
a maximum standard of 100 parts of lead per million in bare soil. The commissioner shall set a soil
replacement standard not to exceed 25 parts of lead per million. Soil lead hazard reduction methods

shall focus on erosion control and covering of bare soil.
    (d) The commissioner shall adopt regulated lead work standards and methods for lead in dust
in a manner to protect the public health and environment. Dust standards shall use a weight of lead
per area measure and include dust on the floor, on the window sills, and on window wells. Lead
hazard reduction methods for dust shall focus on dust removal and other practices which minimize
the formation of lead dust from paint, soil, or other sources.
    (e) The commissioner shall adopt lead hazard reduction standards and methods for lead in
drinking water both at the tap and public water supply system or private well in a manner to protect
the public health and the environment. The commissioner may adopt the rules for controlling lead
in drinking water as contained in Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, part 141. Drinking water
lead hazard reduction methods may include an educational approach of minimizing lead exposure
from lead in drinking water.
    (f) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall adopt rules to ensure that removal
of exterior lead-based coatings from residences and steel structures by abrasive blasting methods is
conducted in a manner that protects health and the environment.
   (g) All regulated lead work standards shall provide reasonable margins of safety that
are consistent with more than a summary review of scientific evidence and an emphasis on
overprotection rather than underprotection when the scientific evidence is ambiguous.
   (h) No unit of local government shall have an ordinance or regulation governing regulated lead
work standards or methods for lead in paint, dust, drinking water, or soil that require a different
regulated lead work standard or method than the standards or methods established under this section.
   (i) Notwithstanding paragraph (h), the commissioner may approve the use by a unit of local
government of an innovative lead hazard reduction method which is consistent in approach with
methods established under this section.
    (j) The commissioner shall adopt rules for issuing lead orders required under section 144.9504,
rules for notification of abatement or interim control activities requirements, and other rules
necessary to implement sections 144.9501 to 144.9512.
   (k) The commissioners shall adopt rules consistent with section 402(c)(3) of the Toxic
Substances Control Act to ensure that renovation is a pre-1978 affected property where a child or
pregnant female resides is conducted in a manner that protects health and the environment.
   (l) The commissioner shall adopt rules consistent with sections 406(a) and 406(b) of the Toxic
Substances Control Act.
    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.9508, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

     Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Available programs, categories, and analytes. (a) The commissioner shall accredit
laboratories that test samples under the following programs:
   (1) the clean water program, such as compliance monitoring under the federal Clean Water Act,
and ambient monitoring of surface and ground water, or analysis of biological tissue;
   (2) the safe drinking water program, including compliance monitoring under the federal Safe
Drinking Water Act, and the state requirements for monitoring private wells;
   (3) the resource conservation and recovery program, including federal and state requirements for
monitoring solid and hazardous wastes, biological tissue, leachates, and ground water monitoring
wells not intended as drinking water sources;
     (4) the underground storage tank program; and
   (5) the clean air program, including air and emissions testing under the federal Clean Air Act,
and state and federal requirements for vapor intrusion monitoring.
   (b) The commissioner shall maintain and publish a list of analytes available for accreditation.
The list must be reviewed at least once every six months and the changes published in the State
Register and posted on the program's Web site. The commissioner shall publish the notification of
changes and review comments on the changes no less than 30 days from the date the list is published.
     Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3b. Additional fees. (a) Laboratories located outside of this state that require an on-site
assessment more frequent than once every two years must pay an additional assessed fee of $3,000
per assessment for each additional on-site assessment conducted. The laboratory must pay the fee
within 15 business days of receiving the commissioner's notification that an on-site assessment is
required. The commissioner may conduct additional on-site assessments to determine a laboratory's
continued compliance with the standards provided in subdivision 2a.

   (b) A late fee of $200 shall be added to the annual fee for accredited laboratories submitting
renewal applications to the commissioner after November 1.
    (c) A change fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests additional fields of testing at any
time other than when initially applying for or renewing its accreditation. A change fee does not
apply for applications to add fields of testing for new analytes in response to the published notice
under subdivision 3a, paragraph (b), if the laboratory holds valid accreditation for the changed test
category and applies for additional analytes within the same test category. The change fee is equal
to the applicable test category fee for the field of testing requested. An application that requests
accreditation of multiple fields of testing within a test category requires a single payment of the
applicable test category fee per application submitted.
    (d) A variance fee shall be assessed if a laboratory requests a variance from a standard provided
in subdivision 2a. The variance fee is $500 per variance.
   (e) The commissioner shall assess a fee for changes to laboratory information regarding
ownership, name, address, or personnel. Laboratories must submit changes through the application
process under subdivision 6. The information update fee is $250 per application.
   (f) Fees must be set so that the total fees support the laboratory accreditation program. Direct
costs of the accreditation service include program administration, assessments, the agency's general
support costs, and attorney general costs attributable to the fee function.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

received but not approved. Accreditation of a laboratory shall not be awarded until all fees are paid.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Application. (a) Laboratories seeking accreditation must apply on a form provided by
the commissioner, include the laboratory's procedures and quality manual, and pay the applicable
fees.
   (b) Laboratories may be fixed-base or mobile. The commissioner shall accredit mobile
laboratories individually and require a vehicle identification number, license plate number, or other
uniquely identifying information in addition to the application requirements of paragraph (a).
   (c) Laboratories maintained on separate properties, even though operated under the same
management or ownership, must apply separately. Laboratories with more than one building on the
same or adjoining properties do not need to submit a separate application.
    (d) The commissioner may accredit laboratories located out-of-state. Accreditation for
out-of-state laboratories may be obtained directly from the commissioner following the
requirements in paragraph (a), or out-of-state laboratories may be accredited through a reciprocal
agreement if the laboratory:
    (1) is accredited by a NELAP-recognized accreditation body for those fields of testing in which
the laboratory requests accreditation from the commissioner;
   (2) submits an application and documentation according to this subdivision; and

   (3) submits a current copy of the laboratory's unexpired accreditation from a NELAP-recognized
accreditation body showing the fields of accreditation for which the laboratory is currently
accredited.
    (e) Under the conflict of interest determinations provided in section 43A.38, subdivision 6,
clause (a), the commissioner shall not accredit governmental laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state. If accreditation is required, laboratories operated by agencies of
the executive branch of the state must apply for accreditation through any other NELAP-recognized
accreditation body.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 6a. Implementation and effective date. All laboratories must comply with standards
under this section by July 1, 2009. Fees under subdivisions 3 and 3b apply to applications received
and accreditations issued after June 30, 2009. Accreditations issued on or after June 30, 2009, shall
expire upon their current expiration date.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.98, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Initial accreditation and annual accreditation renewal. (a) The commissioner
shall issue or renew accreditation after receipt of the completed application and documentation
required in this section, provided the laboratory maintains compliance with the standards specified
in subdivision 2a, and attests to the compliance on the application form.
   (b) The commissioner shall prorate the fees in subdivision 3 for laboratories applying for
accreditation after December 31. The fees are prorated on a quarterly basis beginning with the
quarter in which the commissioner receives the completed application from the laboratory.
   (c) Applications for renewal of accreditation must be received by November 1 and no earlier
than October 1 of each year. The commissioner shall send annual renewal notices to laboratories
90 days before expiration. Failure to receive a renewal notice does not exempt laboratories from
meeting the annual November 1 renewal date.
    (d) The commissioner shall issue all accreditations for the calendar year for which the application
is made, and the accreditation shall expire on December 31 of that year.
    (e) The accreditation of any laboratory that fails to submit a renewal application and fees to
the commissioner expires automatically on December 31 without notice or further proceeding.
Any person who operates a laboratory as accredited after expiration of accreditation or without
having submitted an application and paid the fees is in violation of the provisions of this section
and is subject to enforcement action under sections 144.989 to 144.993, the Health Enforcement
Consolidation Act. A laboratory with expired accreditation may reapply under subdivision 6.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.

and shall be posted at conspicuous locations throughout the park. The park owner shall provide each
resident with a copy of the approved shelter or evacuation plan, as provided by section 327C.01,
subdivision 1c. Nothing in this paragraph requires the Department of Health to review or approve
any shelter or evacuation plan developed by a park. Failure of a municipality to approve a plan
submitted by a park shall not be grounds for action against the park by the Department of Health if
the park has made a good faith effort to develop the plan and obtain municipal approval.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.04, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
    Subd. 16. Personal care services. (a) Notwithstanding any contrary language in this paragraph,
the commissioner of human services and the commissioner of health shall jointly promulgate rules
to be applied to the licensure of personal care services provided under the medical assistance
program. The rules shall consider standards for personal care services that are based on the World
Institute on Disability's recommendations regarding personal care services. These rules shall at a
minimum consider the standards and requirements adopted by the commissioner of health under
section 144A.45, which the commissioner of human services determines are applicable to the
provision of personal care services, in addition to other standards or modifications which the
commissioner of human services determines are appropriate.
    The commissioner of human services shall establish an advisory group including personal care
consumers and providers to provide advice regarding which standards or modifications should be
adopted. The advisory group membership must include not less than 15 members, of which at
least 60 percent must be consumers of personal care services and representatives of recipients with
various disabilities and diagnoses and ages. At least 51 percent of the members of the advisory group
must be recipients of personal care.
    The commissioner of human services may contract with the commissioner of health to enforce
the jointly promulgated licensure rules for personal care service providers.
    Prior to final promulgation of the joint rule the commissioner of human services shall report
preliminary findings along with any comments of the advisory group and a plan for monitoring and
enforcement by the Department of Health to the legislature by February 15, 1992.
   Limits on the extent of personal care services that may be provided to an individual must be
based on the cost-effectiveness of the services in relation to the costs of inpatient hospital care,
nursing home care, and other available types of care. The rules must provide, at a minimum:
    (1) that agencies be selected to contract with or employ and train staff to provide and supervise
the provision of personal care services;

    (2) that agencies employ or contract with a qualified applicant that a qualified recipient proposes
to the agency as the recipient's choice of assistant;
    (3) that agencies bill the medical assistance program for a personal care service by a personal care
assistant and supervision by a qualified professional supervising the personal care assistant unless
the recipient selects the fiscal agent option under section ­  2­56

through an agency in a particular county, when there are less than two agencies providing services
in that county and shall waive the requirement for personal care assistants required to join an agency
for the first time during 1993 when personal care services are provided under a relative hardship
waiver under Minnesota Statutes 1992, section 256B.0627, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (7),
and at least two agencies providing personal care services have refused to employ or contract with
the independent personal care assistant.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.055, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Disabled children. (a) A person is eligible for medical assistance if the person is under
age 19 and qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section 1382c(a), and
would be eligible for medical assistance under the state plan if residing in a medical institution, and
the child requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities, for whom home care is appropriate, provided that the
cost to medical assistance under this section is not more than the amount that medical assistance
would pay for if the child resides in an institution. After the child is determined to be eligible under
this section, the commissioner shall review the child's disability under United States Code, title
42, section 1382c(a) and level of care defined under this section no more often than annually and
may elect, based on the recommendation of health care professionals under contract with the state
medical review team, to extend the review of disability and level of care up to a maximum of four
years. The commissioner's decision on the frequency of continuing review of disability and level of
care is not subject to administrative appeal under section 256.045. The county agency shall send a
notice of disability review to the enrollee six months prior to the date the recertification of disability
is due. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting other redeterminations of medical
assistance eligibility under this chapter and annual cost-effective reviews under this section.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means an institution as defined in section
144.696, subdivision 3, 144.55, subdivision 3, or Minnesota Rules, part 4640.3600, and licensed
pursuant to sections 144.50 to 144.58. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of
care provided in a hospital if the child is determined by the commissioner to need an extensive
array of health services, including mental health services, for an undetermined period of time,
whose health condition requires frequent monitoring and treatment by a health care professional
or by a person supervised by a health care professional, who would reside in a hospital or require
frequent hospitalization if these services were not provided, and the daily care needs are more
complex than a nursing facility level of care.
   A child with serious emotional disturbance requires a level of care provided in a hospital if

the commissioner determines that the individual requires 24-hour supervision because the person
exhibits recurrent or frequent suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, recurrent or frequent
psychosomatic disorders or somatopsychic disorders that may become life threatening, recurrent or
frequent severe socially unacceptable behavior associated with psychiatric disorder, ongoing and
chronic psychosis or severe, ongoing and chronic developmental problems requiring continuous
skilled observation, or severe disabling symptoms for which office-centered outpatient treatment is
not adequate, and which overall severely impact the individual's ability to function.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "nursing facility" means a facility which provides nursing
care as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, licensed pursuant to sections 144A.02 to 144A.10,
which is appropriate if a person is in active restorative treatment; is in need of special treatments
provided or supervised by a licensed nurse; or has unpredictable episodes of active disease processes
requiring immediate judgment by a licensed nurse. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires
the level of care provided in a nursing facility if the child is determined by the commissioner to meet
the requirements of the preadmission screening assessment document under section 256B.0911 and
the home care independent rating document under section ­          2­

    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities" or "ICF/MR" means a program licensed to provide services to persons with
developmental disabilities under section 252.28, and chapter 245A, and a physical plant licensed
as a supervised living facility under chapter 144, which together are certified by the Minnesota
Department of Health as meeting the standards in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part
483, for an intermediate care facility which provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities who require 24-hour supervision and active treatment for medical, behavioral, or
habilitation needs. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of care provided in an
ICF/MR if the commissioner finds that the child has a developmental disability in accordance with
section 256B.092, is in need of a 24-hour plan of care and active treatment similar to persons with
developmental disabilities, and there is a reasonable indication that the child will need ICF/MR
services.
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a person requires the level of care provided in a nursing
facility if the person requires 24-hour monitoring or supervision and a plan of mental health
treatment because of specific symptoms or functional impairments associated with a serious mental
illness or disorder diagnosis, which meet severity criteria for mental health established by the
commissioner and published in March 1997 as the Minnesota Mental Health Level of Care for
Children and Adolescents with Severe Emotional Disorders.
    (f) The determination of the level of care needed by the child shall be made by the commissioner
based on information supplied to the commissioner by the parent or guardian, the child's physician
or physicians, and other professionals as requested by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
establish a screening team to conduct the level of care determinations according to this subdivision.
    (g) If a child meets the conditions in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e), the commissioner must assess
the case to determine whether:
   (1) the child qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section
1382c(a), and would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a medical institution; and

    (2) the cost of medical assistance services for the child, if eligible under this subdivision, would
not be more than the cost to medical assistance if the child resides in a medical institution to be
determined as follows:
    (i) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the cost of care for the child
in an institution shall be determined using the average payment rate established for the regional
treatment centers that are certified as ICF's/MR;
    (ii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an inpatient hospital setting according to
paragraph (b), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3520,
items F and G; and
    (iii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in a nursing facility according to paragraph
(c) or (e), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3040,
except that the nursing facility average rate shall be adjusted to reflect rates which would be paid
for children under age 16. The commissioner may authorize an amount up to the amount medical
assistance would pay for a child referred to the commissioner by the preadmission screening team
under section 256B.0911.
    (h) Children eligible for medical assistance services under section 256B.055, subdivision 12, as
of June 30, 1995, must be screened according to the criteria in this subdivision prior to January 1,
1996. Children found to be ineligible may not be removed from the program until January 1, 1996.

    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0625, subdivision 19a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 19a. Personal care assistant services. Medical assistance covers personal care
assistant services in a recipient's home. To qualify for personal care assistant services, recipients
or responsible parties must be able to identify the recipient's needs, direct and evaluate task
accomplishment, and provide for health and safety. Approved hours may be used outside the home
when normal life activities take them outside the home. To use personal care assistant services
at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan
identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school. Total hours
for services, whether actually performed inside or outside the recipient's home, cannot exceed that
which is otherwise allowed for personal care assistant services in an in-home setting according to
sections 256B.0651 ­       an

cover personal care assistant services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care
facility, health care facility licensed by the commissioner of health, or unless a resident who is
otherwise eligible is on leave from the facility and the facility either pays for the personal care
assistant services or forgoes the facility per diem for the leave days that personal care assistant
services are used. All personal care assistant services must be provided according to sections
256B.0651 ­     an

be reimbursed if the personal care assistant is the spouse or legal guardian of the recipient or the
parent of a recipient under age 18, or the responsible party or the foster care provider of a recipient
who cannot direct the recipient's own care unless, in the case of a foster care provider, a county or
state case manager visits the recipient as needed, but not less than every six months, to monitor
the health and safety of the recipient and to ensure the goals of the care plan are met. Parents of
adult recipients, adult children of the recipient or adult siblings of the recipient may be reimbursed
for personal care assistant services, if they are granted a waiver under sections 256B.0651 ­               an

increase appropriated for home and community-based services; or
    (2) an amount approved by the commissioner based on the recipient's extraordinary needs that
cannot be met within the current allowable reimbursement level. The increased reimbursement level
must be necessary to allow the recipient to be discharged from an institution or to prevent imminent
placement in an institution. The additional reimbursement may be used to secure environmental
modifications; assistive technology and equipment; and increased costs for supervision, training,
and support services necessary to address the recipient's extraordinary needs. The commissioner
may approve an increased reimbursement level for up to one year of the recipient's relocation from
an institution or up to six months of a determination that a current waiver recipient is at imminent
risk of being placed in an institution.

    (b) The county board shall determine the appropriate level of care when county-controlled funds
are used to pay for the services. When the child is enrolled in a prepaid health program under section
256B.69, the enrolled child's contracted health plan must determine the appropriate level of care.
When the child is an Indian tribal member seeking placement through the tribe in a tribally operated
or contracted facility, the tribe must determine the appropriate level of care. When more than one
entity bears responsibility for coverage, the entities shall coordinate level of care determination
activities to the extent possible.
     (c) The level of care determination shall determine whether the proposed treatment:
     (1) is necessary;
     (2) is appropriate to the child's individual treatment needs;
     (3) cannot be effectively provided in the child's home; and
     (4) provides a length of stay as short as possible consistent with the individual child's need.

                                   l is not appropriate solely because services were not first provided to
the child in a less restrictive setting and the child failed to make progress toward or meet treatment
goals in the less restrictive setting. The level of care determination must be based on a diagnostic
assessment that includes a functional assessment which evaluates family, school, and community
living situations; and an assessment of the child's need for care out of the home using a validated tool
which assesses a child's functional status and assigns an appropriate level of care. The validated tool
must be approved by the commissioner of human services. If a diagnostic assessment including a
functional assessment has been completed by a mental health professional within the past 180 days, a
new diagnostic assessment need not be completed unless in the opinion of the current treating mental
health professional the child's mental health status has changed markedly since the assessment was
completed. The child's parent shall be notified if an assessment will not be completed and of the
reasons. A copy of the notice shall be placed in the child's file. Recommendations developed as
part of the level of care determination process shall include specific community services needed by
the child and, if appropriate, the child's family, and shall indicate whether or not these services are
available and accessible to the child and family.
    During the level of care determination process, the child, child's family, or child's legal
representative, as appropriate, must be informed of the child's eligibility for case management
services and family community support services and that an individual family community support
plan is being developed by the case manager, if assigned.

for the remainder of the calendar year up to the total amount of the allocation.
   (d) By January 31, 2012, and each year thereafter, counties shall report actual expenditures for
detoxification services for the prior year. The commissioner shall reallocate unexpended funds to

    Subdivision 1. Application fee. A person applying for a license to practice veterinary medicine
in Minnesota or applying for a permit to take the national veterinary medical examination must pay
a $60 nonrefundable application fee to the board. Persons submitting concurrent applications for
licensure and a national examination permit shall pay only one application fee.
   Subd. 2. Examination fees. (a) An applicant for veterinary licensure in Minnesota must
successfully pass the Minnesota Veterinary Jurisprudence Examination. The fee for this
examination is $60, payable to the board.
    (b) An applicant participating in the national veterinary licensing examination must complete
a separate application for the national examination and submit the application to the board for
approval. Payment for the national examination must be made by the applicant to the national board
examination committee.
   Sec. 11. [156.012] INITIAL AND RENEWAL FEE.
    Subdivision 1. Required for licensure. A person now licensed to practice veterinary medicine
in this state, or who becomes licensed by the Board of Veterinary Medicine to engage in the
practice, shall pay an initial fee or a biennial license renewal fee if the person wishes to practice
veterinary medicine in the coming two-year period or remain licensed as a veterinarian. A licensure
period begins on March 1 and expires the last day of February two years later. A licensee with an
even-numbered license shall renew by March 1 of even-numbered years and a licensee with an
odd-numbered license shall renew by March 1 of odd-numbered years.
    Subd. 2. Amount. The initial licensure fee and the biennial renewal fee is $280 and must be paid
to the executive director of the board. By January 1 of the first year for which the biennial renewal fee
is due, the board shall issue a renewal application to a current licensee to the last address maintained
in the board file. Failure to receive this notice does not relieve the licensee of the obligation to pay
renewal fees so that they are received by the board on or before the renewal date of March 1.
    Initial licenses issued after the start of the licensure renewal period are valid only until the end
of the period.
    Subd. 3. Date due. A licensee must apply for a renewal license on or before March 1 of the first
year of the biennial license renewal period. A renewal license is valid from March 1 through the last
day of February of the last year of the two-year license renewal period. An application postmarked
no later than the last day of February must be considered to have been received on March 1.

    Subd. 4. Late renewal penalty. An applicant for renewal must pay a late renewal penalty of
$140 in addition to the renewal fee if the application for renewal is received after March 1 of the
licensure renewal period. A renewed license issued after March 1 of the licensure renewal period is
valid only to the end of the period regardless of when the renewal fee is received.
    Subd. 5. Reinstatement fee. An applicant for license renewal whose license has previously been
suspended by official board action for nonrenewal must pay a reinstatement fee of $60 in addition
to the $280 renewal fee and the $140 late renewal penalty.
    Subd. 6. Penalty for failure to pay. Within 30 days after the renewal date, a licensee who has
not renewed the license must be notified by letter sent to the last known address of the licensee in
the file of the board that the renewal is overdue and that failure to pay the current fee and current late
fee within 60 days after the renewal date will result in suspension of the license. A second notice
must be sent by registered or certified mail at least seven days before a board meeting occurring 60
days or more after the renewal date to a licensee who has not paid the renewal fee and late fee.
    Subd. 7. Suspension. The board, by means of a roll call vote, shall suspend the license of a
licensee whose license renewal is at least 60 days overdue and to whom notification has been sent
as provided in subpart 5. Failure of a licensee to receive notification is not grounds for later challenge
by the licensee of the suspension. The former licensee must be notified by registered or certified letter
within seven days of the board action. The suspended status placed on a license may be removed
only on payment of renewal fees and late penalty fees for each licensure period or part of a period
that the license was not renewed. A licensee who fails to renew a license for five years or more must
meet the criteria of section 156.071, for relicensure.
    Subd. 8. Inactive license. (a) A person holding a current active license to practice veterinary
medicine in Minnesota may, at the time of the person's next biennial license renewal date, renew
the license as an inactive license at one-half the renewal fee of an active license. The license may
be continued in an inactive status by renewal on a biennial basis at one-half the regular license fee.
   (b) A person holding an inactive license is not permitted to practice veterinary medicine in
Minnesota and remains under the disciplinary authority of the board.
   (c) A person may convert a current inactive license to an active license upon application to and
approval by the board. The application must include:
   (1) documentation of licensure in good standing and of having met continuing education
requirements of current state of practice, or documentation of having met Minnesota continuing
education requirements retroactive to the date of licensure inactivation;
   (2) certification by the applicant that the applicant is not currently under disciplinary orders or
investigation for acts that could result in disciplinary action in any other jurisdiction; and
    (3) payment of a fee equal to the full difference between an inactive and active license if
converting during the first year of the biennial license cycle or payment of a fee equal to one-half
the difference between an inactive and an active license if converting during the second year of
the license cycle.
    (d) Deadline for renewal of an inactive license is March 1 of the first year of the biennial license
renewal period. A late renewal penalty of one-half the inactive renewal fee must be paid if renewal
is received after March 1.

qualified to an annuity from each fund if total allowable service in all funds or in any two of these
funds totals three or more years.
    (b) If the combination of retirement plans includes the correctional state employees retirement
plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System, no retirement annuity is payable from the
correctional state employees retirement plan unless the person has credit for at least ten years of
covered correctional service under section 352.91, although any covered correctional service may
be used to establish eligibility for an annuity from another retirement plan and a service credit
transfer under section 352.93, subdivision 4a, may be elected.
    (c) This section applies to the Minnesota State Retirement System, the Public Employees
Retirement Association including the Public Employees Retirement Association police and
fire fund, the Teachers Retirement Association, the State Patrol Retirement Association, or any
other public employee retirement system in the state with a similar provision, except as noted in

been taken from any one of these funds since service entitling the employee to coverage under the
system or the employee's membership in any of the associations last terminated. The annuity from
each fund must be determined by the appropriate provisions of the law except that the requirement
that a person must have at least three years allowable service in the respective system or association

equals three or more years.

annuity.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.93, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Service credit transfer and partial refund in certain instances. An employee
covered under section 352.91 who has reached the age of 55 years and who has credit for less
than ten years of covered correctional service may, upon written application, have that covered
correctional service credited as allowable service credit in the general state employees retirement
plan and used to calculate a retirement annuity under sections 352.115 and 352.116, and receive,
30 days following retirement, a refund of that portion of employee contributions during covered
correctional service under section 352.92, subdivision 1, that exceeds the employee contributions
required under the general state employees retirement plan under section 352.04, subdivision 2, for
the same period, plus annual compound interest on the partial refund amount from the date of each
contribution until the date of refund payment at the rate of six percent.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.30, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility; computation of annuity. (a) Notwithstanding any provisions of
the laws governing the retirement plans enumerated in subdivision 3, a person who has met the
qualifications of paragraph (b) may elect to receive a retirement annuity from each enumerated
retirement plan, other than the correctional state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State
Retirement System, in which the person has at least one-half year of allowable service, based on
the allowable service in each plan, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c).
    (b) A person may receive, upon retirement, a retirement annuity from each enumerated
retirement plan, other than the correctional state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota
State Retirement System, in which the person has at least one-half year of allowable service, and
augmentation of a deferred annuity calculated at the appropriate rate under the laws governing
each public pension plan or fund named in subdivision 3, based on the date of the person's initial
entry into public employment from the date the person terminated all public service if:
   (1) the person has allowable service totaling an amount that allows the person to receive an
annuity in any two or more of the enumerated plans; and
    (2) the person has not begun to receive an annuity from any enumerated plan or the person has
made application for benefits from each applicable plan and the effective dates of the retirement
annuity with each plan under which the person chooses to receive an annuity are within a one-year
period.
    (c) The retirement annuity from each plan must be based upon the allowable service, accrual
rates, and average salary in the applicable plan except as further specified or modified in the
following clauses:
    (1) the laws governing annuities must be the law in effect on the date of termination from the last
period of public service under a covered retirement plan with which the person earned a minimum
of one-half year of allowable service credit during that employment;
   (2) the "average salary" on which the annuity from each covered plan in which the employee has

credit in a formula plan must be based on the employee's highest five successive years of covered
salary during the entire service in covered plans;
   (3) the accrual rates to be used by each plan must be those percentages prescribed by each
plan's formula as continued for the respective years of allowable service from one plan to the next,
recognizing all previous allowable service with the other covered plans;
    (4) the allowable service in all the plans must be combined in determining eligibility for and the
application of each plan's provisions in respect to reduction in the annuity amount for retirement
prior to normal retirement age; ­ an

plan must not be affected, but such service and covered salary must be used in the above calculation.

and
    (6) for a person who was a member of the correctional state employees retirement plan, the
person must have at least ten years of covered correctional service under section 352.91 in order to
receive a retirement annuity from that plan, but may apply for a service credit transfer and partial
refund under section 352.93, subdivision 4a.
   (d) This section does not apply to any person whose final termination from the last public service
under a covered plan was before May 1, 1975.
    (e) For the purpose of computing annuities under this section, the accrual rates used by any
covered plan, except the public employees police and fire plan, the judges retirement fund, and the
State Patrol retirement plan, must not exceed the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision
4, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The formula percentage used
by the judges retirement fund must not exceed the percentage rate specified in section 356.315,
subdivision 8, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate used
by the public employees police and fire plan and the State Patrol retirement plan must not exceed
the percentage rate specified in section 356.315, subdivision 6, per year of service for any year of
service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate or rates used by the legislators retirement plan must not
exceed 2.5 percent, but this limit does not apply to the adjustment provided under section 3A.02,
subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
   (f) Any period of time for which a person has credit in more than one of the covered plans must
be used only once for the purpose of determining total allowable service.
    (g) If the period of duplicated service credit is more than one-half year, or the person has credit for
more than one-half year, with each of the plans, each plan must apply its formula to a prorated service
credit for the period of duplicated service based on a fraction of the salary on which deductions were
paid to that fund for the period divided by the total salary on which deductions were paid to all plans
for the period.
    (h) If the period of duplicated service credit is less than one-half year, or when added to other
service credit with that plan is less than one-half year, the service credit must be ignored and a refund
of contributions made to the person in accord with that plan's refund provisions.

(2) to provide any additional amounts under
Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, section
264.5, that relate to replacement of TANF
funds due to the operation of TANF penalties;

from sources other than state funds for the
purpose of financing the cost of assistance
program grants or nongrant administration.
All additional funding is appropriated to the
commissioner for use as designated by the
grantor of funding.
SYSTEMS CONTINUITY. In the event of
disruption of technical systems or computer
operations, the commissioner may use
available grant appropriations to ensure
continuity of payments for maintaining the
health, safety, and well-being of clients served
by programs administered by the department
of human services. Grant funds must be used
in a manner consistent with the original intent
of the appropriation.
NONFEDERAL SHARE TRANSFERS. The
nonfederal share of activities for which
federal administrative reimbursement is
appropriated to the commissioner may be
transferred to the special revenue fund.
TANF FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO OTHER
ENTITIES. Any expenditures from the TANF
block grant shall be expended in accordance
with the requirements and limitations of
part A of title IV of the Social Security
Act, as amended, and any other applicable
federal requirement or limitation. Prior to any
expenditure of these funds, the commissioner
shall assure that funds are expended in
compliance with the requirements and
limitations of federal law and that any
reporting requirements of federal law are
3408                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [42ND DAY

met. It shall be the responsibility of any entity
to which these funds are appropriated to
implement a memorandum of understanding
with the commissioner that provides the
necessary assurance of compliance prior to
any expenditure of funds. The commissioner
shall receipt TANF funds appropriated
to other state agencies and coordinate all
related interagency accounting transactions
necessary to implement these appropriations.
Unexpended TANF funds appropriated to
any state, local, or nonprofit entity cancel
at the end of the state fiscal year unless
appropriating language permits otherwise.
TANF FUNDS TRANSFERRED TO OTHER
FEDERAL GRANTS. The commissioner
must authorize transfers from TANF to other
federal block grants so that funds are available
to meet the annual expenditure needs as
appropriated. Transfers may be authorized
prior to the expenditure year with the
agreement of the receiving entity. Transferred
funds must be expended in the year for
which the funds were appropriated unless
appropriation language permits otherwise.
In accelerating transfer authorizations, the
commissioner must aim to preserve the future
potential transfer capacity from TANF to
other block grants.
TANF MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT. (a) In
order to meet the basic maintenance of effort
(MOE) requirements of the TANF block grant

costs under Minnesota Statutes, section
42ND DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009   3409

(3) state and county MFIP administrative
costs under Minnesota Statutes, chapters 256J

Statutes, section 256B.06, subdivision 4,
paragraphs (d), (e), and (j); and
(6) qualifying working family credit
expenditures under Minnesota Statutes,
section 290.0671.
(b) The commissioner shall ensure that
sufficient qualified nonfederal expenditures
are made each year to meet the state's
TANF/MOE requirements. For the activities
listed in paragraph (a), clauses (2) to
(6), the commissioner may only report
expenditures that are excluded from the
definition of assistance under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 260.31.
(c) By August 31 of each year, the
commissioner shall make a preliminary
calculation to determine the likelihood that
the state will meet its annual federal work
participation requirement under Code of
Federal Regulations, title 45, sections 261.21
and 261.23, after adjustment for any caseload
reduction credit under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 261.41. If the
commissioner determines that the state will
meet its federal work participation rate for the
federal fiscal year ending that September, the
commissioner may reduce the expenditure
under paragraph (a), clause (1), to the extent
allowed under Code of Federal Regulations,
title 45, section 263.1(a)(2).
(d) For fiscal years beginning with state
fiscal year 2003, the commissioner shall
3410                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [42ND DAY

assure that the maintenance of effort used
by the commissioner of finance for the
February and November forecasts required
under Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.103,
contains expenditures under paragraph (a),
clause (1), equal to at least 25 percent of
the total required under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 45, section 263.1.
(e) If nonfederal expenditures for the
programs and purposes listed in paragraph
(a) are insufficient to meet the state's
TANF/MOE requirements, the commissioner
shall recommend additional allowable
sources of nonfederal expenditures to the
legislature, if the legislature is or will be in
session to take action to specify additional
sources of nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE before a federal penalty is
imposed. The commissioner shall otherwise
provide notice to the legislative commission
on planning and fiscal policy under paragraph
(g).
(f) If the commissioner uses authority
granted under section 11, or similar authority
granted by a subsequent legislature, to meet
the state's TANF/MOE requirement in a
reporting period, the commissioner shall
inform the chairs of the appropriate legislative
committees about all transfers made under
that authority for this purpose.
(g) If the commissioner determines that
nonfederal expenditures under paragraph
(a) are insufficient to meet TANF/MOE
expenditure requirements, and if the
legislature is not or will not be in session
to take timely action to avoid a federal
penalty, the commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures from other allowable
sources as TANF/MOE expenditures
after the requirements of this paragraph
are met. The commissioner may report
nonfederal expenditures in addition to those
specified under paragraph (a) as nonfederal
TANF/MOE expenditures, but only ten
days after the commissioner of finance
42ND DAY]                            MONDAY, APRIL 27, 2009   3411

has first submitted the commissioner's
recommendations for additional allowable
sources     of    nonfederal    TANF/MOE
expenditures to the members of the legislative
commission on planning and fiscal policy for
their review.
(h) The commissioner of finance shall not
incorporate any changes in federal TANF
expenditures or nonfederal expenditures for
TANF/MOE that may result from reporting
additional allowable sources of nonfederal
TANF/MOE expenditures under the interim
procedures in paragraph (g) into the February
or November forecasts required under
Minnesota Statutes, section 16A.103, unless
the commissioner of finance has approved
the additional sources of expenditures under
paragraph (g).
(i) Minnesota Statutes, section 256.011,
subdivision 3, which requires that federal
grants or aids secured or obtained under that
subdivision be used to reduce any direct
appropriations provided by law, do not apply
if the grants or aids are federal TANF funds.

work experience program as specified in section 256J.67, unpaid apprenticeships or internships,
and supported work when a wage subsidy is not provided. Unpaid work experience is only an

placing a participant in unpaid work, the county must inform the participant that the participant
will be notified if a paid work experience or supported work position becomes available. Unless
a participant consents in writing to participate in unpaid work experience, the participant's
employment plan may only include unpaid work experience if including the unpaid work
experience in the plan will meet the following criteria:
    (i) the unpaid work experience will provide the participant specific skills or experience that
cannot be obtained through other work activity options where the participant resides or is willing to
reside; and
   (ii) the skills or experience gained through the unpaid work experience will result in higher
wages for the participant than the participant could earn without the unpaid work experience;
   (4) job search including job readiness assistance, job clubs, job placement, job-related
counseling, and job retention services;
     (5) job readiness education, including English as a second language (ESL) or functional work
literacy classes as limited by the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 2, general educational
development (GED) course work, high school completion, and adult basic education as limited by
the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 1;
    (6) job skills training directly related to employment, including education and training that can
reasonably be expected to lead to employment, as limited by the provisions of section 256J.53;
   (7) providing child care services to a participant who is working in a community service program;
   (8) activities included in the employment plan that is developed under section 256J.521,
subdivision 3; and
    (9) preemployment activities including chemical and mental health assessments, treatment, and
services; learning disabilities services; child protective services; family stabilization services; or
other programs designed to enhance employability.
