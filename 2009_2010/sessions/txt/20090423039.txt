credited to the account.

used by the commissioner of transportation for operations and routine maintenance of the Stillwater

treasury without specific legislative authorization. Any money transferred from the trunk highway
fund may only be used for trunk highway purposes. For the purposes of this section:
   (1) "Income" is the amount of interest on debt securities and dividends on equity securities. Any
gains or losses from the sale of securities must be added to the principal of the account.
    (2) "Routine maintenance" means activities that are predictable and repetitive, but not activities
that would constitute major repairs or rehabilitation.
    (b) Investment management fees incurred by the State Board of Investment are eligible expenses
for reimbursement from the account.

in the account.

section.

    Subd. 5. Investment. The State Board of Investment, in consultation with the commissioner of
transportation, shall invest money in the account under section 11A.24.
    Subd. 6. Demolition. If the commissioner determines, in consultation with the State Historic
Preservation Office, that it is necessary to demolish the Stillwater lift bridge, the principal in the
account may be spent to pay for demolition of the bridge, and is appropriated to the commissioner
of transportation only for that purpose, except that only funds originally contributed by the state or
federal government can be used to pay for demolition. Any money remaining in the account after
demolition must be used to pay for the preservation of other historic bridges in consultation with
the State Historic Preservation Office.
   Subd. 7. Audits. The account is subject to audit by the legislative auditor.
    Subd. 8. Reports required. The commissioner of transportation shall report annually to the chair
and ranking minority member of each legislative committee with jurisdiction over transportation on
the endowment account. At a minimum, the report must include detailed revenue and expenditure
information."

    Senator Pogemiller moved that an urgency be declared within the meaning of Article IV, Section
19, of the Constitution of Minnesota, with respect to H.F. No. 2123 and that the rules of the Senate
be so far suspended as to give H.F. No. 2123 its second and third reading and place it on its final
passage. The motion prevailed.
   H.F. No. 2123 was read the second time.
   Senator Anderson moved to amend H.F. No. 2123 as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause, and delete the title, of H.F. No. 2123, and insert the
language after the enacting clause, and the title, of S.F. No. 2099, the second engrossment.
