   Sec. 2. [15C.02] LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN ACTS.
   (a) A person who commits any act described in clauses (1) to (8) is liable to the state for a civil
penalty of not less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000 per false or fraudulent claim, plus three
times the amount of damages that the state sustains because of the act of that person, except as
otherwise provided in paragraph (b):
    (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the state a false
or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
    (2) knowingly makes or uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a
false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the state;
    (3) knowingly conspires to either present a false or fraudulent claim to the state for payment or

or approval of a false or fraudulent claim;
    (4) has possession, custody, or control of public property or money used, or to be used, by the
state and knowingly delivers or causes to be delivered to the state less money or property than the
amount for which the person receives a receipt;
    (5) is authorized to prepare or deliver a receipt for money or property used, or to be used, by the
state and knowingly prepares or delivers a receipt that falsely represents the money or property;
    (6) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an obligation or debt, public property from an
officer or employee of the state who lawfully may not sell or pledge the property;
    (7) is a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim and, after discovering the falsity
of the claim, knowingly fails to disclose the falsity to the state within a reasonable time; or
   (8) knowingly makes or uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to conceal,
avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state.
   (b) The court may assess not less than two times the amount of damages that the state sustains
because of the act of the person if:
    (1) the person committing a violation under paragraph (a) furnished officials of the state
responsible for investigating the false or fraudulent claim violation with all information known to
the person about the violation within 30 days after the date on which the person first obtained the
information;
   (2) the person fully cooperated with any state investigation of the violation; and

    (3) at the time the person furnished the state with information about the violation, no criminal
prosecution, civil action, or administrative action had been commenced under this chapter with
respect to the violation and the person did not have actual knowledge of the existence of an
investigation into the violation.
    (c) A person violating this section is also liable to the state for the costs of a civil action brought
to recover any penalty or damages.
    (d) Except for conduct described in paragraph (a), clause (7), a person is not liable under this
section for mere inadvertence or mistake with respect to activities involving a false or fraudulent
claim.
   Sec. 3. [15C.03] EXCLUSION.
    This chapter does not apply to claims, records, or statements made under portions of Minnesota
Statutes relating to taxation.
   Sec. 4. [15C.04] RESPONSIBILITIES OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.
    The attorney general may investigate violations of section 15C.02. If the attorney general finds
that a person has violated or is violating section 15C.02, the attorney general may bring a civil action
under this section against the person to enjoin an act in violation of section 15C.02 and to recover
damages and penalties.
  Sec. 5. [15C.05] PRIVATE REMEDIES; COMPLAINT UNDER SEAL; COPY OF
COMPLAINT AND WRITTEN DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE TO BE SENT TO
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person may maintain an action under this
chapter on the person's own account and that of the state if money, property, or services provided by
the state are involved; the person's own account and that of a political subdivision if money, property,
or services provided by the political subdivision are involved; or on the person's own account and
that of both the state and a political subdivision if both are involved. After an action is commenced,
it may be voluntarily dismissed only if the court and the attorney general give written consent to the
dismissal and their reasons for consenting.
    (b) If an action is brought under this section, no other person may bring another action under
this section based on the same facts that are the subject of the pending action.
   (c) An action may not be maintained by a person under this section:
   (1) against the legislature, the judiciary, an executive department of the state, or a political
subdivision, and their members or employees;
    (2) if the action is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil action or
an administrative proceeding for a monetary penalty to which the state or a political subdivision of
the state is already a party; or
    (3) unless the action is brought by an original source of the information or the attorney general
initiates or intervenes in the action, if the action is based upon the public disclosure of allegations
or transactions: (i) in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; (ii) in an investigation, report,
hearing, or audit conducted by or at the request of the house of representatives or the senate; (iii) by
232                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [11TH DAY

an auditor or the governing body of a political subdivision; or (iv) by the news media.
    (d) A complaint in an action under this section must be commenced by filing the complaint with
the court in chambers and the court must place it under seal for at least 60 days. No service may be
made upon the defendant until the complaint is unsealed.
    (e) If a complaint is filed under this section, the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint on
the attorney general in accordance with the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure and at the same time
shall serve a written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the plaintiff
possesses.
  Sec. 6. [15C.06] ATTORNEY GENERAL INTERVENTION; MOTION TO EXTEND
TIME; UNSEALING OF COMPLAINT.
    (a) Within 60 days after receiving a complaint and disclosure under section 15C.05, the attorney
general shall intervene or decline intervention or, for good cause shown, move the court to extend
the time for doing so. The motion may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in chambers.
   (b) The complaint must be unsealed after the attorney general decides whether or not to intervene.
    (c) Notwithstanding the attorney general's decision regarding intervention in an action brought
by a plaintiff under section 15C.05, the attorney general may pursue the claim through any
alternate remedy available to the state, including an administrative proceeding to determine a civil
monetary penalty. If the attorney general pursues an alternate remedy in another proceeding, the
person initiating the action has the same rights in that proceeding as if the action had continued
under section 15C.05. A finding of fact or conclusion of law made in the other proceeding that
has become final is conclusive on all parties to an action under section 15C.05. For purposes of
this paragraph, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the
appropriate state court, if the time for filing an appeal has expired, or if the finding or conclusion
is not subject to judicial review.
  Sec. 7. [15C.07] SERVICE OF UNSEALED COMPLAINT AND RESPONSE BY
DEFENDANT.
    When unsealed, the complaint must be served on the defendant pursuant to Rule 3 of the
Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendant must respond to the complaint within 20 days
after it is served on the defendant.
   Sec. 8. [15C.08] ATTORNEY GENERAL AND PRIVATE PARTY ROLES.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, if the attorney general does not intervene at
the outset in an action brought by a person under section 15C.05, the person has the same rights in
conducting the action as the attorney general would have. A copy of each pleading or other paper
filed in the action and a copy of the transcript of each deposition taken must be mailed to the attorney
general if the attorney general so requests and pays the cost of doing so.
    (b) If the attorney general elects not to intervene at the outset of the action, the attorney general
may intervene subsequently, upon timely application and good cause shown. If the attorney general
so intervenes, the attorney general subsequently has primary responsibility for conducting the action.
   (c) If the attorney general elects at the outset of the action to intervene, the attorney general has
11TH DAY]                       THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2009                                         233

the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action. The person who initially brought the action
remains a party but the person's acts do not bind the attorney general.
     (d) Whether or not the attorney general intervenes in the action, the attorney general may move
to dismiss the action for good cause. The person who brought the action must be notified of the
filing of the motion and may oppose it and present evidence at the hearing. The attorney general
may also settle the action. If the attorney general intends to settle the action, the attorney general
shall notify the person who brought the action. The state may settle the action with the defendant
notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a
hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances.
Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing may be held in chambers.
   Sec. 9. [15C.09] STAY OF DISCOVERY; EXTENSION.
    (a) The court may stay discovery by a person who brought an action under section 15C.05 for
not more than 60 days if the attorney general shows that the proposed discovery would interfere with
the investigation or prosecution of a civil or criminal matter arising out of the same facts, whether
or not the attorney general participates in the action.
    (b) The court may extend the stay upon a further showing that the attorney general has pursued
the civil or criminal investigation or proceeding with reasonable diligence and that the proposed
discovery would interfere with its continuation. Discovery may not be stayed for a total of more
than six months over the objection of the person who brought the action, except for good cause
shown by the attorney general.
   (c) A showing made pursuant to this section must be made in chambers.
  Sec. 10. [15C.10] COURT-IMPOSED LIMITATION UPON PARTICIPATION OF
PRIVATE PLAINTIFF IN ACTION.
    Upon a showing by the attorney general in an action in which the attorney general has intervened
that unrestricted participation by a person under this chapter would interfere with or unduly delay
the conduct of the action, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or solely for harassment, the court may
limit the person's participation by limiting the number of witnesses, the length of the testimony of
the witnesses, the cross-examination of witnesses by the person, or by other measures.
   Sec. 11. [15C.11] LIMITATION OF ACTIONS; REMEDIES.
    (a) An action under this chapter may not be commenced more than three years after the date of
discovery of the fraudulent activity by the attorney general or more than six years after the fraudulent
activity occurred, whichever occurs later, but in no event more than ten years after the date on which
the violation is committed.
    (b) A finding of guilt in a criminal proceeding charging a false statement or fraud, whether upon
a verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, stops the person found guilty from denying
an essential element of that offense in an action under this chapter based upon the same transaction
as the criminal proceeding.
    (c) In an action under this chapter, the state and any plaintiff under section 15C.05 must prove the
essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence.
234                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [11TH DAY

   Sec. 12. [15C.12] AWARD OF EXPENSES AND ATTORNEY FEES.
    If the attorney general or a person who brought an action under section 15C.05 prevails in or
settles an action under this chapter, the court may authorize the person to recover reasonable costs,
reasonable attorney fees, and the reasonable fees of expert consultants and expert witnesses. These
expenses must be awarded against the defendant and are not allowed against the state or a political
subdivision. If the attorney general does not intervene in the action and the person bringing the
action conducts the action and the defendant prevails in the action, the court shall award to the
defendant reasonable expenses and attorney fees against the party or parties who participated in the
action if it finds that the action was clearly frivolous or vexatious or brought solely for harassment.
   Sec. 13. [15C.13] DISTRIBUTION TO PRIVATE PLAINTIFF IN CERTAIN ACTIONS.
    If the attorney general intervenes at the outset in an action brought by a person under section
15C.05, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or more than 25 percent of any
recovery in proportion to the person's contribution to the conduct of the action. If the attorney general
does not intervene in the action at any time, the person is entitled to receive not less than 25 percent
or more than 30 percent of any recovery of the civil penalty and damages, or settlement, as the court
determines is reasonable. If the attorney general does not intervene in the action at the outset but
subsequently intervenes, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or more than 30
percent of any recovery, as the court determines is reasonable based on the person's participation in
the action before the attorney general intervened.
   Sec. 14. [15C.14] EMPLOYER RESTRICTIONS; LIABILITY.
    (a) An employer must not adopt or enforce any rule or policy forbidding an employee to disclose
information to the state, a political subdivision, or a law enforcement agency, or to act in furtherance
of an action under this chapter, including investigation for, bringing, or testifying in the action.
    (b) An employer must not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, deny promotion to, or
otherwise discriminate against an employee in the terms or conditions of employment because of
lawful acts done by the employee on the employee's behalf or on behalf of others in disclosing
information to the state, a political subdivision, or a law enforcement agency in furtherance of an
action under this chapter, including investigation for bringing or testifying in the action.
    (c) An employer who violates this section is liable to the affected employee in a civil action for
damages and other relief, including reinstatement, twice the amount of lost compensation, interest
on the lost compensation, any special damage sustained as a result of the discrimination, and punitive
damages if appropriate. The employer is also liable for expenses recoverable under section 15C.12,
including costs and attorney fees."
