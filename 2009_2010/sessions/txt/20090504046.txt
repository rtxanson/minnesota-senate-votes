    Senator Cohen from the Committee on Finance, to which was referred
    H.F. No. 928: A bill for an act relating to transportation; modifying various provisions related to
transportation or public safety; prohibiting certain acts; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections
161.14, subdivision 62, as added, by adding subdivisions; 168.33, subdivision 2; 169.011, by adding
a subdivision; 169.045; 169.15; 169.306; 169.71, subdivision 1; 171.12, subdivision 6; 174.86,

law in Minnesota Statutes, chapters 160; 171; 174; 299C.
    Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
    Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 161.14, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 64. Granite City Crossing. The bridge over the Mississippi River on marked Trunk
Highway 23 in St. Cloud is designated "Granite City Crossing." The commissioner of transportation
shall adopt a suitable design to mark this bridge and erect appropriate signs, subject to section
161.139.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 165.14, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Prioritization of bridge projects. (a) The commissioner shall classify all bridges in
the program into tier 1, 2, or 3 bridges, where tier 1 is the highest tier. Unless the commissioner
identifies a reason for proceeding otherwise, before commencing bridge projects in a lower tier, all
bridge projects within a higher tier must to the extent feasible be selected and funded in the approved
state transportation improvement program, at any stage in the project development process, solicited
for bids, in contract negotiation, under construction, or completed.
    (b) The classification of each tier is as follows:
    (1) tier 1 consists of any bridge in the program that (i) has an average daily traffic count
that is above 1,000 and has a sufficiency rating that is at or below 50, or (ii) is identified by the
commissioner as a priority project;
    (2) tier 2 consists of any bridge that is not a tier 1 bridge, and (i) is classified as fracture-critical,
or (ii) has a sufficiency rating that is at or below 80; and
    (3) tier 3 consists of any other bridge in the program that is not a tier 1 or tier 2 bridge.
   (c) By June 30, 2018, all tier 1 and tier 2 bridges originally included in the program must be under
contract for repair or replacement with a new bridge that contains a load-path-redundant design,

except that a specific bridge may remain in continued service if the reasons are documented in the
report required under subdivision 5.
   (d) All bridge projects funded under this section in fiscal year 2010 or later must include bicycle
and pedestrian accommodations if both sides of the bridge are located in a city or the bridge links a
pedestrian way, shared-use path, trail, or scenic bikeway.
Bicycle and pedestrian accommodations would not be required if:
   (1) a comprehensive assessment demonstrates that there is an absence of need for bicycle and
pedestrian accommodations for the life of the bridge; or
    (2) there is a reasonable alternative bicycle and pedestrian crossing within one-quarter mile of
the bridge project.
All bicycle and pedestrian accommodations should enable a connection to any existing bicycle and
pedestrian infrastructure in close proximity to the bridge. All pedestrian facilities must meet or
exceed federal accessibility requirements as outlined in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, codified in United States Code, title 42, chapter 126, subchapter II, and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified in United States Code, title 29, section 794.
   (e) The commissioner shall establish criteria for determining the priority of bridge projects
within each tier, and must include safety considerations as a criterion.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 165.14, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Statewide transportation planning report. In conjunction with each update to the
Minnesota statewide transportation plan, or at least every six years, the commissioner shall submit
a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the house of representatives and senate
committees with jurisdiction over transportation finance. The report must include:
   (1) an explanation of the criteria and decision-making processes used to prioritize bridge
projects;
    (2) a historical and projected analysis of the extent to which all trunk highway bridges meet
bridge performance targets and comply with the accessibility requirements of Title II of the
Americans with Disabilities Act;
    (3) a summary of bridge projects (i) completed in the previous six years or since the last update
to the Minnesota statewide transportation plan, and (ii) currently in progress under the program;
    (4) a summary of bridge projects scheduled in the next four fiscal years and included in the state
transportation improvement program;
   (5) a projection of annual needs over the next 20 years;
    (6) a calculation of funding necessary to meet the completion date under subdivision 4, paragraph
(c), compared to the total amount of bridge-related funding available; and
    (7) for any tier 1 fracture-critical bridge that is repaired but not replaced, an explanation of the
reasons for repair instead of replacement.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 168.33, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

    Subd. 2. Deputy registrars. (a) The commissioner may appoint, and for cause discontinue, a
deputy registrar for any statutory or home rule charter city as the public interest and convenience
may require, without regard to whether the county auditor of the county in which the city is situated
has been appointed as the deputy registrar for the county or has been discontinued as the deputy
registrar for the county, and without regard to whether the county in which the city is situated has
established a county license bureau that issues motor vehicle licenses as provided in section 373.32.
    (b) The commissioner may appoint, and for cause discontinue, a deputy registrar for any statutory
or home rule charter city as the public interest and convenience may require, if the auditor for the
county in which the city is situated chooses not to accept appointment as the deputy registrar for the
county or is discontinued as a deputy registrar, or if the county in which the city is situated has not
established a county license bureau that issues motor vehicle licenses as provided in section 373.32.
The individual appointed by the commissioner as a deputy registrar for any statutory or home rule
charter city must be a resident of the county in which the city is situated.
    (c) The commissioner may appoint, and for cause discontinue, the county auditor of each county
as a deputy registrar.
    (d) Despite any other provision, a person other than a county auditor or a director of a county
license bureau, who was appointed by the registrar before August 1, 1976, as a deputy registrar
for any statutory or home rule charter city, may continue to serve as deputy registrar and may be
discontinued for cause only by the commissioner. The county auditor who appointed the deputy
registrars is responsible for the acts of deputy registrars appointed by the auditor.
    (e) Each deputy, before entering upon the discharge of duties, shall take and subscribe an oath
to faithfully discharge the duties and to uphold the laws of the state.
    (f) If a deputy registrar appointed under this subdivision is not an officer or employee of a county
or statutory or home rule charter city, the deputy shall in addition give bond to the state in the sum
of $10,000, or a larger sum as may be required by the commissioner, conditioned upon the faithful
discharge of duties as deputy registrar.

greenhouse gas emissions;
   (4) coordinate the department's activities wherever appropriate with the activities of other
governmental agencies;
    (5) use technology where appropriate to increase agency productivity, improve customer service,
increase public access to information about government, and increase public participation in the
business of government;

    Subd. 1b. Statewide freight and passenger rail plan. (a) The commissioner shall develop a
comprehensive statewide freight and passenger rail plan to be included and revised as a part of
the statewide transportation plan. The plan must include a study on the feasibility of establishing
commuter transit service in: the Little Crow Transit Way, along or near marked Trunk Highway
12 between Willmar and downtown Minneapolis, and the Sioux Trail Transit Way, along or near
marked Trunk Highway 13 between Shakopee and St. Paul.
    (b) Before the initial version of the plan is adopted, the commissioner shall provide a
copy for review and comment to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and
house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation policy and finance.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the commissioner may adopt the next revision of the statewide
transportation plan, scheduled to be completed in calendar year 2009, prior to completion of the
initial version of the comprehensive statewide freight and passenger rail plan.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 33. [174.285] MINNESOTA COUNCIL ON TRANSPORTATION ACCESS.
    Subdivision 1. Council established. A Minnesota Council on Transportation Access is
established to study, evaluate, oversee, and make recommendations to improve the coordination,
availability, accessibility, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and safety of transportation services
provided to the transit public. "Transit public" means those persons who utilize public transit and
those who, because of mental or physical disability, income status, or age are unable to transport
themselves and are dependent upon others for transportation services.
   Subd. 2. Duties of council. In order to accomplish the purposes in subdivision 1, the council
shall adopt a biennial work plan that must incorporate the following activities:
    (1) compile information on existing transportation alternatives for the transit public, and serve as
a clearinghouse for information on services, funding sources, innovations, and coordination efforts;
    (2) identify best practices and strategies that have been successful in Minnesota and in other
states for coordination of local, regional, state, and federal funding and services;
   (3) establish statewide objectives for providing public transportation services for the transit
public;
   (4) identify barriers prohibiting coordination and accessibility of public transportation services
and aggressively pursue the elimination of those barriers;
   (5) develop and implement policies and procedures for coordinating local, regional, state, and
federal funding and services for the transit public;
   (6) identify stakeholders in providing services for the transit public, and seek input from them
concerning barriers and appropriate strategies;
   (7) establish guidelines for developing transportation coordination plans throughout the state;
   (8) encourage all state agencies participating in the council to purchase trips within the
coordinated system;
   (9) facilitate the creation and operation of transportation brokerages to match riders to

pursuant to a contract under this section. An individual who is detained, committed, or placed on an
involuntary basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined or treated in Minnesota
pursuant to a contract under this section. A peace or health officer who is acting under the authority
of the sending state may transport an individual to a receiving agency that provides services pursuant
to a contract under this section and may transport the individual back to the sending state under the
laws of the sending state. Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are granted recognition

the courts of the receiving state. Individuals who are detained, committed, or placed under the law
of a sending state and who are transferred to a receiving state under this section continue to be in

in emergencies, those individuals may not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a receiving
agency without the specific approval of the authority responsible for them under the law of the
sending state.

subject to the sending state's laws and rules relating to length of confinement, reexaminations, and
extensions of confinement. No individual may be sent to another state pursuant to a contract under
this section until the receiving state has enacted a law recognizing the validity and applicability of
this section.
    (c) If an individual receiving services pursuant to a contract under this section leaves the
receiving agency without permission and the individual is subject to involuntary confinement
under the law of the sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to return
the individual to the receiving agency. The receiving agency shall immediately report the absence
to the sending agency. The receiving state has the primary responsibility for, and the authority to

ballot for one or more elections if that request is received by the county auditor or municipal clerk
at least five days before the deadline in section 204B.35 for delivering ballots for the election to
which it applies. Sixty days before each state primary, the county auditor must send each voter
with ongoing absentee ballot status a nonforwardable postcard to notify the voter when the voter
can expect to receive the ballots. Each applicant must automatically be provided with an absentee

   (b) Ongoing absentee voter status ends on:
   (1) the voter's written request;
   (2) the voter's death;
   (3) return of an ongoing absentee ballot as undeliverable;
   (4) a change in the voter's status so that the voter is not eligible to vote under section 201.15 or

absentee balloting process and an updated ongoing absentee voter application to every voter with
ongoing absentee ballot status in their county. A voter must return the application to maintain the
voter's status as an ongoing absentee voter. Upon receipt of a completed application, the county
auditor shall scan an image of the application and update the voter's record with any new or changed
information.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the statewide voter registration system has been tested and shown to properly allow for the issuance
of ballots to ongoing absentee voters.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.05, is amended to read:
  203B.05 DESIGNATION OF MUNICIPAL CLERKS TO ADMINISTER EARLY AND

them.
    A clerk may only administer the provisions of sections 203B.04 to 203B.15 and 203B.30 to
203B.35, if the clerk has the technical capacity to access the absentee ballot module of the statewide
voter registration system in the secure manner prescribed by the secretary of state. The secretary of
state must identify hardware, software, security, or other technical prerequisites necessary to ensure
the security, access controls, and performance of the statewide voter registration system. A clerk
designated under this subdivision must receive training approved by the secretary of state on the
use of the statewide voter registration system. A clerk may not use the statewide voter registration
system until the clerk has received the required training.

not held on the same day as a statewide election, applications for absentee ballots shall be filed
with the city, school district, or town clerk and the duties prescribed by this chapter for the county
auditor shall be performed by the city, school district, or town clerk unless the county auditor agrees
to perform those duties on behalf of the city, school district, or town clerk. The costs incurred to
provide absentee ballots and perform the duties prescribed by this subdivision shall be paid by the

    Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.06, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Delivery of ballots. (a) If an application for absentee ballots is accepted at a time
when absentee ballots are not yet available for distribution, the county auditor, or municipal clerk
accepting the application shall file it and as soon as absentee ballots are available for distribution
shall mail them to the address specified in the application. If an application for absentee ballots is
accepted when absentee ballots are available for distribution, the county auditor or municipal clerk
accepting the application shall promptly:
   (1) mail the ballots to the voter whose signature appears on the application if the application is
submitted by mail and does not request commercial shipping under clause (2);
   (2) ship the ballots to the voter using a commercial shipper requested by the voter at the voter's
expense;
    (3) deliver the absentee ballots directly to the voter if the application is submitted in person; or
   (4) deliver the absentee ballots in a sealed transmittal envelope to an agent who has been

    (b) If an application does not indicate the election for which absentee ballots are sought, the
county auditor or municipal clerk shall mail or deliver only the ballots for the next election occurring
after receipt of the application. Only one set of ballots may be mailed, shipped, or delivered to an
applicant for any election, except as provided in section ­   20
                                                               ­3

    Upon accepting an application for a state primary or state general election, the county auditor
or municipal clerk shall record in the statewide registration system the voter's name, address of
residence in Minnesota, mailing address, Minnesota driver's license or state identification number,
or the last four digits of the voter's Social Security number, if provided by the voter, that an absentee
ballot has been transmitted to the voter, the method of transmission, and the date of transmission.
    Upon receipt of a returned absentee ballot for a state primary or state general election, the county
auditor or municipal clerk shall record in the statewide voter registration system that the voter has
returned the ballot.
    Upon receipt of notice that the ballot board has accepted or rejected the absentee ballot for a state
primary or state general election, the county auditor or municipal clerk shall record in the statewide
voter registration system whether the ballot was accepted or rejected, and if rejected, the reason for
rejection. If a replacement ballot is transmitted to the voter, the county auditor or municipal clerk
shall record this in the statewide voter registration system.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the statewide voter registration system has been tested, shown to properly allow municipal clerks to
update absentee voting records, and shown to be able to handle the expected volume of use.

The return envelope must be designed in one of the following ways:
    (1) it must be of sufficient size to contain an additional envelope that when sealed, conceals the
signature, identification, and other information; or
   (2) it must provide an additional flap that when sealed, conceals the signature, identification, and
other information.
    Election officials may open the flap or the additional envelope at any time after receiving the
returned ballot to inspect the returned certificate for completeness or to ascertain other information.
    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Eligibility certificate. A certificate of eligibility to vote by absentee ballot shall
be printed on the back of the return envelope. The certificate shall contain space for the voter's
Minnesota driver's license, state identification number, or the last four digits of the voter's Social
Security number or to indicate that they do not have one, and a statement to be signed and sworn
by the voter indicating that the voter meets all of the requirements established by law for voting
by absentee ballot, that the ballots were unmarked when received by the voter, and that the
voter personally marked the ballots without showing how they were marked, or, if the voter was
physically unable to mark them, that the voter directed another individual to mark them. If the
voter was not previously registered at that address, the certificate shall also contain space for a
statement signed by a person who is ­          r­

the Web site has been tested and shown to properly retrieve information from the correct voter's
record, and can handle the expected volume of use.

    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.081, is amended to read:
    203B.081 LOCATIONS FOR ABSENTEE VOTING IN PERSON.
    An eligible voter may vote by absentee ballot during the 30 days before the election up until
the fourth day before the election in the office of the county auditor and at any other polling place
designated by the county auditor. On the day before the election, voters who had planned on voting
in person in the polling place and only learned of circumstances in the last four days that will prevent
them from doing so may vote by absentee ballot. The county auditor shall make such designations
at least 90 days before the election. At least one voting booth in each polling place must be made
available by the county auditor for this purpose. The county auditor must also make available at
least one electronic ballot marker in each polling place that has implemented a voting system that
is accessible for individuals with disabilities pursuant to section 206.57, subdivision 5.
    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.085, is amended to read:
  203B.085 COUNTY AUDITOR'S AND MUNICIPAL CLERK'S OFFICES TO REMAIN
OPEN DURING CERTAIN HOURS PRECEDING ELECTION.
    The county auditor's office in each county and the clerk's office in each city or town authorized
under section 203B.05 to administer absentee balloting must be open for acceptance of absentee
ballot applications and casting of absentee ballots from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday and
until 5:00 p.m. on the fourth day ­m

that day falls on a Saturday or Sunday. On the day before the election, the office must be open for
acceptance of absentee ballot applications and to allow a voter to cast an absentee ballot if the voter
provides additional certification stating that the voter had planned on voting in person at the polling
place but became aware of circumstances within the four days preceding the day before the election
that prevent the voter from voting in person at the polling place. Town clerks' offices must be open
for absentee voting from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on the Saturday before a town general election
held in March. The school district clerk, when performing the county auditor's election duties, need
not comply with this section.
    Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Generally. Each full-time municipal clerk or school district clerk who has
authority under section 203B.05 to administer absentee and early voting laws shall designate

also designate election judges to perform the duties in this section. A ballot may be delivered only
to an eligible voter who is a temporary or permanent resident or patient in a health care facility or
hospital located in the municipality in which the voter maintains residence. The ballots shall be
delivered by two election judges, each of whom is affiliated with a different major political party.
When the election judges deliver or return ballots as provided in this section, they shall travel
together in the same vehicle. The election judges must bring a ballot box. Both election judges
shall be present when an applicant ­      co

in charge of the election need not write "Replacement" on the replacement ballot.
    If the ballot is rejected within five days before the election, the envelope must remain sealed and
the official in charge of the ballot board must attempt to contact the voter by telephone or e-mail
to notify the voter that the voter's ballot has been rejected. The official must document the attempts
made to contact the voter.

       Subd. 4a. Storage and counting of ballots. The ballot board must:
   (1) remove the ballots from the ballot box and seal and secure them at the end of each day on
which absentee ballots were inserted into the ballot box;
    (2) without inspecting the ballots, ensure that the number of ballots removed from the ballot box
is equal to the number of absentee ballots accepted that day;
    (3) before 9:00 a.m. on election day, mark the rosters or provide to the precinct a supplemental
report of voters whose absentee ballot was accepted after the polling place rosters were generated;
and
   (4) verify that voters whose absentee ballots arrived after the rosters were marked or the
supplemental report was generated have not voted in person, before opening, duplicating as needed,
and inserting these ballots into the ballot box.
    After the polls have closed, the ballot board must count the ballots, tabulating the vote in a
manner that indicates each vote of the voter and the total votes cast for each candidate or question.
In state primary and state general elections, the results must indicate the total votes cast for each
candidate or question in each precinct and report the vote totals tabulated for each precinct. The
count is public. No vote totals from ballots may be made public before the close of voting on election
day.
    In state primary and state general elections, these vote totals must be added to the vote totals
on the summary statements of the returns for the appropriate precinct. In other elections, these vote
totals may be added to the vote totals on the summary statement of returns for the appropriate
precinct or may be reported as a separate total.
    If the task has not been completed previously, members of the ballot board must verify within
48 hours after election day that voters whose absentee ballots arrived after the rosters were marked
or supplemental reports were generated and whose ballots were accepted did not vote in person on
election day, before the members of the ballot board open the ballot envelopes, duplicate the ballots
as needed, insert the ballots into the ballot box, count the ballots, and add the votes from these totals
to the votes from the appropriate precincts.

election, a vote for a political party without specifying the name of a candidate must not be counted.
    Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.23, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Duties. The absentee ballot board must examine all returned absentee ballot envelopes
for ballots issued under sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 and accept or reject the absentee ballots in the
manner provided in section 203B.24. If the certificate of voter eligibility is not printed on the return
or administrative envelope, the certificate must be attached to the ballot secrecy envelope.
    The absentee ballot board must immediately examine the return envelopes and mark them
"accepted" or "rejected" during the 30 days before the election. If an envelope has been rejected at
least five days before the election, the ballots in the envelope must be considered spoiled ballots
and the official in charge of the absentee ballot board must provide the voter with a replacement
absentee ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot.
   Except for federal write-in absentee ballots, the ballots from return envelopes marked
"Accepted" must be opened, duplicated as needed in the manner provided by section 206.86,
subdivision 5, initialed by the members of the ballot board, and deposited in the appropriate ballot
box.
    Federal write-in absentee ballots marked "Accepted" must be opened, duplicated as needed in
the manner provided by section 206.86, subdivision 5, initialed by the members of the ballot board,
and deposited in the appropriate ballot box after 5:00 p.m. on the fourth day before the election,
unless the voter has submitted another absentee ballot with a later postmark that has been accepted
by the board.
   In all other respects, the provisions of the Minnesota Election Law governing deposit and
counting of ballots apply.
   No vote totals from absentee ballots may be made public before the close of voting on election
day.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the statewide voter registration system has been tested, shown to properly allow municipal clerks to
update absentee voting records, and shown to be able to handle the expected volume of use.

     Subdivision 1. Voting procedure. Each voter shall sign an early voting roster that must include
the certification provided in section 204C.10. An individual who is not registered to vote must
register in the manner provided in section 201.061, subdivision 3. After the voter has signed a roster,
two staff of the county auditor or municipal clerk or two election judges must initial the appropriate
ballot for the voter's precinct and provide it to the voter. The voter must mark the ballot and deposit
it in either a precinct voting system or a sealed ballot box. A voter may not leave the polling place
with the ballot.
    Subd. 2. Record of voting. (a) The county auditor or municipal clerk must immediately record
that a voter has voted early on the voter's record in the statewide voter registration system. After
a voter's record has been marked to record that an individual has voted early, the individual must
not be allowed to vote again at that election. Voters who are not preregistered at the voter's current
address must be considered election day registrants.
    (b) The early voting rosters must be marked no later than the start of voting on election day to
indicate the voters who have cast a ballot at an early voting location. The rosters may be marked
either:
    (1) by the municipal clerk before election day;
    (2) by the absentee ballot board before election day; or
    (3) by the election judges at the polling place on election day.
    (c) A voter who has cast a ballot in person by early voting and deposited it in a ballot box or
ballot counter must not be permitted to vote at the polling place on election day. An absentee ballot
received from a voter who has cast a ballot in person by early voting must be rejected by the election
judges.
   Subd. 3. Storage and counting of ballots. Two staff of the county auditor or municipal clerk or
two election judges of different major political parties must:
   (1) remove the ballots from the ballot box and seal and secure them at the end of each day on
which early ballots were inserted into the ballot box; and
    (2) without inspecting the ballots, ensure that the number of ballots removed from the ballot box
is equal to the number of voters who voted early.
    After the polls have closed on election day, two staff of the county auditor or two election judges
of different major political parties must count the early ballots, tabulating the vote in a manner that
indicates each vote of the voter and the total votes cast for each candidate or question. In state
primary and state general elections, the results must indicate the total votes cast for each candidate
or question in each precinct and report the vote totals tabulated for each precinct. The count is public.
No vote totals from early ballots may be made public before the close of voting on election day.
    Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204B.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Candidates seeking nomination by primary. No individual who seeks nomination for
any partisan or nonpartisan office at a primary shall be nominated for the same office by nominating

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204B.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1b. Address and telephone number. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d), an affidavit
of candidacy must state the candidate's residence address and a telephone number where the
candidate can be contacted. The form for the affidavit of candidacy and for the separate affidavit
required under paragraph (c) must allow the candidate to specify that the candidate's address must
be classified as private data.
     (b) For an office whose residency requirement must be satisfied by the close of the filing period,
a registered voter in this state may request in writing that the filing officer receiving the affidavit of
candidacy review the address as provided in this paragraph, at any time up to one day after the last
day for filing for office. If requested, the filing officer must determine whether the address provided
in the affidavit of candidacy is within the area represented by the office the candidate is seeking.
If the filing officer determines that the address is not within the area represented by the office, the
filing officer must immediately notify the candidate and the candidate's name must be removed from
the ballot for that office. A determination made by a filing officer under this paragraph is subject to
judicial review under section 204B.44.
    (c) For an office whose residency requirement may be satisfied as of a date after filings close, a
candidate who does not reside in the district at the time of filing must submit a separate affidavit
stating the candidate's residence address and a telephone number where the candidate can be
contacted. The affidavit must be submitted to the filing officer by the deadline for meeting the
residency requirement.
    (d) If the candidate specifies under paragraph (a) of this subdivision that the candidate's residence
address is to be classified as private data, the candidate shall instead list the residence address on
a separate sheet to be attached to the affidavit of candidacy and that may be reviewed by the filing
officer as provided in this subdivision, but the residence address is otherwise classified as private
data.
    (e) The requirements of this subdivision do not apply to affidavits of candidacy for a candidate
for: (1) judicial office; (2) the office of county attorney; or (3) county sheriff.
    Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204B.07, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Form of petition. A nominating petition may consist of one or more separate
pages each of which shall state:
    (a) the office sought;
    (b) the candidate's name and residence address, including street and number if any; and

     (c) the candidate's political party or political principle expressed in not more than three words.
No candidate who files for a partisan office by nominating petition shall use the term "nonpartisan"
as a statement of political principle or the name of the candidate's political party. No part of the name
of a major political party may be used to designate the political party or principle of a candidate who
files for a partisan office by nominating petition, except that the word "independent" may be used
to designate the party or principle. A            ­­ ­­

    Two election judges of different major political parties may open the ballot box as needed to
straighten the ballots or remove voted ballots to prevent the box from becoming full. The election
judges shall not count or inspect the ballots.
    If the election judges remove any ballots from the box, the election judges shall put the ballots
into containers and seal them. The judges shall put any ballots taken from the ballot box's write-in
compartment into containers separate from the other ballots and seal them. The judges shall label
the ballot containers and secure them.
   The judges shall note on the incident report that the ballot box was opened, the time the box was
opened, and, if any ballots were removed, the number of any seals used to seal the ballot containers.

maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the statewide voter registration system has been tested, shown to properly allow municipal clerks to
update absentee voting records, and shown to be able to handle the expected volume of use.

     Sec. 102. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204C.17, is amended to read:
     204C.17 VOTING; SECRECY.
    Except as authorized by section 204C.15, a voter shall not reveal to anyone in the polling place
the name of any candidate for whom the voter intends to vote or has voted. A voter shall not ask
for or receive assistance in the marking of a ballot from anyone within the polling place except
as authorized by section 204C.15. If a voter, after marking a ballot, shows it to anyone except as
authorized by law or takes a picture of the voter's ballot, the election judges shall refuse to deposit
the ballot in any ballot box and shall place it among the spoiled ballots. Unless the showing of the
ballot was clearly intentional, the voter shall receive another ballot as provided in section 204C.13,

     Sec. 103. [204C.185] DUTIES OF ELECTION JUDGES.
    Subdivision 1. Damaged or defective ballots. If a ballot is damaged or defective so that it cannot
be counted properly by the automatic tabulating equipment, a true duplicate copy must be made of
the damaged ballot in the presence of two judges not of the same major political party and must be
substituted for the damaged ballot. Likewise, a duplicate ballot must be made of a defective ballot,
which may not include the votes for the offices for which it is defective. Duplicate ballots must be
clearly labeled "duplicate," indicate the precinct in which the corresponding damaged or defective
ballot was cast, bear a serial number which must be recorded on the damaged or defective ballot,
and be counted in lieu of the damaged or defective ballot.
    Subd. 2. Rejected ballots. Whenever a ballot created by an electronic ballot marker certified
by the secretary of state is rejected by an optical scan voting system, two election judges who are
members of different major political parties shall transcribe the votes on the ballot rejected by the

to ascertain that all are properly marked with the initials of the election judges. If any ballots are
not properly marked with the initials of the election judges, the election judges shall preserve but
not count them; however, if the number of ballots does not exceed the number to be counted, the
absence of either or both sets of initials of the election judges does not, by itself, disqualify the
vote from being counted and must not be the basis of a challenge in a recount. If there is still an
excess of properly marked ballots, the election judges shall replace them in the box, and one election
judge, without looking, shall withdraw from the box a number of ballots equal to the excess. The
withdrawn ballots shall not be counted but shall be preserved as provided in subdivision 4.
      Sec. 107. [204C.205] COUNTING BALLOTS.
    In precincts in which automatic tabulating equipment is located in the polling place, as soon
as the polls are closed the election judges shall secure the voting systems against further voting. A
tabulation of ballots must be obtained from the automatic tabulating equipment after all damaged
or defective ballots have been replaced. The tabulation, together with the returns of write-in and
absentee votes and the precinct summary statements prepared in accordance with section 204C.24,
constitute the official return of each precinct. Upon completion of the count, the returns are open to
the public.

   Sec. 108. [204C.206] COUNTING BALLOTS CENTRALLY.
    Subdivision 1. At the voting location. In precincts in which automatic tabulating equipment
is located in a central location, as soon as the polls are closed the election judges shall secure the
voting systems against further voting. They shall then open the ballot box and count the number of
ballots that have been cast to determine that the number of ballots does not exceed the number of
voters shown on the election register. If there is an excess, the judges shall seal the ballots in a ballot
container and transport the container to the county auditor or municipal clerk, who shall process the
ballots in the same manner as required in section 204C.20, subdivision 2, then enter the ballots into
the ballot counter. The total numbers of voters must be entered on the forms provided.
    Subd. 2. Transportation of ballots. The judges shall place all voted ballots, defective ballots,
and damaged ballots in the container provided for transporting them to the counting center. The
container must be sealed and delivered immediately to the counting center by two judges who are
not of the same major political party. The judges shall also deliver to the counting center, in a suitable
container, the unused ballots, and the spoiled ballot envelope.
    Subd. 3. Counting centers open; security. Proceedings at the counting center are open to the
public. They are under the direction of the official in charge of elections in each municipality and
must be under the observation of at last two election judges who are not of the same major political
party. Only persons employed and authorized for the purpose may touch any ballot, ballot container,
or statement of absentee ballot results.
    Subd. 4. Preliminary tabulation. When the ballots arrive at a counting center where votes are
counted by automatic tabulating equipment that is programmed to tabulate the votes from multiple
precincts, the ballots must be given to the counting center election judges and counted by the
automatic tabulating equipment. The results of this preliminary tabulation may be made available
to the public if the tabulation is clearly identified as unofficial.
   After any preliminary tabulation has been made, any ballots that could not be read by the
tabulator, or would not go through the tabulator, must be returned to the counting center election
judges who shall prepare replacements, if necessary, as provided in section 204C.185.
   Subd. 5. Final tabulation. A final tabulation of ballots must be obtained from the automatic
tabulating equipment after all damaged or defective ballots have been replaced. The final tabulation,
together with the returns of write-in and absentee votes and the precinct summary statements
prepared in accordance with section 204C.24, constitute the official return of each precinct. Upon
completion of the count the returns are open to the public.
   Sec. 109. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204C.21, is amended to read:
   204C.21 HAND COUNTING BALLOTS; PILING SYSTEM.
    Subdivision 1. General. Ballots that are counted by hand shall be counted as prescribed by this
section.
    Subd. 1a. Method. The election judges shall remove all the ballots from the box. Without
considering how the ballots are marked, the election judges shall ascertain that each ballot is
separate and shall count them to determine whether the number of ballots in the box corresponds
with the number of ballots to be counted. If two or more ballots are found folded together like
a single ballot, the election judges shall lay them aside until all the ballots in the box have been

were cast by one voter, the election judges shall preserve but not count them. The election judges

beginning with the first office or question on the ballot. They shall make one pile of the ballots for
each candidate who received votes for that office, or one pile for the "Yes" votes and one pile for
the "No" votes on a question. They shall make a pile of totally defective ballots and a pile of totally
blank ballots. They shall make a pile of ballots that are not totally defective but are defective with
respect to the office or question being counted and a pile of ballots that are not totally blank but
are blank with respect to the office or question being counted. After the separation into piles, the
election judges shall examine each pile and remove and place in the proper pile any ballots that
are found in the wrong pile. The election judges shall count the totally blank and totally defective
ballots and set them aside until the counting is over for that ballot. The election judges m ­­
                                                                                              ay­ must
pile ballots crosswise in groups of 25 in the same pile to facilitate counting. When their counts
agree, the election judges shall announce the number of ballots in each pile, and shall write the
number in the proper place on the summary statements.
    The election judges shall then return all the counted ballots, and all the partially defective or
partially blank ballots, to the original pile to be separated and counted in the same manner for the
next office or question.
    Subd. 2. More than one candidate to be elected; piling. Where more than one candidate is
to be elected to an office, the votes for that office shall be counted and canvassed in the manner
provided in subdivision ­1 1a as far as practicable.
    Subd. 2a. Defective ballots. A ballot that is defective to the extent that the election judges are
unable to determine the voter's intent shall be marked on the back "Defective" if it is totally defective
or "Defective as to ......," naming the office or question if it is defective only in part.
   Subd. 3. Primary. At a primary the election judges shall first separate the ­   p­

    (b
     ­­) Within 15 days after the close of filing, each municipal clerk or county auditor whose
governing body has decided in accordance with section 204D.08, subdivision 4, not to conduct the
state primary shall post notice that the offices have been so omitted and the state primary canceled
and shall send a copy of the notice to the secretary of state.
      Sec. 135. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204D.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Instructions to printer; printer's bond. (a) The official charged with the preparation
and distribution of the ballots shall prepare instructions to the printer for rotation of the names of
candidates and for layout of the ballot.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), the instructions shall be approved by the legal advisor
of the official before delivery to the printer.
    (c) The legal advisor of a town official is not required to approve instructions regarding the
rotation of the names of candidates on the ballot or the layout of the ballot.
    (d) Before a contract exceeding $1,000 is awarded for printing ballots, the printer shall furnish,
if requested by the official, a sufficient bond, letter of credit, or certified check, acceptable to the
official responsible for printing the ballots, conditioned on printing the ballots in conformity with
the Minnesota Election Law and the instructions delivered. The official responsible for printing the
ballots shall set the amount of the bond, letter of credit, or certified check in an amount equal to the
value of the purchase.
      Sec. 136. [204D.045] BALLOTS; FORM.
    Subdivision 1. Type. All ballots must be printed with black ink on white paper of sufficient
thickness to prevent the printing from being discernible from the back, except that marks not to be
read by the automatic tabulating equipment may be printed in another color ink. All ballots must
be printed in easily readable type with suitable lines dividing candidates, offices, instructions, and
other matter printed on ballots.
    Subd. 2. Titles. On the top of all ballots must be printed the words "Official Ballot," the date of
the election, and lines for the initials of at least two election judges. The instructions must read:
"To vote, completely fill in the oval(s) next to your choice(s) like this:" with the picture of a
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                         3677

completed oval; or "To vote, complete the arrow(s) pointing to your choice(s) like this:" with the
picture of a completed arrow. Additional instructions must include the following statement: "If you
make a mistake, ask for a new ballot." Directly underneath the official title of each office must be
printed the words "Vote for one" or "Vote for up to ..." (any greater number to be elected).
     Subd. 3. Candidates and offices. The name of each candidate must be printed at a right angle to
the length of the ballot. The name of each candidate must be printed in upper and lower case letters.
Candidates' names may be set in as large type as the length of the majority of names on the ballot
permits. The remaining candidates' names may be set in smaller sizes of type as the length of each
name requires, in order to fit the available space on the ballot. At a general election, the name of the
political party or the political principle of each candidate for partisan office must be printed below
the name of the candidate. The name of a political party or a political principle must be printed in
capital and lowercase letters of the same type. At a general election, blank lines containing the words
"write-in, if any" must be printed below the name of the last candidate for each office, or below the
title of the office if no candidate has filed for that office, so that a voter may write in the names of
individuals whose names are not on the ballot. One blank line must be printed for each officer of
that kind to be elected. At a primary, no blank lines may be provided for writing in the names of
individuals whose names do not appear on the primary ballot.
     In a column, and on a line with the names of the candidates and the blank lines, there must be
placed ovals or arrows, each oval or arrow to be of the same size, located as close as possible to the
name of the candidate or the words yes or no, in which the voter may designate a vote by completely
filling in the oval or connecting the arrow.
    Subd. 4. Question; form of ballot. When a question is to be submitted to a vote, a concise
statement of the nature of the question must be printed on the ballot. The words, "Yes" and "No"
must be printed, with an oval or arrow next to each word so that the voter may indicate either a
negative or affirmative vote.
    Subd. 5. Judicial candidates. The official ballot must contain the names of all candidates for
each judicial office and must state the number of those candidates for whom a voter may vote. Each
seat for an associate justice, associate judge, or judge of the district court must be numbered.
The words "Supreme Court," "Court of Appeals," and "(number) District Court" must be printed
above the respective judicial office groups on the ballot. The title of each judicial office must be
printed on the official primary and general election ballot as follows:
(a) In the case of the Supreme Court:
"Chief Justice";
"Associate Justice (number)";
(b) In the case of the Court of Appeals:
"Judge (number)"; or
(c) In the case of the District Court:
"Judge (number)."
   Subd. 6. Designation of incumbent; judicial offices. If a chief justice, associate justice, or judge

is a candidate to succeed again, the word "Incumbent" must be printed after or below that judge's
name as a candidate.
    Sec. 137. [204D.046] NAMES ON BALLOTS; IDENTICAL DESCRIPTIVE WORDS.
    When the similarity of surnames of two or more candidates for the same office at the same
election may cause confusion to voters because the candidates also have similar first names, up to
three additional words may be printed on the ballot after each surname to indicate the candidate's
occupation, office, residence, or any combination of them if the candidate furnishes the identifying
words to the filing officer by the last day for withdrawal of candidacy.
    Sec. 138. [204D.047] SUBSTITUTE BALLOTS.
   If a sufficient number of official ballots are not delivered or if the official ballots are stolen or
destroyed and a sufficient number of official ballots cannot be procured, the official in charge of
preparing the official ballots shall prepare substitute ballots in the form prescribed by this section.
The substitute ballots must be prepared in the same form as official ballots as far as practicable.
The word "Substitute" must be printed in brackets immediately above the words "Official Ballot."
When the substitute ballots are delivered to the municipal clerks or election judges they must be
accompanied by an initialed affidavit of the officer preparing them. The affidavit must state that the
substitute ballots have been prepared and furnished in the manner prescribed by this section and
must state the reason why sufficient official ballots were not ready for delivery. The election judges
shall include this affidavit with the election returns from that precinct.
    Sec. 139. [204D.048] PAPER COLOR FOR SAMPLE BALLOTS; PENALTY.
   No sample ballot may be printed on white paper except when appearing in a newspaper as news
matter. A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.
    Sec. 140. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204D.05, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. County auditor to prepare. The county auditor of each county shall prepare the state

     Sec. 142. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204D.08, is amended to read:
     204D.08 STATE PRIMARY BALLOTS.
     Subdivision 1. Form. Except as provided in this section, state primary ballots ­    s­h­a­l
                                                                                              l­ must be
printed in the same manner as state general election ballots as far as practicable. A sufficient number
­
s­
 h­ l­ must be printed for each precinct and ward in the state.
   a­l
     The secretary of state shall adopt rules for the format and preparation of the state primary ballot.
     Subd. 1a. Heading; voter instructions; partisan and nonpartisan sections. The state primary
ballot must be headed by the words "State Primary Ballot." If a primary ballot contains both a
partisan and a nonpartisan section, the instructions to voters must include a statement that reads
substantially as follows: "This ballot contains a partisan and a nonpartisan section. On the partisan
section, you are only allowed to vote for candidates of one political party." If only partisan races are
listed on the ballot, above the party names, the following statement must be printed. "You are only
allowed to vote for the candidates of one political party in a primary." If a primary ballot contains
political party columns on both sides of the ballot, the instructions to voters must include a statement
that reads substantially as follows: "Additional political parties are printed on the other side of this
ballot. Vote for one political party only." At the bottom of each political party column on the primary
ballot, the ballot must contain a statement that reads substantially as follows: "Continue voting in
the nonpartisan section."
   Subd. 2. Blank lines prohibited. At a primary ­e­e  t­o
                                                      c­i

                                                           ­, no blank lines shall be provided for
writing in the names of individuals whose names do not appear on the primary ballot.
    Subd. 3. R­o­­­­
                 ta t­o ­ Alternation of names. On state primary ballots the name of each candidate
                     i­ n
for nomination to a partisan or nonpartisan office shall be ­r­
                                                              o­a

                                                                  t­d­ alternated with the names of the
other candidates for nomination to that office in various precincts so that the name of each candidate
appears substantially an equal number of times at the top, at the bottom, and at each intermediate
place in that group of candidates. However, the arrangement of candidates' names must be the same
on all ballots used in the same precinct. If the number of names to be alternated exceeds the number
of precincts, the county auditor shall determine by lot the alternation of names. If the number of
candidates for an office is equal to or less than the number to be elected, no ­  ro   t­o
                                                                                     t­­i
                                                                                   ­­a    ­n

candidate names is required and the official preparing the ballot shall determine the position of the
candidates by lot.

for each question. The title must be approved by the attorney general and consist of not more than
one printed line above the question to which it refers. Just below the title, a conspicuous notice
must be printed stating that a voter's failure to vote on a constitutional amendment has the effect of
a negative vote.
    Subd. 6. Additional pages. When it would not be possible to place all offices on a single ballot,
the judicial offices may be placed instead on a separate ballot. This ballot must be prepared by the
county auditor in the manner provided in the rules of the secretary of state and must be headed with
the words: "Judicial General Election Ballot."

odd-numbered year, the county auditor and municipal clerk may mutually decide to use the election
reporting system for the election. If so, the county auditor must notify the secretary of state of
the intent to use the election reporting system at least 90 days before the election, of who will
be entering the data, and, if the municipal clerk will be entering the data, that the office of the
municipal clerk has the technological capacity to enter the data. The county auditor or, with the
consent of the county auditor, the municipal clerk must enter the offices and questions to be voted
on in the municipality and the list of candidates for each office into the election results reporting
system no later than 46 days before the election.

Between 11 and 17 days after ­ an­ a state general election, and within 17 days after any other election,
the governing body of a city conducting any election including a special municipal election, or the
governing body of a town conducting the general election in November shall act as the canvassing
board, canvass the returns, and declare the results of the election. The governing body of a town
conducting the general election in March shall act as the canvassing board, canvass the returns, and
declare the results of the election within two days after an election.
    (b) After the time for contesting elections has passed, the municipal clerk shall issue a certificate
of election to each successful candidate. In case of a contest, the certificate shall not be issued until
the outcome of the contest has been determined by the proper court.
    (c) In case of a tie vote, the canvassing board having jurisdiction over the municipality shall
determine the result by lot. The clerk of the canvassing board shall certify the results of the election
to the county auditor, and the clerk shall be the final custodian of the ballots and the returns of the
election.

   Sec. 175. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205.185, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Review of rejected absentee ballots. Before an election not held in conjunction with
a state election, a clerk may arrange to have a certified election administrator from another city
or county review all ballots that were marked rejected to determine whether any were rejected in
error. These arrangements must be made at least seven days before the date of the election. If no
arrangements are made, rejected absentee ballots must not be reviewed outside of an election contest
under chapter 209. If the certified election administrator determines that any were rejected in error,
the canvassing board must publicly open the return and ballot envelopes and initial and count the
ballots to include the votes in all races in the results canvassed by the board. The canvassing board
must protect the privacy of the voters' choices to the extent practicable. If the number of rejected
absentee ballots could not possibly change the outcome in any of the elections or questions on the
ballot, the clerk may cancel the review of the rejected absentee ballots.
   Sec. 176. [205.187] ELECTION RESULTS REPORTING SYSTEM; PRECINCT VOTES.
   For regularly scheduled municipal elections held in November of an even-numbered year, the
county auditor shall enter the votes in each precinct for the questions and offices voted on in the
municipal election into the election results reporting system provided by the secretary of state.
    If a county auditor has notified the secretary of state under section 205.135, subdivision 2, of
intent to use the election results reporting system for a municipal election, the county auditor, or
with the consent of the county auditor the municipal clerk, must enter the votes in each precinct for
the offices and questions voted on in the municipality into the election results reporting system.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the election reporting system has been tested and shown to properly allow for the entry of candidate
names and for election results to be uploaded, and to be able to handle the expected volume of use.
   Sec. 177. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205.84, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General provisions. (a) In a city electing council members by wards, wards shall
be as equal in population as practicable and each ward shall be composed of compact, contiguous
territory. Each council member shall be a resident of the ward for which elected, but, except as
otherwise provided by paragraph (b), a change in ward boundaries does not disqualify a council
member from serving for the remainder of a term.
     (b) Notwithstanding any home rule charter provision to the contrary, in a city of the first class
where council members are elected by ward to serve for four years to terms that are not staggered,
if the population of any ward changes by five percent or more, all council members must be elected
to new terms at the first municipal general election after ward boundaries are redefined under
subdivision 2; provided, however, that if no municipal general election would otherwise occur in
the year ending in "2" or the year ending in "3," a municipal general election must be held in one

may be tabulated and reported by the school district as a whole rather than by precinct. For school
district elections not held in conjunction with a statewide election, the school board shall appoint
election judges as provided in section 204B.21, subdivision 2. The provisions of sections 204B.19,
subdivision 5; 204B.21, subdivision 2; 204C.15; 204C.19; 206.83; and 206.86, subdivision 2,
relating to party balance in appointment of judges and to duties to be performed by judges of
different major political parties do not apply to school district elections not held in conjunction
with a statewide election.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is not effective until the secretary of state has certified that
the statewide voter registration system has been tested, shown to properly allow municipal clerks to
update absentee voting records, and shown to be able to handle the expected volume of use.

11 and 17 days after a school district election held concurrently with a state general election, and
within seven days after a school district election held on any other date, other than a recount of a
special election conducted under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, or 475.59, the school board shall
canvass the returns and declare the results of the election. After the time for contesting elections
has passed, the school district clerk shall issue a certificate of election to each successful candidate.
If there is a contest, the certificate of election to that office must not be issued until the outcome
of the contest has been determined by the proper court. If there is a tie vote, the school board
shall determine the result by lot. The clerk shall deliver the certificate of election to the successful
candidate by personal service or certified mail. The successful candidate shall file an acceptance
and oath of office in writing with the clerk within 30 days of the date of mailing or personal service.
A person who fails to qualify prior to the time specified shall be deemed to have refused to serve,
but that filing may be made at any time before action to fill the vacancy has been taken. The school
district clerk shall certify the results of the election to the county auditor, and the clerk shall be the
final custodian of the ballots and the returns of the election.
   A school district canvassing board shall perform the duties of the school board according to the
requirements of this subdivision for a recount of a special election conducted under section 126C.17,
subdivision 9, or 475.59.
   Sec. 195. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205A.10, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 6. Review of rejected absentee ballots. Before an election not held in conjunction with
a state election, a clerk may arrange to have a certified election administrator from a city or county
review all ballots that were marked rejected to determine whether any were rejected in error. These
arrangements must be made at least seven days before the date of the election. If no arrangements
are made, rejected absentee ballots must not be reviewed outside of an election contest under chapter
209. If the certified election administrator determines that any were rejected in error, the canvassing
board must publicly open the return and ballot envelopes and initial and count the ballots to include
the votes in all races in the results canvassed by the board. The canvassing board must protect the
privacy of the voters' choices to the extent practicable. If the number of rejected absentee ballots
could not possibly change the outcome in any of the elections or questions on the ballot, the clerk
may cancel the review of the rejected absentee ballots.
   Sec. 196. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205A.11, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedure. The designation of a polling place under this section remains effective until
a different polling place is designated. No designation of a new or different polling place becomes
effective less than 90 days before an election, except that a new polling place may be designated
to replace a polling place that has become unavailable for use. The school board must notify the
county auditor within 30 days after the establishment of a polling place as provided in this section.
The notice must include a list of the precincts that will be voting at each polling place. The school
board must send the notice required by section 204B.16, subdivision 1a, after a polling place is
established as provided in this section, but no additional notices of this kind are required for any
subsequent similar elections until the location of the polling place or the combination of precincts
voting at the polling place is changed. The secretary of state shall provide a single polling place
roster for use in any polling place established as provided in this section. A single set of election
judges must be appointed to serve in the polling place. The number of election judges required must
be based on the total number of persons voting at the last similar election in all the precincts to be

Election Assistance Commission. The application must be accompanied by the certification report
of the voting systems test laboratory. A certification under this section from an independent testing
authority accredited by the Election Assistance Commission meets the requirement of Minnesota
Rules, part 8220.0350, item L. A vendor must provide a copy of the source code for the voting
system to the secretary of state. A chair of a major political party or the secretary of state may
select, in consultation with the vendor, an independent third-party evaluator to examine the source
code to ensure that it functions as represented by the vendor and that the code is free from defects.
A major political party that elects to have the source code examined must pay for the examination.
Except as provided by this subdivision, source code that is trade secret information must be treated
as nonpublic information, in accordance with section 13.37. A third-party evaluator must not
disclose the source code to anyone else.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 199. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 206.82, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Plan. The municipal clerk in a municipality where an electronic voting system is used
and the county auditor of a county in which an electronic voting system is used in more than one
municipality and the county auditor of a county in which a counting center serving more than
one municipality is located shall prepare a plan which indicates acquisition of sufficient facilities,
computer time, and professional services and which describes the proposed manner of complying
with section 206.80. The plan must be signed, notarized, and submitted to the secretary of state more
than 60 days before the first election at which the municipality uses an electronic voting system. Prior
to July 1 of each odd-numbered year, and at least ten weeks before the date of the state primary in
each subsequent general election year, the clerk or auditor shall submit to the secretary of state
notification of any changes to the plan on file with the secretary of state. The secretary of state
shall review each plan for its sufficiency and may request technical assistance from the Department
of Administration or other agency which may be operating as the central computer authority. The
secretary of state shall notify each reporting authority of the sufficiency or insufficiency of its plan
within 20 days of receipt of the plan. The attorney general, upon request of the secretary of state, may
seek a district court order requiring an election official to fulfill duties imposed by this subdivision
or by rules promulgated pursuant to this section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the state primary in 2010 and thereafter.

statistics to evaluate the performance of the electronic voting system or other aspects of the election.
   Sec. 203. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 206.89, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Selection for review; notice. At the canvass of the state primary, the county canvassing
board in each county must set the date, time, and place for the postelection review of the state general
election to be held under this section.
    At the canvass of the state general election, the county canvassing boards must select the
precincts to be reviewed by lot. The early ballots counted centrally and the ballots counted by
each ballot board must be considered a precinct eligible to be selected for the purposes of this
subdivision. The county canvassing board of a county with fewer than 50,000 registered voters
must conduct a postelection review of a total of at least two precincts. The county canvassing
board of a county with between 50,000 and 100,000 registered voters must conduct a review of
a total of at least three precincts. The county canvassing board of a county with over 100,000
registered voters must conduct a review of a total of at least four precincts, or three percent of the
total number of precincts in the county, whichever is greater. At least one precinct selected in each
county must have had more than 150 votes cast at the general election.
    The county auditor must notify the secretary of state of the precincts that have been chosen for
review and the time and place the postelection review for that county will be conducted, as soon as
the decisions are made. If the selection of precincts has not resulted in the selection of at least four
precincts in each congressional district, the secretary of state may require counties to select by lot
additional precincts to meet the congressional district requirement. The secretary of state must post
this information on the office Web site.
   Sec. 204. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 206.89, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Scope and conduct of review. The county canvassing board shall appoint the
postelection review official as defined in subdivision 1. The postelection review must be conducted
of the votes cast for president or governor; United States senator; and United States representative,
except that a review of a race must not be conducted if that race is subject to an automatic recount
under section 204C.35. The postelection review official may conduct postelection review of the
votes cast for additional offices.
    The postelection review must be conducted in public at the location where the voted ballots
have been securely stored after the state general election or at another location chosen by the county
canvassing board. The postelection review official for each precinct selected must conduct the
postelection review and may be assisted by election judges designated by the postelection review
official for this purpose. The party balance requirement of section 204B.19 applies to election
judges designated for the review. The postelection review must consist of a manual count of the
ballots used in the precincts selected and must be performed in the manner provided by section
204C.21. The postelection review must be conducted in the manner provided for recounts under
section 204C.361 to the extent practicable. The review must be completed no later than two days
before the meeting of the state canvassing board to certify the results of the state general election.

days following the state general election.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the state primary in 2010 and thereafter.
     Sec. 210. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 211B.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Labels prohibited. Write-in candidates must not distribute labels to voters to be
affixed to optical scan ballots in precincts in which ballots are tabulated by precinct or central count
optical scan tabulators. A violation of this subdivision by a candidate is subject to a civil penalty of
up to $5,000 per precinct in the district. The civil penalty is payable to the jurisdiction that owns
the ballot tabulators for use in election equipment repair and maintenance. Notwithstanding section
211B.37, the costs of a complaint alleging violation of this subdivision shall be assessed against the
candidate.
     Sec. 211. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 412.02, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Vacancy. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision 2b, a vacancy in an office shall
be filled by council appointment until an election is held as provided in this subdivision. In case of
a tie vote in the council, the mayor shall make the appointment.
    (1) If the vacancy occurs before the first day to file affidavits of candidacy for the next regular
city election and more than two years remain in the unexpired term, a special election shall be held
at or before the next regular city election and the appointed person shall serve until the qualification
of a successor elected at a special election to fill the unexpired portion of the term. The council must
specify by ordinance under what circumstances it will hold a special election to fill a vacancy other
than a special election held at the same time as the regular city election. If, because of a vacancy,
more than one council member is to be chosen at the same election, candidates for council member
shall file for either a two-year or a four-year term. If more than one candidate is to be elected for the
same length term, the ballot must instruct voters to "Vote for up to ..." up to the number of candidates
to be elected for the two-year or four-year term.

      (2) If the vacancy occurs on or after the first day to file affidavits of candidacy for the regular
city election or when less than two years remain in the unexpired term, there need not be a special
election to fill the vacancy and the appointed person shall serve until the qualification of a successor.

    Sec. 212. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 414.02, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Effective date of incorporation. The incorporation shall be effective upon the election
and qualification of new municipal officers or on such later date as is fixed by the director's order.
The effective date must not fall within the 21 days before a regularly scheduled election. Failure
to comply with the provisions of this subdivision with respect to regularly scheduled elections, or
to set the right effective date in relation to regularly scheduled elections, does not invalidate the
annexation.
    Sec. 213. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 414.031, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
     Subd. 6. Effective date of annexation. The annexation shall be effective as of the date fixed
in the annexation order or on a later date fixed in the annexation order. The effective date must not
fall within the 21 days before a regularly scheduled election. Failure to comply with the provisions
of this subdivision with respect to regularly scheduled elections, or to set the right effective date in
relation to regularly scheduled elections, does not invalidate the annexation.
    Sec. 214. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 414.0325, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Initiating the proceeding. (a) One or more townships and one or more
municipalities, by joint resolution, may designate an unincorporated area as in need of orderly
annexation. One or more municipalities, by joint resolution with the county, may designate an
unincorporated area in which there is no organized township government as in need of orderly
annexation.
    (b) A designated area is any area which the signatories to a joint resolution for orderly annexation
have identified as being appropriate for annexation, either currently or at some point in the future,
pursuant to the negotiated terms and conditions set forth in the joint resolution. Land described as a
designated area is not, by virtue of being so described, considered also to be annexed for purposes
of this chapter.
    (c) The joint resolution will confer jurisdiction on the chief administrative law judge over
annexations in the designated area and over the various provisions in said agreement by submission
of said joint resolution to the chief administrative law judge.
   (d) The resolution shall include a description of the designated area and the reasons for
designation.
    (e) Thereafter, an annexation of any part of the designated area may be initiated by:
    (1) submitting to the chief administrative law judge a resolution of any signatory to the joint
resolution; or
    (2) the chief administrative law judge.
    (f) Whenever a state agency, other than the pollution control agency, orders a municipality to
3702                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

extend a municipal service to an area, the order confers jurisdiction on the chief administrative law
judge to consider designation of the area for orderly annexation.
    (g) If a joint resolution designates an area as in need of orderly annexation and states that no
alteration of its stated boundaries is appropriate, the chief administrative law judge may review and
comment, but may not alter the boundaries.
    (h) If a joint resolution designates an area as in need of orderly annexation, provides for the
conditions for its annexation, and states that no consideration by the chief administrative law judge
is necessary, the chief administrative law judge may review and comment, but shall, within 30 days,
order the annexation in accordance with the terms of the resolution. A joint resolution filed within
the 51 days before a regularly scheduled election must provide in the conditions for its annexation
that the annexation will not be effective until the day after the regularly scheduled election. Failure
to comply with the provisions of this subdivision with respect to regularly scheduled elections, or
to set the right effective date in relation to regularly scheduled elections, does not invalidate the
annexation.
   Sec. 215. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 414.0325, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Effective date of annexation. The chief administrative law judge's order shall be
effective upon the issuance of the order or at such later time as is provided in the order. The effective
date must not fall within the 21 days before a regularly scheduled election. Failure to comply with
the provisions of this subdivision with respect to regularly scheduled elections, or to set the right
effective date in relation to regularly scheduled elections, does not invalidate the annexation.
   Sec. 216. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 414.033, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Filing; effective date; copy to auditors. Any annexation ordinance provided for
in this section must be filed with the chief administrative law judge, the township, the county
auditor and the secretary of state and is final on the date the ordinance is approved by the chief
administrative law judge, except that an ordinance approved within the 21 days before a regularly
scheduled election is not effective until the day after the regularly scheduled election. A copy of the
annexation ordinance must be delivered immediately by the governing body of the municipality
to the appropriate county auditors. Failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision with
respect to regularly scheduled elections, or to set the right effective date in relation to regularly
scheduled elections, does not invalidate the annexation.
   Sec. 217. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 447.32, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Candidates; ballots; certifying election. A person who wants to be a candidate for the
hospital board shall file an affidavit of candidacy for the election either as member at large or as a
member representing the city or town where the candidate resides. The affidavit of candidacy must
be filed with the city or town clerk not more than ­70
                                                     ­ 84 days nor less than 5 ­­

Tuesday after the first Monday in November of the year in which the general election is held and no
more than 70 days and no less than 56 days before the election in an odd-numbered year. The city
or town clerk must forward the affidavits of candidacy to the clerk of the hospital district or, for the
first election, the clerk of the most populous city or town immediately after the last day of the filing
period. A candidate may withdraw from the election by filing an affidavit of withdrawal with the
clerk of the district no later than 5:00 p.m. two days after the last day to file affidavits of candidacy.

    Voting must be by secret ballot. The clerk shall prepare, at the expense of the district, necessary
ballots for the election of officers. Ballots must be printed on ­a  t­­
                                                                       n paper and prepared as provided
in the rules of the secretary of state. In hospital district elections not held in conjunction with other
elections, ballots shall be prepared in the same manner as state primary and state general election
ballots, to the extent practicable. The ballots must be marked and initialed by at least two judges as
official ballots and used exclusively at the election. Any proposition to be voted on may be printed
on the ballot provided for the election of officers. The hospital board may also authorize the use
of voting systems subject to chapter 206. Enough election judges may be appointed to receive the
votes at each polling place. The election judges shall act as clerks of election, count the ballots cast,
and submit them to the board for canvass.
    After canvassing the election, the board shall issue a certificate of election to the candidate who
received the largest number of votes cast for each office. The clerk shall deliver the certificate to the
person entitled to it in person or by certified mail. Each person certified shall file an acceptance and
oath of office in writing with the clerk within 30 days after the date of delivery or mailing of the
certificate. The board may fill any office as provided in subdivision 1 if the person elected fails to
qualify within 30 days, but qualification is effective if made before the board acts to fill the vacancy.
   Sec. 218. Laws 2005, chapter 162, section 34, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Optical scan equipment. $6,000,000 is appropriated from the Help America Vote Act
account to the secretary of state for grants to counties to purchase optical scan voting equipment.
Counties are eligible for grants to the extent that they decide to purchase ballot marking machines
and as a result do not have sufficient Help America Vote Act grant money remaining to also purchase
a compatible precinct-based optical scan machine or central-count machine. These grants must be
allocated to counties at a rate of $3,000 per eligible precinct until the appropriation is exhausted,
with priority in the payment of grants to be given to counties currently using hand- and central-count
voting systems and counties using precinct-count optical scan voting systems incompatible with
assistive voting systems or ballot marking machines. This appropriation is available until June 30,

proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal. If the municipality does not award
a contract, all short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the municipality cancels the
contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the municipality shall award each design-builder
on the short list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the municipality's
estimated cost of design and construction. The municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to each
proposer within 90 days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract.
In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the municipality may use any ideas or information
contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project or in connection
with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the
unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subdivision, an unsuccessful
short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short-list proposer
elects to waive the stipulated fee, the municipality may not use ideas and information contained in
that proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the municipality, a proposer who waived a stipulated
fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the municipality shall pay the stipulated fee to the
proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the proposer's proposal.

proposals to protest a contemplated or actual award by the commissioner by, among other things,
unreasonably restricting the time to protest; restricting the right to seek judicial review of the
commissioner's actions; attempting to change the judicial standard of review; or requiring the
protestor to pay attorney fees for an unsuccessful, nonfrivolous protest. Unless all design-builders
that have submitted proposals agree to execution of a contract for the project without a waiting
period beforehand, the municipality shall wait at least seven days after both the award of the
project and public disclosure of the Technical Review Committee's scoring data and the successful
proposal before executing a contract for the project.
    Subd. 11. Low-bid design-build process. (a) The municipality may also use low-bid,
design-build procedures to award a design-build contract where the scope of the work can be
clearly defined.
   (b) Low-bid design-build projects may require an RFQ and short-listing, and must require an
RFP.
    (c) Submitted proposals under this subdivision must include separately a technical proposal and
a price proposal. The low-bid, design-build procedures must follow a two-step process for review
of the responses to the RFP as follows:
   (1) the first step is the review of the technical proposal by the Technical Review Committee as
provided in subdivision 5. The Technical Review Committee must open the technical proposal first
and must determine if it complies with the requirements of the RFP and is responsive. The Technical
Review Committee may not perform any ranking or scoring of the technical proposals; and
  (2) the second step is the determination of the low bidder based on the price proposal. The
municipality may not open the price proposal until the review of the technical proposal is complete.
  (d) The contract award under low-bid, design-build procedures must be made to the proposer
whose sealed bid is responsive to the technical requirements as determined by the Technical Review
Committee and that is also the lowest bid.
   (e) A stipulated fee may be paid for unsuccessful bids on low-bid, design-build projects only

of the commissioner, subject to the process provided by this section, and available unencumbered
money in the appropriation. The commissioner's decisions and application of the priorities under
section 116J.555 are not subject to judicial review, except for abuse of discretion.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116J.555, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Priorities. (a) The legislature expects that applications for grants will exceed the
available appropriations and the agency will be able to provide grants to only some of the applicant
development authorities.
    (b) If applications for grants for qualified sites exceed the available appropriations, the agency
shall make grants for sites that, in the commissioner's judgment, provide the highest return in public
benefits for the public costs incurred and that meet all the requirements provided by law. In making
this judgment, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the recommendations or ranking of projects by the commissioner of the Pollution Control
Agency regarding the potential threat to public health and the environment that would be reduced
or eliminated by completion of each of the response action plans;
    (2) the potential increase in the property tax base of the local taxing jurisdictions, considered
relative to the fiscal needs of the jurisdictions, that will result from developments that will occur
because of completion of each of the response action plans;
    (3) the social value to the community of the cleanup and redevelopment of the site, including
the importance of development of the proposed public facilities on each of the sites;
    (4) the probability that each site will be cleaned up without use of government money in the
reasonably foreseeable future by considering but not limited to the current market value of the site
versus the cleanup cost;
   (5) the amount of cleanup costs for each site; and

   (6) the amount of the commitment of municipal or other local resources to pay for the cleanup
costs.
    The factors are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather the commissioner may weigh each
factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner considers appropriate. The
commissioner may consider other factors that affect the net return of public benefits for completion
of the response action plan. The commissioner, notwithstanding the listing of priorities and the goal
of maximizing the return of public benefits, shall make grants that distribute available money to
sites both within and outside of the metropolitan area. The commissioner shall provide a written
statement of the supporting reasons for each grant. Unless sufficient applications are not received
for qualifying sites outside of the metropolitan area, at least 2
                                                                ­5

equip, maintain and operate at any correctional facility under the commissioner's control such
industrial and commercial activities as may be deemed necessary and suitable to the profitable
employment, educational training and development of proper work habits of the inmates of state
correctional facilities. The industrial and commercial activities authorized by this section are
designated MINNCOR industries and shall be for the primary purpose of sustaining and ensuring
MINNCOR industries' self-sufficiency, providing educational training, meaningful employment
and the teaching of proper work habits to the inmates of correctional facilities under the control
of the commissioner of corrections, and not solely as competitive business ventures. The net
profits from these activities shall be used for the benefit of the inmates as it relates to education,
self-sufficiency skills, and transition services and not to fund non-inmate-related activities or
mandates. Prior to the establishment of any industrial and commercial activity, the commissioner
of corrections may consult with representatives of business, industry, organized labor, the state
Department of Education, the state Apprenticeship Council, the state Department of Labor and
Industry, the Department of Employment S     ­­

                                          ­o
in the revolving fund that originated as operational charges to individuals licensed under this
subdivision for the establishment, operation, and supervision of vending stands by blind persons
for the following purposes:
   (1) purchase, upkeep and replacement of equipment;
   (2) expenses incidental to the setting up of new stands and improvement of old stands;
   (3) reimbursement under section 15.059 to individual blind vending operators for reasonable
expenses incurred in attending supervisory meetings as called by the commissioner and other
expenditures for management services consistent with federal law; and
    (4) purchase of fringe benefits for blind vending operators and their employees such as group
health insurance, retirement program, vacation or sick leave assistance provided that the purchase
of any fringe benefit is approved by a majority vote of blind vending operators licensed pursuant to
this subdivision after the commissioner provides to each blind vending operator information on all
matters relevant to the fringe benefits. "Majority vote" means a majority of blind vending operators
voting. Fringe benefits shall be paid only from assessments of operators for specific benefits, gifts
to the fund for fringe benefit purposes, and vending income which is not assignable to an individual
stand.
    (c) Money originally deposited as merchandise and supplies repayments by individuals
licensed under this subdivision may be expended for initial and replacement stocks of supplies and
merchandise. Money originally deposited from vending income on federal property must be spent
consistent with federal law.
   (d) All other deposits may be used for the purchase of general liability insurance or any other
expense related to the operation and supervision of vending stands.
    (e) The commissioner shall issue each license for the operation of a vending stand or vending
machine for an indefinite period but may terminate any license in the manner provided. In granting
licenses for new or vacated stands preference on the basis of seniority of experience in operating
stands under the control of the commissioner shall be given to capable operators who are deemed
competent to handle the enterprise under consideration. Application of this preference shall not
prohibit the commissioner from selecting an operator from the community in which the stand is
located.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.626, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. County and tribal biennial service agreements. (a) Effective January 1, 2004, and
each two-year period thereafter, each county and tribe must have in place an approved biennial
service agreement related to the services and programs in this chapter. In counties with a city of
the first class with a population over 300,000, the county must consider a service agreement that
includes a jointly developed plan for the delivery of employment services with the city. Counties
may collaborate to develop multicounty, multitribal, or regional service agreements.
   (b) The service agreements will be completed in a form prescribed by the commissioner. The
agreement must include:
   (1) a statement of the needs of the service population and strengths and resources in the
3790                                    JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                          [46TH DAY

community;
    (2) numerical goals for participant outcomes measures to be accomplished during the biennial
period. The commissioner may identify outcomes from section 256J.751, subdivision 2, as core
outcomes for all counties and tribes;
    (3) strategies the county or tribe will pursue to achieve the outcome targets. Strategies must
include specification of how funds under this section will be used and may include community
partnerships that will be established or strengthened;
    (4) strategies the county or tribe will pursue under family stabilization services; and
    (5) other items prescribed by the commissioner in consultation with counties and tribes.
    (c) The commissioner shall provide each county and tribe with information needed to complete
an agreement, including: (1) information on MFIP cases in the county or tribe; (2) comparisons with
the rest of the state; (3) baseline performance on outcome measures; and (4) promising program
practices.
    (d) The service agreement must be submitted to the commissioner by October 15, 2003, and
October 15 of each second year thereafter. The county or tribe must allow a period of not less than
30 days prior to the submission of the agreement to solicit comments from the public on the contents
of the agreement.
    (e) The commissioner must, within 60 days of receiving each county or tribal service agreement,
inform the county or tribe if the service agreement is approved. If the service agreement is not
approved, the commissioner must inform the county or tribe of any revisions needed prior to
approval.

payments to employers for on-the-job training costs that, during the period of the training, must not
exceed 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to the participant. The payments are deemed

    Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.169, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Evaluation of applications. (a) The commissioner shall review and evaluate the
applications submitted pursuant to subdivision 2 and shall determine whether each area is eligible
for designation as an enterprise zone. In determining whether an area is eligible under section
469.168, subdivision 4, paragraph (a), if unemployment, employment, income, or other necessary
data are not available for the area from the federal departments of labor or commerce or the state
demographer, the commissioner may rely upon other data submitted by the municipality if the
commissioner determines it is statistically reliable or accurate. The commissioner, together with
the commissioner of revenue, shall prepare an estimate of the amount of state tax revenue which
will be foregone for each application if the area is designated as a zone.
    (b) By October 1 of each year, the commissioner shall submit to the Legislative Advisory
Commission a list of the areas eligible for designation as enterprise zones, along with
recommendations for designation and supporting documentation. In making recommendations
for designation, the commissioner shall consider and evaluate the applications pursuant to the
following criteria:
    (1) the pervasiveness of poverty, unemployment, and general distress in the area;
   (2) the extent of chronic abandonment, deterioration, or reduction in value of commercial,
industrial, or residential structures in the area and the extent of property tax arrearages in the area;
    (3) the prospects for new investment and economic development in the area with the tax
reductions proposed in the application relative to the state and local tax revenue which would be
foregone;
    (4) the competing needs of other areas of the state;
    (5) the municipality's proposed use of other state and federal development funds or programs to
increase the probability of new investment and development occurring;
    (6) the extent to which the projected development in the zone will provide employment to
residents of the economic hardship area, and particularly individuals who are unemployed or who
are economically disadvantaged as defined in the federal ­         J­

    Subd. 2. Unemployment benefits paid from state funds. Unemployment benefits are paid from
state funds and are not considered paid from any special insurance plan, nor as paid by an employer.
An application for unemployment benefits is not considered a claim against an employer but is
considered a request for unemployment benefits from the trust fund. The commissioner has the
responsibility for the proper payment of unemployment benefits regardless of the level of interest
or participation by an applicant or an employer in any determination or appeal. An applicant's
entitlement to unemployment benefits must be determined based upon that information available

    Subd. 3. Payments that delay unemployment benefits. (a) An applicant is not eligible to
receive unemployment benefits for any week with respect to which the applicant is receiving, has
received, or has filed for payment, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, in the form of:
   (1) vacation pay paid upon temporary, indefinite, or seasonal separation. This clause does not
apply to (i) vacation pay paid upon a permanent separation from employment, or (ii) vacation pay
paid from a vacation fund administered by a union or a third party not under the control of the
employer;
   (2) severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, and any other payments, except earnings under
subdivision 5, and back pay under subdivision 6, paid by an employer because of, upon, or after
separation from employment, but only if the payment is considered wages at the time of payment
under section 268.035, subdivision 29; or
     (3) pension, retirement, or annuity payments from any plan contributed to by a base period
employer including the United States government, except Social Security benefits that are provided
for in subdivision 4. The base period employer is considered to have contributed to the plan if the
contribution is excluded from the definition of wages under section 268.035, subdivision 29, clause
(1).

The number of weeks of payment is determined as follows:
    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received is divided by

regular weekly pay from the employer.

    If the back pay is not paid with respect to a specific period, the back pay must be applied to the
period immediately following the last day of employment.
  (b) If the back pay is reduced by the amount of unemployment benefits that have been paid, the
amount of back pay withheld must be:
    (1) paid by the employer to the trust fund within 30 calendar days and subject to the same
collection procedures that apply to past due taxes;
      (2) applied to unemployment benefit overpayments resulting from the payment of the back pay;
and
   (3) credited to the maximum amount of unemployment benefits available to the applicant in a
benefit year that includes the weeks for which back pay was deducted.
    (c) Unemployment benefits paid the applicant must be removed from the computation of the
tax rate for taxpaying employers and removed from the reimbursable account for nonprofit and
government employers that have elected to be liable for reimbursements in the calendar quarter the
trust fund receives payment.
      (d) Payments to the trust fund under this subdivision are considered as made by the applicant.

The attachment to the work force must be genuine. An applicant may restrict availability to suitable
employment, but there must be no other restrictions, either self-imposed or created by circumstances,
temporary or permanent, that prevent accepting suitable employment.
   (b) To be considered "available for suitable employment," a student must be willing to quit
school to accept suitable employment.
    (c) An applicant who is absent from the labor market area for personal reasons, other than to
search for work, is not "available for suitable employment."
   (d) An applicant who has restrictions on the hours of the day or days of the week that the
applicant can or will work, that are not normal for the applicant's usual occupation or other suitable

employment, if suitable employment is performed during the daytime, even though the applicant

UNEMPLOYMENT.
    (a) An applicant who elects to become temporarily unemployed in order to avoid the layoff of
another employee with the applicant's employer due to lack of work is not ineligible for benefits
under the leave of absence provisions of section 268.085, subdivision 13a, nor ineligible under the
quit provisions of section 268.095, if:
    (1) the election is authorized under a collective bargaining agreement or written employer policy;
    (2) the employer has accepted the applicant's election;
   (3) the employer provides a written certification that is provided to the department that the
applicant's election prevented another employee with the employer from being laid off due to lack
of work; and
   (4) both the applicant and the employer, at the time of the election, expect the applicant's
unemployment from the employer to be temporary.
   (b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), for unemployment benefits to be payable,
an applicant must meet all the other benefit eligibility requirements under this chapter, including
being available for suitable employment with a different employer.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Quit. An applicant who quit employment is ineligible for all unemployment
benefits according to subdivision 10 except when:
    (1) the applicant quit the employment because of a good reason caused by the employer as
defined in subdivision 3;
   (2) the applicant quit the employment to accept other covered employment that provided
substantially better terms and conditions of employment, but the applicant did not work long
enough at the second employment to have sufficient subsequent earnings to satisfy the period
of ineligibility that would otherwise be imposed under subdivision 10 for quitting the first
employment;
   (3) the applicant quit the employment within 30 calendar days of beginning the employment
because the employment was unsuitable for the applicant;
    (4) the employment was unsuitable for the applicant and the applicant quit to enter reemployment
assistance training;
    (5) the employment was part time and the applicant also had full-time employment in the base
period, from which full-time employment the applicant separated because of reasons for which the

applicant was held not to be ineligible, and the wage credits from the full-time employment are
sufficient to meet the minimum requirements to establish a benefit account under section 268.07;
    (6) the applicant quit because the employer notified the applicant that the applicant was going
to be laid off because of lack of work within 30 calendar days. An applicant who quit employment
within 30 calendar days of a notified date of layoff because of lack of work is ineligible for
unemployment benefits through the end of the week that includes the scheduled date of layoff;
    (7) the applicant quit the employment because the applicant's serious illness or injury made it
medically necessary that the applicant quit, provided that the applicant inform the employer of the
serious illness or injury and request accommodation and no reasonable accommodation is made
available.
    If the applicant's serious illness is chemical dependency, this exception does not apply if
the applicant was previously diagnosed as chemically dependent or had treatment for chemical
dependency, and since that diagnosis or treatment has failed to make consistent efforts to control
the chemical dependency.

court;
   (ii) a police record documenting the domestic abuse;

    (c) An employee who seeks to withdraw a previously submitted notice of quitting is considered
to have quit the employment if the employer does not agree that the notice may be withdrawn.
    (d) An applicant who, within five calendar days after completion of a suitable temporary job
assignment from a staffing service employer, (1) fails without good cause to affirmatively request
an additional job assignment, ­
                              o­r (2) refuses without good cause an additional suitable job assignment
offered, or (3) accepts employment with the client of the staffing service, is considered to have quit
employment with the staffing service. Accepting employment with the client of the staffing service
meets the requirements of the exception to ineligibility under subdivision 1, clause (2).
   This paragraph applies only if, at the time of beginning of employment with the staffing service
employer, the applicant signed and was provided a copy of a separate document written in clear and
concise language that informed the applicant of this paragraph and that unemployment benefits may
be affected.
    For purposes of this paragraph, "good cause" is a reason that is significant and would compel
an average, reasonable worker, who would otherwise want an additional temporary job assignment
with the staffing service employer, (1) to fail to contact the staffing service employer, or (2) to refuse
an offered assignment.
   For purposes of this paragraph, a "staffing service employer" is an employer whose business
involves employing individuals directly for the purpose of furnishing temporary job assignment
workers to clients of the staffing service.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.103, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Employer-agent appeals filed online. (a) If an agent files an appeal on behalf of an
employer, the appeal must be filed online. The appeal must be filed through the electronic address
provided on the determination being appealed. Use of another method of filing does not constitute
an appeal. This paragraph does not apply to an employee filing an appeal on behalf of an employer.
   (b) All information requested when the appeal is filed must be supplied or the communication
does not constitute an appeal.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.18, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Court fees; collection fees. (a) If the commissioner is required to pay any court fees
in an attempt to enforce collection of overpaid unemployment benefits, penalties, or interest, the
commissioner may add the amount of the court fees to the total amount due.
    (b) If an applicant who has been determined overpaid unemployment benefits because of
fraud seeks to have any portion of the debt discharged under the federal bankruptcy code, and the
commissioner files an objection in bankruptcy court to the discharge, the commissioner may add
the commissioner's cost of any court fees to the debt if the bankruptcy court does not discharge
the debt.
    (c) If the Internal Revenue Service assesses the commissioner a fee for offsetting from a federal
tax refund the amount of any fraud overpayment, including penalties and interest, the amount of the

fee may be added to the total amount due. The offset amount must be put in the trust fund and that
amount credited to the total amount due from the applicant.
    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.186, is amended to read:
    268.186 RECORDS; AUDITS.
    (a) Each employer must keep true and accurate records for the periods of time and containing
the information the commissioner may require by rule. For the purpose of administering this
chapter, the commissioner has the power to audit, examine, or cause to be supplied or copied,
any books, correspondence, papers, records, or memoranda that are relevant, whether the books,
correspondence, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the
employer or any other person at any reasonable time and as often as may be necessary.
     (b) Any employer that refuses to allow an audit of its records by the department, or that fails to
make all necessary records available for audit in Minnesota upon request of the commissioner, may
be assessed an administrative penalty of $500. An employer that fails to provide a weekly breakdown
of money earned by an applicant upon request of the commissioner, information necessary for the
detection of applicant fraud under section 268.18, subdivision 2, may be assessed an administrative
penalty of $100. Any notice requesting a weekly breakdown must clearly state that a $100 penalty
may be assessed for failure to provide the information. The penalty collected is credited to the

    Sec. 16. ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DISLOCATED WORKERS.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. Minnesota has been awarded a federal grant by the United States
Department of Labor under the Project GATE (Growing America Through Entrepreneurship)
program to assist certain dislocated workers in starting a business. Providing unemployment
benefits while the dislocated worker is receiving services such as entrepreneurial training, business
counseling, and technical assistance will assist in the success of this pilot project. In order to
provide unemployment benefits, the commissioner of employment and economic development is
authorized to waive the availability for suitable employment requirements of Minnesota Statutes,
section 268.085, subdivision 1, as well as the earnings deductibility provisions of Minnesota
Statutes, section 268.085, subdivision 5, for individuals enrolled in this pilot project.

    Subd. 2. Statutory application. This chapter is remedial in nature and must be applied in
favor of awarding unemployment benefits. Any legal conclusion that results in an applicant being
ineligible for unemployment benefits must be fully supported by the facts. In determining eligibility
or ineligibility for benefits, any statutory provision that would preclude an applicant from receiving
benefits must be narrowly construed.
    Sec. 2. [268.034] COMPUTATIONS OF MONEY ROUNDED DOWN.
   Computations of money required under this chapter that do not result in a whole dollar are
rounded down to the next lower whole dollar, unless specifically provided otherwise by law.

    (4) in the employ of the operator of a farm in handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging,
processing, freezing, grading, storing, or delivering to storage or to market or to a carrier for
transportation to market, in its unmanufactured state, any agricultural or horticultural commodity;
but only if the operator produced more than one-half of the commodity with respect to which
the employment is performed, or in the employ of a group of operators of farms or a cooperative
organization of which the operators are members, but only if the operators produced more than
one-half of the commodity with respect to which the employment is performed; however, this

    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.042, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Election to have noncovered employment considered covered employment. (a)
Any employer that has employment performed for it that is noncovered employment under section
268.035, subdivision 20, may file with the commissioner, by electronic transmission in a format
prescribed by the commissioner, an election that all employees in that class of employment, in one
or more distinct establishments or places of business, is considered covered employment for not less
than two calendar years. The commissioner has discretion on the approval of any election. Upon the
approval of the commissioner, sent by mail or electronic transmission, the employment constitutes
covered employment beginning the calendar quarter after the date of approval or beginning a later
calendar quarter if requested by the employer. The employment ceases to be considered covered
employment as of the first day of January of any calendar year only if at least 30 calendar days before
the first day of January the employer has filed with the commissioner, by electronic transmission in
a format prescribed by the commissioner, a notice to that effect.
    (b) The commissioner must terminate any election agreement under this subdivision upon 30
calendar days' notice sent by mail or electronic transmission, if the employer is delinquent on any
taxes due or reimbursements due the trust fund.

quarterly wage detail report when due must pay a late fee of $10 per employee, computed based
upon the highest of:
    (1) the number of employees reported on the last wage detail report submitted;
    (2) the number of employees reported in the corresponding quarter of the prior calendar year; or
    (3) if no wage detail report has ever been submitted, the number of employees listed at the time

    Subdivision 1. General rule. Unemployment benefits paid to an applicant, including extended
and shared work benefits, will be used in computing the future tax rate of a taxpaying base period
employer or charged to the reimbursable account of a base period nonprofit or government employer
that has elected to be liable for reimbursements except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3. The
amount of unemployment benefits used in computing the future tax rate of taxpaying employers or
charged to the reimbursable account of a nonprofit or government employer that has elected to be
liable for reimbursements is the same percentage of the total amount of unemployment benefits paid
as the percentage of wage credits from the employer is of the total amount of wage credits from all
the applicant's base period employers.

    Subdivision 1. Payments. (a) Unemployment insurance taxes and any special assessments, fees,
or surcharges accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year on the taxable
wages that the employer paid to employees in covered employment, except for:
      (1) nonprofit organizations that elect to make reimbursements as provided in section 268.053;
and
    (2) the state of Minnesota and political subdivisions that make reimbursements, unless they elect

the wage detail report required under section 268.044 and notify the employer of the tax due. The
taxes and any special assessments, fees, or surcharges must be paid to the trust fund and must be
received by the department on or before the last day of the month following the end of the calendar
quarter.

any quarter, the commissioner must recompute the taxes due for that quarter and assess the employer
for any amount due or credit the employer as appropriate.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.051, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Experience rating history transfer. (a) When:
   (1) a taxpaying employer acquires all of the organization, trade or business, or workforce of
another taxpaying employer; and
    (2) there is 25 percent or more common ownership or there is substantially common management
or control between the predecessor and successor, the experience rating history of the predecessor
employer is transferred to the successor employer.
   (b) When:
   (1) a taxpaying employer acquires a portion, but less than all, of the organization, trade or
business, or workforce of another taxpaying employer; and
    (2) there is 25 percent or more common ownership or there is substantially common
management or control between the predecessor and successor, the successor employer acquires,
as of the date of acquisition, the experience rating history attributable to the portion it acquired, and
the predecessor employer retains the experience rating history attributable to the portion that it has
retained. If the commissioner determines that sufficient information is not available to substantiate
that a distinct severable portion was acquired and to assign the appropriate distinct severable
portion of the experience rating history, the commissioner ­  s­
                                                               h­a­l
                                                                  l­ must assign the successor employer
that percentage of the predecessor employer's experience rating history equal to that percentage of
the employment positions it has obtained, and the predecessor employer retains that percentage of
the experience rating history equal to the percentage of the employment positions it has retained.
   (c) The term "common ownership" for purposes of this subdivision includes ownership by a
spouse, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or first
cousin, by birth or by marriage.
    (d) Each successor employer that is subject to paragraph (a) or (b) must notify the commissioner
of the acquisition by electronic transmission, in a format prescribed by the commissioner, within
30 calendar days of the date of acquisition. Any successor employer that fails to notify the
commissioner is subject to the penalties under section 268.184, subdivision 1a, if the successor's

the penalties are credited to the administration account to be used to ensure integrity in the
unemployment insurance program.
    (e) If the successor employer under paragraphs (a) and (b) had an experience rating at the time
of the acquisition, the transferred experience rating history of the predecessor is combined with the
successor's experience rating history for purposes of recomputing a tax rate.
  (f) If there has been a transfer of an experience rating history under paragraph (a) or (b),
employment with a predecessor employer is not considered to have been terminated if similar
employment is offered by the successor employer and accepted by the employee.

     (g) The commissioner, upon notification of an employer, or upon the commissioner's own motion
if the employer fails to provide the required notification, ­

successor within the meaning of this subdivision. The commissioner ­    s­
                                                                         h­ l­ must, after determining

                                l­must send the recomputed tax rate to all affected employers by mail
or electronic transmission. Any affected employer may appeal the recomputed tax rate in accordance
with the procedures in subdivision 6, paragraph (c).
    (h) The "experience rating history" for purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 4a means
the amount of unemployment benefits paid and the taxable wages that are being used and would be
used in computing the current and any future experience rating.
    For purposes of this chapter, an "acquisition" means anything that results in the obtaining by the
successor employer, in any way or manner, of the organization, trade or business, or workforce of
the predecessor employer.
   A "distinct severable portion" in paragraph (b) means a location or unit separately identifiable
within the employer's wage detail report under section 268.044.
    (i) Regardless of the ownership, management, or control requirements of paragraph (a), if there is
an acquisition or merger of a publicly held corporation by or with another publicly held corporation
the experience rating histories of the corporations are combined as of the date of acquisition or
merger for the purpose of recomputing a tax rate.

    (b) If any tendered payment of any amount due is not honored when presented to a financial
institution for payment, any costs assessed the department by the financial institution and a fee of
$25 must be assessed to the person.

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.07, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Application for unemployment benefits; determination of benefit account.
(a) An application for unemployment benefits may be filed in person, by mail, or by electronic
transmission as the commissioner may require. The applicant must be unemployed at the time
the application is filed and must provide all requested information in the manner required. If
the applicant is not unemployed at the time of the application or fails to provide all requested
information, the communication is not considered an application for unemployment benefits.

    (c) If a base period employer did not provide wage information for the applicant as provided for
in section 268.044, or provided erroneous information, the commissioner may accept an applicant
certification as to wage credits, based upon the applicant's records, and issue a determination of
benefit account.

account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended determination if the
commissioner finds that the determination was incorrect for any reason. An amended determination
of benefit account must be promptly sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by mail
or electronic transmission. This subdivision does not apply to documents titled determinations of
eligibility or determinations of ineligibility issued under section 268.101.
    (e) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly unemployment benefit
amount or maximum amount of unemployment benefits available, any unemployment benefits
that have been paid greater than the applicant was entitled is considered an overpayment of
unemployment benefits. A determination or amended determination issued under this section that
results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount of the overpayment
and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid unemployment benefits
must be repaid.
     Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
  Subd. 2. Benefit account requirements and weekly unemployment benefit amount and
maximum amount of unemployment benefits. (a) To establish a benefit account, an applicant
must have:
     (1) high quarter wage credits of $1,000 or more; and
     (2) wage credits, in other than the high quarter, of $250 or more.
   (b) If an applicant has established a benefit account, the weekly unemployment benefit amount
available during the benefit year is the higher of:
   (1) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the base period, to a maximum of
66-2/3 percent of the state's average weekly wage; or
   (2) 50 percent of the applicant's average weekly wage during the high quarter, to a maximum of
43 percent of the state's average weekly wage.
   The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (1) is computed by dividing the total wage
credits by 52. The applicant's average weekly wage under clause (2) is computed by dividing the
high quarter wage credits by 13.

filing continued requests for unemployment benefits, accessing information, and engaging in other
transactions with the department.
    (b) If a PIN assigned to an applicant is used in the filing of a continued request for unemployment
benefits under section ­26

to have been the individual using that PIN and presumed to have received any unemployment benefit
payment issued. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence showing that
the applicant assigned the PIN was not the individual who used that PIN in the transaction.

    Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.085, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Workers' compensation and disability insurance offset. (a) An applicant is not
eligible to receive unemployment benefits for any week in which the applicant is receiving or
has received compensation for loss of wages equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly
unemployment benefit amount under:
    (1) the workers' compensation law of this state;
    (2) the workers' compensation law of any other state or similar federal law; or
    (3) any insurance or trust fund paid in whole or in part by an employer.

                        ­­) (4), is determined under section 268.101, subdivision ­3 2. If the applicant
later receives compensation as a result of the pending claim, the applicant is subject to the provisions
of paragraph (a) and the unemployment benefits paid are subject to recoupment by the commissioner
to the extent that the compensation constitutes overpaid unemployment benefits.
    (c) If the amount of compensation described under paragraph (a) for any week is less than the
applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount, unemployment benefits requested for that week
are reduced by the amount of that compensation payment.
     Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.085, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Social Security benefits. (a) Any applicant aged 62 or over is required to state
when filing an application for unemployment benefits and when filing continued requests for
unemployment benefits if the applicant is receiving, has filed for, or intends to file for, primary
Social Security old age benefits for any week during the benefit year.

    (1) the Social Security Administration approved the collecting of primary Social Security
disability benefits each month the applicant was employed during the base period; or

    If an applicant meets the requirements of clause (1) there is no deduction from the applicant's
weekly benefit amount for any Social Security disability benefits. If only clause (2) applies, then
there must be deducted from the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount 50 percent of
the weekly equivalent of the primary Social Security disability benefits the applicant is receiving,
has received, or has filed for, with respect to that week; provided, however, that if the Social
Security Administration determines that an individual is not entitled to receive primary Social
Security disability benefits for any week the applicant has applied for those benefits, the 50 percent
deduction does not apply to that week.

    Subd. 5. Deductible earnings. (a) If the applicant has earnings, including holiday pay,
with respect to any week, from employment, covered employment, noncovered employment,
self-employment, or volunteer work, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for that week.
    (b) If the applicant has earnings, with respect to any week, that is less than the applicant's
weekly unemployment benefit amount, from employment, covered employment, noncovered
employment, self-employment, or volunteer work, 55 percent of the earnings are deducted from
the weekly unemployment benefit amount.

    (c) No deduction is made from an applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount for earnings
from service in the National Guard or a United States military reserve unit or from direct service
as a volunteer firefighter or volunteer ambulance service personnel. This exception to paragraphs
(a) and (b) does not apply to on-call or standby pay provided to a volunteer firefighter or volunteer
ambulance service personnel. No deduction is made for jury duty pay or for pay as an election judge.
   (d) The applicant may report deductible earnings on continued requests for unemployment
benefits at the next lower whole dollar amount.
    (e) Deductible earnings does not include any money considered a deductible payment under
subdivision 3, but includes all compensation considered wages under section 268.035, subdivision
29, and any other compensation considered earned income under state and federal law for income
tax purposes.
    Sec. 28. [268.0865] CONTINUED REQUEST FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
    Subdivision 1. Continued request for unemployment benefits defined. A continued request
for unemployment benefits is a certification by an applicant, done on a weekly basis, that the
applicant is unemployed and meets the ongoing eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits
under section 268.085. A continued request must include information on possible issues of
ineligibility in accordance with section 268.101, subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
   Subd. 2. Filing continued requests for unemployment benefits. (a) The commissioner must
designate to each applicant one of the following methods for filing a continued request:
    (1) by electronic transmission under subdivision 3; or
    (2) by mail under subdivision 4.
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                          3815

    (b) The method designated by the commissioner is the only method allowed for filing a continued
request by that applicant. An applicant may ask that the other allowed method be designated and
the commissioner must consider inconvenience to the applicant as well as administrative capacity
in determining whether to allow an applicant to change the designated method for filing a continued
request for unemployment benefits.
    Subd. 3. Continued request for unemployment benefits by electronic transmission. (a)
A continued request for unemployment benefits by electronic transmission must be filed to that
electronic mail address, telephone number, or Internet address prescribed by the commissioner
for that applicant. In order to constitute a continued request, all information asked for, including
information authenticating that the applicant is sending the transmission, must be provided in the
format required. If all of the information asked for is not provided, the communication does not
constitute a continued request for unemployment benefits.
   (b) The electronic transmission communication must be filed on the date and during the time of
day designated for the applicant for filing a continued request by electronic transmission.
     (c) If the electronic transmission continued request is not filed on the date and during the time of
day designated, a continued request by electronic transmission must be accepted if the applicant files
the continued request by electronic transmission within two calendar weeks following the week in
which the date designated occurred. If the continued request by electronic transmission is not filed
within two calendar weeks following the week in which the date designated occurred, the electronic
continued request will not be accepted and the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for
the period covered by the continued request, unless the applicant shows good cause for failing to
file the continued request by electronic transmission within the time period required.
   Subd. 4. Continued request for unemployment benefits by mail. (a) A continued request for
unemployment benefits by mail must be on a form prescribed by the commissioner. The form, in
order to constitute a continued request, must be totally completed and signed by the applicant. The
form must be filed on the date required for the applicant for filing a continued request by mail, in an
envelope with postage prepaid, and sent to the address designated.
    (b) If the mail continued request for unemployment benefits is not filed on the date designated, a
continued request must be accepted if the form is filed by mail within two calendar weeks following
the week in which the date designated occurred. If the form is not filed within two calendar weeks
following the week in which the date designated occurred, the form will not be accepted and the
applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits for the period covered by the continued request
for unemployment benefits, unless the applicant shows good cause for failing to file the form by
mail within the time period required.
    (c) If the applicant has been designated to file a continued request for unemployment benefits by
mail, an applicant may submit the form by facsimile transmission on the day otherwise required for
mailing, or within two calendar weeks following the week in which the date designated occurred. A
form submitted by facsimile transmission must be sent only to the telephone number assigned for
that purpose.
    (d) An applicant who has been designated to file a continued request by mail may personally
deliver a continued request form only to the location to which the form was otherwise designated
to be mailed.

     Subd. 5. Good cause defined. (a) "Good cause" for purposes of this section is a compelling
substantial reason that would have prevented a reasonable person acting with due diligence from
filing a continued request for unemployment benefits within the time periods required.
    (b) "Good cause" does not include forgetfulness, loss of the continued request form if filing by
mail, having returned to work, having an appeal pending, or inability to file a continued request
for unemployment benefits by the method designated if the applicant was aware of the inability
and did not make diligent effort to have the method of filing a continued request changed by the
commissioner. "Good cause" does not include having previously made an attempt to file a continued
request for unemployment benefits but where the communication was not considered a continued
request because the applicant failed to submit all required information.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Ineligibility duration. (a) Ineligibility from the payment of all unemployment benefits
under subdivisions 1 and 4 is for the duration of the applicant's unemployment and until the end of
the calendar week that the applicant had total earnings in subsequent covered employment of eight
times the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount.
   (b) Ineligibility imposed under subdivisions 1 and 4 begins on the Sunday of the week that the
applicant became separated from employment.
    (c) In addition to paragraph (a), if the applicant was discharged from employment because of
aggravated employment misconduct, wage credits from that employment are canceled and cannot
be used for purposes of a benefit account under section 268.07, subdivision 2.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.095, subdivision 11, is amended to read:

program of any other state or established by an act of Congress.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.101, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notification. (a) In an application for unemployment benefits, each applicant
must report the name and the reason for no longer working for the applicant's most recent employer,
as well as the names of all employers and the reasons for no longer working for all employers
during the six calendar months before the date of the application. If the reason reported for no
longer working for any of those employers is other than a layoff because of lack of work, that
raises an issue of ineligibility that the department must determine. An applicant must report any
offers of employment refused during the eight calendar weeks before the date of the application for
unemployment benefits and the name of the employer that made the offer. An applicant's failure to
report the name of an employer, or giving an incorrect reason for no longer working for an employer,
or failing to disclose an offer of employment that was refused, is a violation of section 268.182,
subdivision 2.

    In an application, the applicant must also provide all information necessary to determine the
applicant's eligibility for unemployment benefits under this chapter. If the applicant fails or refuses
to provide information necessary to determine the applicant's eligibility for unemployment benefits,
the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.085, subdivision 2, until the
applicant provides this required information.
     (b) Upon establishment of a benefit account under section 268.07, subdivision 2, the
commissioner shall notify, by mail or electronic transmission, all employers the applicant was
required to report on the application and all base period employers and determined successors
to those employers under section 268.051, subdivision 4, in order to provide the employer
an opportunity to raise, in a manner and format prescribed by the commissioner, any issue of
ineligibility. An employer must be informed of the effect that failure to raise an issue of ineligibility
as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant, w ­­t

                                    ­ 268.0865. Each applicant who stops filing continued requests
during the benefit year and later begins filing continued requests during that same benefit year must
report the name of any employer the applicant worked for during the period between the filing of
continued requests and the reason the applicant stopped working for the employer. The applicant
must report any offers of employment refused during the period between the filing of continued
requests for unemployment benefits. Those employers from which the applicant has reported
a loss of employment under this paragraph must be notified by mail or electronic transmission
and provided an opportunity to raise, in a manner prescribed by the commissioner, any issue of
ineligibility. An employer must be informed of the effect that failure to raise an issue of ineligibility
as a result of a quit or a discharge of the applicant may have on the employer under section 268.047.
    (d) The purpose for requiring the applicant to report the name of employers and the reason for no
longer working for those employers, or offers of employment refused, under paragraphs (a) and (c)
is for the commissioner to obtain information from an applicant raising all issues that may result in
the applicant being ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.095, because of a quit
or discharge, or the applicant being ineligible for unemployment benefits under section 268.085,
subdivision 13c. If the reason given by the applicant for no longer working for an employer is
other than a layoff because of lack of work, that raises an issue of ineligibility and the applicant is
required, as part of the determination process under subdivision 2, paragraph (a), to state all the facts
about the cause for no longer working for the employer, if known. If the applicant fails or refuses
to provide any required information, the applicant is ineligible for unemployment benefits under
section 268.085, subdivision 2, until the applicant provides this required information.
    Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.101, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

raised by information required from an applicant under subdivision 1, paragraph (a) or (c), and send
to the applicant and any involved employer, by mail or electronic transmission, a document titled a
determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility, as is appropriate. The determination
on an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or a discharge of the applicant must state the effect
on the employer under section 268.047. A determination must be made in accordance with this

                                l­ must determine any issue of ineligibility raised by an employer and
send to the applicant and that employer, by mail or electronic transmission, a document titled a
determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility as is appropriate. The determination
on an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant must state the effect on
the employer under section 268.047.
   If a base period employer:
   (1) was not the applicant's most recent employer before the application for unemployment
benefits;
   (2) did not employ the applicant during the six calendar months before the application for
unemployment benefits; and
    (3) did not raise an issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant within
ten calendar days of notification under subdivision 1, paragraph (b);
then any exception under section 268.047, subdivisions 2 and 3, begins the Sunday two weeks
following the week that the issue of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant
was raised by the employer.
    A communication from an employer must specifically set out why the applicant should be
determined ineligible for unemployment benefits for that communication to be considered to have
raised an issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section. A statement of "protest" or a similar
term without more information does not constitute raising an issue of ineligibility for purposes of
this section.
    (c) Subject to section 268.031, an issue of ineligibility is determined based upon that information
required of an applicant, any information that may be obtained from an applicant or employer, and
information from any other source,  ­   i­h

    (d) Regardless of the requirements of this subdivision, the commissioner is not required to send
to an applicant a copy of the determination where the applicant has satisfied a period of ineligibility
because of a quit or a discharge under section 268.095, subdivision 10.
     (e) The commissioner may issue a determination on an issue of ineligibility at any time within 24
months from the establishment of a benefit account based upon information from any source, even
if the issue of ineligibility was not raised by the applicant or an employer. This paragraph does not
prevent the imposition of a penalty on an applicant under section 268.18, subdivision 2, or 268.182.
    (f) A determination of eligibility or determination of ineligibility is final unless an appeal is
filed by the applicant or notified employer within 20 calendar days after sending. The determination
must contain a prominent statement indicating the consequences of not appealing. Proceedings on
the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    (g) An issue of ineligibility required to be determined under this section includes any question
regarding the denial or allowing of unemployment benefits under this chapter except for issues under
section 268.07. An issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section includes any question of effect
on an employer under section 268.047.

    (h) Except for issues of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant, the employer
will be (1) sent a copy of the determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility, or
(2) considered an involved employer for purposes of an appeal under section 268.105, only if the
employer raised the issue of ineligibility.

the beginning of the hearing the unemployment law judge must fully explain how the hearing
will be conducted, that the applicant has the right to request that the hearing be rescheduled
so that documents or witnesses can be subpoenaed, that the facts will be determined based on
a preponderance of the evidence, and, in clear and simple language, the meaning of the term
"preponderance of the evidence." The unemployment law judge must ensure that all relevant facts
are clearly and fully developed. The department may adopt rules on evidentiary hearings. The
rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of
procedure. The department has discretion regarding the method by which the evidentiary hearing
is conducted. A report of any employee of the department, except a determination, made in the
regular course of the employee's duties, is competent evidence of the facts contained in it. An
affidavit or written statement based on personal knowledge and signed under penalty of perjury
is competent evidence of the facts contained in it; however, the veracity of statements contained

within the document or the credibility of the witness making the statement may be disputed with
other documents or testimony and production of such documents or testimony may be compelled
by subpoena.
     (c) After the conclusion of the hearing, upon the evidence obtained, the unemployment law judge
must make findings of fact and decision and send those, by mail or electronic transmission, to all
involved parties. When the credibility of an involved party or witness testifying in an evidentiary
hearing has a significant effect on the outcome of a decision, the unemployment law judge must set
out the reason for crediting or discrediting that testimony. The unemployment law judge's decision
is final unless a request for reconsideration is filed under subdivision 2.
   (d) Regardless of paragraph (c), if the appealing party fails to participate in the evidentiary
hearing, the unemployment law judge has the discretion to dismiss the appeal by summary order.
By failing to participate, the appealing party is considered to have failed to exhaust available
administrative remedies unless the appealing party files a request for reconsideration under
subdivision 2 and establishes good cause for failing to participate in the evidentiary hearing under
subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Submission of a written statement does not constitute participation.
The applicant must participate personally and appearance solely by a representative does not
constitute participation.
   (e) Only employees of the department who are attorneys licensed to practice law in Minnesota
may serve as the chief unemployment law judge, senior unemployment law judges who are
supervisors, or unemployment law judges. The commissioner must designate a chief unemployment
law judge. The chief unemployment law judge may transfer to another unemployment law judge
any proceedings pending before an unemployment law judge.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Request for reconsideration. (a) Any involved applicant, involved employer, or
the commissioner may, within 20 calendar days of the sending of the unemployment law judge's
decision under subdivision 1, file a request for reconsideration asking the unemployment law judge
to reconsider that decision. Section 268.103 applies to a request for reconsideration. If a request for
reconsideration is timely filed, the unemployment law judge must issue an order:
   (1) modifying the findings of fact and decision issued under subdivision 1;
                          ­n

an additional evidentiary hearing be conducted under subdivision 1; or
   (3) affirming the findings of fact and decision issued under subdivision 1.
    (b) Upon a timely request for reconsideration having been filed, the department must send a
notice, by mail or electronic transmission, to all involved parties that a request for reconsideration
has been filed. The notice must inform the involved parties:
    (1) of the opportunity to provide comment on the request for reconsideration, and the right
under subdivision 5 to obtain a copy of any recorded testimony and exhibits offered or received
into evidence at the evidentiary hearing;
   (2) that providing specific comments as to a perceived factual or legal error in the decision, or a
perceived error in procedure during the evidentiary hearing, will assist the unemployment law judge

in deciding the request for reconsideration;
   (3) of the right to obtain any comments and submissions provided by the other involved party
regarding the request for reconsideration; and
    (4) of the provisions of paragraph (c) regarding additional evidence.
This paragraph does not apply if paragraph (d) is applicable.
    (c) In deciding a request for reconsideration, the unemployment law judge must not, except for
purposes of determining whether to order an additional evidentiary hearing, consider any evidence
that was not submitted at the evidentiary hearing conducted under subdivision 1.
    The unemployment law judge must order an additional evidentiary hearing if an involved party
shows that evidence which was not submitted at the evidentiary hearing: (1) would likely change
the outcome of the decision and there was good cause for not having previously submitted that
evidence; or (2) would show that the evidence that was submitted at the evidentiary hearing was
likely false and that the likely false evidence had an effect on the outcome of the decision.
    (d) If the involved applicant or involved employer who filed the request for reconsideration
failed to participate in the evidentiary hearing conducted under subdivision 1, an order setting aside

                          ­ decision and directing that an additional evidentiary hearing be conducted
must be issued if the party who failed to participate had good cause for failing to do so. In the notice
that a request for reconsideration has been filed, the party who failed to participate must be informed
of the requirement, and provided the opportunity, to show good cause for failing to participate. If the
unemployment law judge determines that good cause for failure to participate has not been shown,
the unemployment law judge must state that in the order issued under paragraph (a).
   Submission of a written statement at the evidentiary hearing under subdivision 1 does not
constitute participation for purposes of this paragraph.
   All involved parties must be informed of this paragraph with the notice of appeal and notice of
hearing provided for in subdivision 1.
   "Good cause" for purposes of this paragraph is a reason that would have prevented a reasonable
person acting with due diligence from participating at the evidentiary hearing.

judge.
    (f) The unemployment law judge must send to any involved applicant or involved employer,
by mail or electronic transmission, the order issued under this subdivision. An order modifying the
previously issued findings of fact and decision or an order affirming the previously issued findings
of fact and decision is the final department decision on the matter and is final and binding on the
involved applicant and involved employer unless judicial review is sought under subdivision 7.
    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
3822                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [46TH DAY

   Subd. 3a. Decisions. (a) If an unemployment law judge's decision or order allows unemployment
benefits to an applicant, the unemployment benefits must be paid regardless of any request for
reconsideration or any appeal to the Minnesota Court of Appeals having been filed.
    (b) If an unemployment law judge's decision or order modifies or reverses a determination, or
prior decision of the unemployment law judge, allowing unemployment benefits to an applicant,
any benefits paid in accordance with the determination, or prior decision of the unemployment law
judge, is considered an overpayment of those unemployment benefits. A decision or order issued
under this section that results in an overpayment of unemployment benefits must set out the amount
of the overpayment and the requirement under section 268.18, subdivision 1, that the overpaid
unemployment benefits must be repaid.
    (c) If an unemployment law judge's order under subdivision 2 allows unemployment benefits
to an applicant under section 268.095 because of a quit or discharge and the unemployment law
judge's decision is reversed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court of Minnesota,
the applicant cannot be held ineligible for any of the unemployment benefits paid the applicant and it
is not considered an overpayment of those unemployment benefits under section 268.18, subdivision
1. The effect of the court's reversal is the application of section 268.047, subdivision 3, in computing
the future tax rate of the employer.
    (d) If an unemployment law judge, under subdivision 2, orders the taking of additional evidence,
the unemployment law judge's prior decision must continue to be enforced until new findings of fact
and decision are made by the unemployment law judge.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Oaths; subpoenas. An unemployment law judge has authority to administer oaths
and affirmations, take depositions, and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and
the production of documents and other personal property considered necessary as evidence in
connection with the subject matter of an evidentiary hearing.
    The unemployment law judge must give full consideration to a request for a subpoena and
must not unreasonably deny a request for a subpoena. If a subpoena request is initially denied,
the unemployment law judge must, on the unemployment law judge's own motion, reconsider that
request during the evidentiary hearing and rule on whether the request was properly denied. If the
request was not properly denied, the evidentiary hearing must be continued for issuance of the
subpoena. The subpoenas are enforceable through the district court in Ramsey County. Witnesses
subpoenaed, other than an involved applicant or involved employer or officers and employees of
an involved employer, must be paid by the department the same witness fees as in a civil action in
district court.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.105, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Use of evidence; data privacy. (a) All testimony at any evidentiary hearing conducted
under subdivision 1 must be recorded. A copy of any recorded testimony and exhibits offered or
received into evidence at the hearing must, upon request, be furnished to a party at no cost during the
time period for filing a request for reconsideration or while a request for reconsideration is pending.
    (b) Regardless of any provision of law to the contrary, if recorded testimony and exhibits received
into evidence at the evidentiary hearing are not requested during the time period for filing a request

                     o­r while a request for reconsideration is pending, during the time for filing any
appeal under subdivision 7, or during the pendency thereof, that testimony and other evidence may
later be made available only under a district court order. A subpoena is not considered a district
court order.
    (c) Testimony obtained under subdivision 1, may not be used or considered for any purpose,
including impeachment, in any civil, administrative, or contractual proceeding, except by a local,
state, or federal human rights agency with enforcement powers, unless the proceeding is initiated
by the department.
    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.115, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Maximum amount of extended unemployment benefits. The maximum amount of
extended unemployment benefits available to an applicant is 50 percent of the maximum amount of
regular unemployment benefits available in the benefit year,

amounts deducted under this section. Federal income tax withholding has priority over state income
tax withholding.
   (c) An election to have income tax withheld may not be retroactive and only applies to
unemployment benefits paid after the election.
    Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.18, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Nonfraud overpayment. (a) Any applicant who (1) because of a determination or
amended determination issued under section 268.07 or 268.101, or any other section of this chapter,
or (2) because of an appeal decision or order under section 268.105, has received any unemployment
benefits that the applicant was held not entitled to, must promptly repay the unemployment benefits
to the trust fund.
    (b) If the applicant fails to repay the unemployment benefits overpaid, the commissioner may
offset from any future unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of the overpayment.
Except when the overpayment resulted because the applicant failed to report deductible earnings or
deductible or benefit delaying payments, no single offset may exceed 50 percent of the amount of
the payment from which the offset is made. The overpayment may also be collected by the ­         s­

    (c) If an applicant has been overpaid unemployment benefits under the law of another state,
because of a reason other than fraud, and that state certifies that the applicant is liable under its law
to repay the unemployment benefits and requests the commissioner to recover the overpayment,
the commissioner may offset from future unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of
overpayment, except that no single offset may exceed 50 percent of the amount of the payment from
which the offset is made.

under state and federal law. A determination of overpayment by fraud must state the methods of
collection the commissioner may use to recover the overpayment. Money received in repayment
of fraudulently obtained unemployment benefits, penalties, and interest is first applied to the
unemployment benefits overpaid, then to the penalty amount due, then to any interest due. 62.5
percent of the payments made toward the penalty are credited to the contingent account and 37.5
percent credited to the administration account ­ f­

   (d) If an applicant has been overpaid unemployment benefits under the law of another state
because of fraud and that state certifies that the applicant is liable to repay the unemployment benefits
and requests the commissioner to recover the overpayment, the commissioner may offset from future
unemployment benefits otherwise payable the amount of overpayment.
    (e) Unemployment benefits paid for weeks more than four years before the date of a
determination of overpayment by fraud issued under this subdivision are not considered overpaid
unemployment benefits.

     Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 268.211, is amended to read:
     268.211 UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS TELEPHONE SYSTEM.
    The commissioner must ensure that ­h  t­­e any automated telephone system used for unemployment
insurance benefits provides an option for any caller to speak to an unemployment insurance
specialist. An individual who calls any of the publicized telephone numbers seeking information

46TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                        3827

    It is in the public interest, as well as the interest of applicants and employees, that an
unemployment law judge conducting contested unemployment insurance hearings should be an
experienced attorney with a background in civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. An
unemployment law judge should have a level of skill equal to that of a workers' compensation judge.
In order to recruit and retain individuals with the appropriate skills, the pay of an unemployment
law judge should be commensurate with that of a workers' compensation judge, but should also
take into account the less formal nature of an unemployment insurance hearing. Before October
1, 2009, the commissioner of finance is directed, in consultation with the deputy commissioner
of employment and economic development and the chief unemployment law judge, to determine
and implement the appropriate pay level, with no more than two pay steps, for unemployment law
judges, giving consideration only to the pay level provided to workers' compensation judges, but
taking into account the less formal nature of an unemployment insurance hearing.
   Sec. 50. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
   In Minnesota Statutes, chapter 268, the revisor shall change "shall" to "must," except in
Minnesota Statutes, sections 268.035 and 268.103.
   Sec. 51. REPEALER.
    Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 268.085, subdivision 14; and 268.086, subdivisions 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, are repealed.
   Sec. 52. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Sections 1 to 48 and 50 are effective August 2, 2009, and apply to all department determinations
and unemployment law judge decisions issued on or after that date.
                                            ARTICLE 5
               LABOR STANDARDS AND WAGES; LICENSING AND FEES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16C.28, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Contract awards. When prevailing wage laws apply, an agency shall not be liable for
costs under section 177.43, subdivision 3, if it has included language in its contracts which requires
vendors and contractors to comply with prevailing wage laws and the contract also contains the
following elements:
   (1) a description of the prevailing wage laws and a citation to relevant statutes;
   (2) contact details for further information from the Department of Labor and Industry; and
   (3) a statement of contractor and subcontractor liability for failure to adhere to prevailing wage
laws.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 177.27, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Compliance orders. The commissioner may issue an order requiring an employer
to comply with sections 177.21 to 177.435, 181.02, 181.03, 181.031, 181.032, 181.101, 181.11,
181.12, 181.13, 181.14, 181.145, 181.15, 181.275, subdivision 2a, and 181.79, or with any rule
promulgated under section 177.28. The commissioner shall issue an order requiring an employer to

comply with sections 177.41 to 177.435 if the violation is repeated. For purposes of this subdivision
only, a violation is repeated if at any time during the two years that preceded the date of violation,
the commissioner issued an order to the employer for violation of sections 177.41 to 177.435 and
the order is final or the commissioner and the employer have entered into a settlement agreement
that required the employer to pay back wages that were required by sections 177.41 to 177.435. The
department shall serve the order upon the employer or the employer's authorized representative in
person or by certified mail at the employer's place of business. An employer who wishes to contest
the order must file written notice of objection to the order with the commissioner within 15 calendar
days after being served with the order. A contested case proceeding must then be held in accordance
with sections 14.57 to 14.69. If, within 15 calendar days after being served with the order, the
employer fails to file a written notice of objection with the commissioner, the order becomes a final
order of the commissioner.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 177.30, is amended to read:
    177.30 KEEPING RECORDS; PENALTY.
    (a) Every employer subject to sections 177.21 to 177.44 must make and keep a record of:
    (1) the name, address, and occupation of each employee;
    (2) the rate of pay, and the amount paid each pay period to each employee;
    (3) the hours worked each day and each workweek by the employee;
    (4) for each employer subject to sections 177.41 to 177.44, and while performing work on public
works projects funded in whole or in part with state funds, the employer shall furnish under oath
signed by an owner or officer of an employer to the contracting authority and the project owner every
two weeks, a certified payroll report with respect to the wages and benefits paid each employee
during the preceding weeks specifying for each employee: name; identifying number; prevailing
wage master job classification ­o­

employee works except each employer subject to sections 177.41 to 177.44, and while performing
work on public works projects funded in whole or in part with state funds, the records must be kept
for three years after the contracting authority has made final payment on the public works project.
    (b) The commissioner may fine an employer up to $1,000 for each failure to maintain records
as required by this section. This penalty is in addition to any penalties provided under section
177.32, subdivision 1. In determining the amount of a civil penalty under this subdivision, the
appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the employer's business and the gravity of the violation
shall be considered.

government license or permit suspended or revoked as a result of an action brought by a federal or
state governmental agency in this or any other state within the last five years; and

fee established by subdivision 7a. "Sales documents" mean only the safety feature disclosure form
defined in section 327C.07, subdivision 3a, title of the home, financing agreements, and purchase
agreements.
   The license holder shall, upon request of the commissioner, make available for inspection during
business hours sales documents required to be retained under this subdivision.

reasonable basis for believing that a person has engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of a
statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the board or
complaint committee may proceed as provided in subdivision 2 or 3. Except as otherwise provided
in this section, all hearings must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Subd. 2. Legal actions. (a) When necessary to prevent an imminent violation of a statute, rule,
or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the board, or a complaint
committee if authorized by the board, may bring an action in the name of the state in the District
Court of Ramsey County in which jurisdiction is proper to enjoin the act or practice and to enforce
compliance with the statute, rule, or order. On a showing that a person has engaged in or is about
to engage in an act or practice that constitutes a violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board
has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce, the court shall grant a permanent or temporary
injunction, restraining order, or other appropriate relief.
    (b) For purposes of injunctive relief under this subdivision, irreparable harm exists when the
board shows that a person has engaged in or is about to engage in an act or practice that constitutes
violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce.
    (c) Injunctive relief granted under paragraph (a) does not relieve an enjoined person from
criminal prosecution by a competent authority, or from action by the board under subdivision 3, 4,
5, or 6 with respect to the person's license or registration, or application for examination, license,
registration, or renewal.
    Subd. 3. Cease and desist orders. (a) The board, or complaint committee if authorized by
the board, may issue and have served upon an unlicensed or unregistered person, or a holder of
a license or registration, an order requiring the person to cease and desist from an act or practice
that constitutes a violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is
empowered to enforce. The order must (1) give reasonable notice of the rights of the person named
in the order to request a hearing, and (2) state the reasons for the entry of the order. No order may

be issued under this subdivision until an investigation of the facts has been conducted under section
214.10.
    (b) Service of the order under this subdivision is effective when the order is personally served
on the person or counsel of record, or served by certified mail to the most recent address provided
to the board for the person or counsel of record.
    (c) The board must hold a hearing under this subdivision not later than 30 days after the board
receives the request for the hearing, unless otherwise agreed between the board, or complaint
committee if authorized by the board, and the person requesting the hearing.
    (d) Notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, the administrative law judge must issue a report
within 30 days of the close of the contested case hearing. Within 30 days after receiving the report
and subsequent exceptions and argument, the board shall issue a further order vacating, modifying,
or making permanent the cease and desist order. If no hearing is requested within 30 days of service
of the order, the order becomes final and remains in effect until modified or vacated by the board.
    Subd. 4. Licensing and registration actions. (a) With respect to a person who is a holder of
or applicant for a license or registration under this chapter, the board may by order deny, refuse to
renew, suspend, temporarily suspend, or revoke the application, license, or registration, censure or
reprimand the person, refuse to permit the person to sit for examination, or refuse to release the
person's examination grades, if the board finds that such an order is in the public interest and that,
based on a preponderance of the evidence presented, the person has:
   (1) violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to
enforce;
    (2) engaged in conduct or acts that are fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest, whether or not the
conduct or acts relate to the practice of a profession regulated by this chapter, if the fraudulent,
deceptive, or dishonest conduct or acts reflect adversely on the person's ability or fitness to engage
in the practice of the profession;
   (3) engaged in conduct or acts that constitute malpractice, are negligent, demonstrate
incompetence, or are otherwise in violation of the standards in the rules of the board, where the

determined may result or may have resulted in an immediate threat to the public.
    (b) In lieu of or in addition to any remedy under paragraph (a), the board may, as a condition
of continued licensure or registration, termination of suspension, reinstatement of licensure or
registration, examination, or release of examination results, require that the person:
  (1) submit to a quality review of the person's ability, skills, or quality of work, conducted in a

be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Subd. 5. Temporary suspension. (a) When the board, or complaint committee if authorized by
the board, issues a temporary suspension order, the suspension provided for in the order is effective
on service of a written copy of the order on the licensee, registrant, or counsel of record. The order

board and the licensee or registrant.
    (b) An order under this subdivision may (1) prohibit the licensee or registrant from engaging in

    (c) Within ten days after service of an order under this subdivision, the licensee or registrant
may request a hearing in writing. The board must hold a hearing before its own members within
five working days of the request for a hearing. The sole issue at the hearing must be whether there
is a reasonable basis to continue, modify, or terminate the temporary suspension. The hearing is
not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Evidence presented to the board or the licensee or
registrant may be in affidavit form only. The licensee, registrant, or counsel of record may appear
for oral argument.
    (d) Within five working days after the hearing, the board shall issue its order and, if the order

order within 30 days of receiving the report.
    Subd. 6. Violations; penalties; costs. (a) The board may impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000

board for all or part of the cost of (1) the proceedings resulting in disciplinary action authorized
under this section, (2) the imposition of a civil penalty under paragraph (a), or (3) the issuance of
a cease and desist order. The board may impose a fee under this paragraph when the board shows
that the position of the person who has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or
issued or is empowered to enforce is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make
such a fee unjust, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary. Costs under this paragraph include, but
are not limited to, the amount paid by the board for services from the Office of Administrative
Hearings, attorney fees, court reporter costs, witness costs, reproduction of records, board members'
compensation, board staff time, and expenses incurred by board members and staff.

its sole discretion place any conditions on reinstatement of a suspended, revoked, or surrendered
license or registration that it finds appropriate and necessary to ensure that the purposes of this
chapter are met. No license or registration may be reinstated until the former licensee or registrant
has completed at least one-half of the suspension period.

city and by the city to the commissioner. The

payments may include operating revenues
and additional payments to be made by the
lessee under agreements to be negotiated
between the commissioner, the city, and the
lessee. Those agreements may include, but
are not limited to, an agreement whereby the
lessee pledges to provide each year a letter
of credit sufficient to guarantee the payment
of the amount due for the next succeeding
year; an agreement whereby the lessee agrees
to maintain a net worth, certified each year
by a financial institution or accounting
firm satisfactory to the commissioner, that
is greater than the balance due under the
payment schedule in paragraph (a); and any
other agreements the commissioner may
deem necessary to ensure that the payments
are made as scheduled. Payments made by
the lessee under the lease in amounts equal to
the amount of the loan forgiven after year 12
must be used solely by the city to pay for or
finance the design, acquisition, construction,
and equipping of a public facility to be located
within the block 39/arena tax increment
district.
(d) The agreements must provide that the
failure of the lessee to make a payment due
to the city under the agreement is an event
of default under the lease between the city
and the lessee and that the state is entitled to
enforce the remedies of the lessor under the
lease in the event of default. Those remedies
must include, but need not be limited to, the
obligation of the lessee to pay the balance due
for the remainder of the payment schedule
in the event the lessee ceases to operate a
National Hockey League team in the arena.
(e) By January 1, 1999, the commissioner
shall report to the chair of the senate
committee on state government finance
and the chair of the house committee on
ways and means the terms of an agreement
between the lessee and the amateur sports
commission whereby the lessee agrees to
make the facilities of the arena available
to the commission on terms satisfactory to

the commission for amateur sports activities
consistent with the purposes of Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 240A, each year during the
time the loan is outstanding. The amateur
sports commission must negotiate in good
faith and may be required to pay no more
than actual out-of-pocket expenses for the
time it uses the arena. The agreement may not
become effective before February 1, 1999.
During any calendar year after 1999 that an
agreement under this paragraph is not in effect
and a payment is due under the schedule, the
lessee must pay to the commissioner a penalty
of $750,000 for that year. If the amateur
sports commission has not negotiated in good
faith, no penalty is due.

relief to those areas of the taconite assistance area as defined in section 273.1341, that have the largest
percentages of job losses and population losses directly attributable to the economic downturn in
the taconite industry since the 1980s. The commissioner and the board shall compare the 1980
population and employment figures with the 2000 population and employment figures, and shall
specifically consider the job losses in 2000 and 2001 resulting from the closure of LTV Steel Mining
Company, in making or approving expenditures consistent with this subdivision, as well as the areas
of residence of persons who suffered job loss for which relief is to be targeted under this subdivision.

    Funds for the purposes of this section are provided by section 298.28, subdivision 11, relating
to the taconite area environmental protection fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 298.227, is amended to read:
   298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    (a) An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production
and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of
the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that producer.
The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each local
employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the employee
committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees. The review
must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal for expenditure
of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be released only for
workforce development and associated public facility improvement, or for acquisition of plant
and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or for research and development
in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology, but only if the
producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at least 50 percent
of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with distributions in 2002. Effective for
proposals for expenditures of money from the fund beginning May 26, 2007, the commissioner
may not release the funds before the next scheduled meeting of the board. If ­h      t­­ ­­

proposed expenditure is not approved by at least seven Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation
Board members, the funds must be deposited in the Taconite Environmental Protection Fund under
sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a producer uses money which has been released from the fund prior
to May 26, 2007 to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and the producer
removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134 within
ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a portion of the money granted from
the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development fund. The portion of the money
to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed from the taconite tax relief
area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund, declining by ten percent for each
of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains within the taconite tax relief
area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the facility had ceased, any money
remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to the purchaser of the facility on the
terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this section. If a producer fails to provide

matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months after the commissioner approves
release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another producer in proportion to the
distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any portion of the fund which is not
released by the commissioner within one year of its deposit in the fund shall be divided between
the taconite environmental protection fund created in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson
economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292 for placement in their respective special
accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds shall be distributed to the taconite environmental
protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund.
    (b)(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), setting the amount of distributions
and the review process, an amount equal to ten cents per taxable ton of production in 2007, for
distribution in 2008 only, that would otherwise be distributed under paragraph (a), may be used for a
loan for the cost of construction of a biomass energy facility. This amount must be deducted from the
distribution under paragraph (a) for which a matching expenditure by the producer is not required.

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 298.292, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Use of money. Money in the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund may
be used for the following purposes:
    (1) to provide loans, loan guarantees, interest buy-downs and other forms of participation with
private sources of financing, but a loan to a private enterprise shall be for a principal amount not
to exceed one-half of the cost of the project for which financing is sought, and the rate of interest
on a loan to a private enterprise shall be no less than the lesser of eight percent or an interest rate
three percentage points less than a full faith and credit obligation of the United States government
of comparable maturity, at the time that the loan is approved;
    (2) to fund reserve accounts established to secure the payment when due of the principal of and
interest on bonds issued pursuant to section 298.2211;
    (3) to pay in periodic payments or in a lump-sum payment any or all of the interest on bonds
issued pursuant to chapter 474 for the purpose of constructing, converting, or retrofitting heating
facilities in connection with district heating systems or systems utilizing alternative energy sources;
     (4) to invest in a venture capital fund or enterprise that will provide capital to other entities that
are engaging in, or that will engage in, projects or programs that have the purposes set forth in
subdivision 1. No investments may be made in a venture capital fund or enterprise unless at least
two other unrelated investors make investments of at least $500,000 in the venture capital fund or
enterprise, and the investment by the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund may not
exceed the amount of the largest investment by an unrelated investor in the venture capital fund or
enterprise. For purposes of this subdivision, an "unrelated investor" is a person or entity that is not

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327C.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 6. Payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. In the event a
park owner has been assessed under section 327C.095, subdivision 12, paragraph (c), the park owner
may collect the $12 annual payment required by section 327C.095, subdivision 12, for participation
in the relocation trust fund, as a lump sum or, along with monthly lot rent, a fee of no more than $1
per month to cover the cost of participating in the relocation trust fund. The $1 fee must be separately
itemized and clearly labeled "Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund."
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327C.095, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. (a) If
a manufactured home owner is required to move due to the conversion of all or a portion of a
manufactured home park to another use, the closure of a park, or cessation of use of the land as
a manufactured home park, the manufactured park owner shall, upon the change in use, pay to
the commissioner of finance for deposit in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust
fund under section 462A.35, the lesser amount of the actual costs of moving or purchasing the
manufactured home approved by the neutral third party and paid by the Minnesota Housing Finance
Agency under subdivision 13, paragraph (a) or (e), or $3,250 for each single section manufactured
home, and $6,000 for each multisection manufactured home, for which a manufactured home
owner has made application for payment of relocation costs under subdivision 13, paragraph
(c). The manufactured home park owner shall make payments required under this section to the
Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund within 60 days of receipt of invoice from the
neutral third party.
   (b) A manufactured home park owner is not required to make the payment prescribed under
paragraph (a), nor is a manufactured home owner entitled to compensation under subdivision 13,
paragraph (a) or (e), if:
    (1) the manufactured home park owner relocates the manufactured home owner to another space
in the manufactured home park or to another manufactured home park at the park owner's expense;
   (2) the manufactured home owner is vacating the premises and has informed the manufactured

assess each manufactured home park owner by mail the total amount of $12 for each licensed lot
in their park, payable on or before September 15 of each year. The commissioner of finance shall
deposit the payments in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. On or before July
15 of each year, the commissioner of finance shall prepare and distribute to park owners a letter
explaining the collection, an invoice for all licensed lots, and a sample form for the park owners to
collect information on which park residents have been accounted for. The park owner may recoup
the cost of the $12 assessment as a lump sum or as a monthly fee of no more than $1 collected
from park residents together with monthly lot rent as provided in section 327C.03, subdivision 6.
Park owners may adjust payment for lots in their park that are vacant or otherwise not eligible for
contribution to the trust fund under section 327C.095, subdivision 12, paragraph (b), and deduct
from the assessment, accordingly.
   (d) This subdivision and subdivision 13, paragraph (c), clause (5), are enforceable by the
neutral third party, on behalf of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, or by action in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction. The court may award a prevailing party reasonable attorney fees, court
costs, and disbursements.

home park to another use, the closure of a manufactured home park, or cessation of use of the land
as a manufactured home park under subdivision 1, and the manufactured home owner complies
with the requirements of this section, the manufactured home owner is entitled to payment from
the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund equal to the manufactured home owner's
actual relocation costs for relocating the manufactured home to a new location within a 25-mile
radius of the park that is being closed, up to a maximum of $4,000 for a single-section and $8,000
for a multisection manufactured home. The actual relocation costs must include the reasonable cost
of taking down, moving, and setting up the manufactured home, including equipment rental, utility
connection and disconnection charges, minor repairs, modifications necessary for transportation of
the home, necessary moving permits and insurance, moving costs for any appurtenances, which
meet applicable local, state, and federal building and construction codes.
   (b) A manufactured home owner is not entitled to compensation under paragraph (a) if the
manufactured home park owner is not required to make a payment to the Minnesota manufactured
home relocation trust fund under subdivision 12, paragraph (b).
   (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e), in order to obtain payment from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, the manufactured home owner shall submit to the
neutral third party and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, with a copy to the park owner, an
application for payment, which includes:
   (1) a copy of the closure statement under subdivision 1;
   (2) a copy of the contract with a moving or towing contractor, which includes the relocation
costs for relocating the manufactured home;
   (3) a statement with supporting materials of any additional relocation costs as outlined in
subdivision 1;
   (4) a statement certifying that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under
subdivision 12, paragraph (b), apply to the manufactured home owner;
    (5) a statement from the manufactured park owner that the lot rental is current and that the annual
$12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been paid when due;
and
   (6) a statement from the county where the manufactured home is located certifying that personal
property taxes for the manufactured home are paid through the end of that year.
    (d) If the neutral third party has acted reasonably and does not approve or deny payment within
45 days after receipt of the information set forth in paragraph (c), the payment is deemed approved.
Upon approval and request by the neutral third party, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall
issue two checks in equal amount for 50 percent of the contract price payable to the mover and
towing contractor for relocating the manufactured home in the amount of the actual relocation cost,
plus a check to the home owner for additional certified costs associated with third-party vendors,
that were necessary in relocating the manufactured home. The moving or towing contractor shall
receive 50 percent upon execution of the contract and 50 percent upon completion of the relocation
and approval by the manufactured home owner. The moving or towing contractor may not apply
the funds to any other purpose other than relocation of the manufactured home as provided in the
contract. A copy of the approval must be forwarded by the neutral third party to the park owner with

an invoice for payment of the amount specified in subdivision 12, paragraph (a).
     (e) In lieu of collecting a relocation payment from the Minnesota manufactured home relocation
trust fund under paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner may collect an amount from the fund
after reasonable efforts to relocate the manufactured home have failed due to the age or condition of
the manufactured home, or because there are no manufactured home parks willing or able to accept
the manufactured home within a 25-mile radius. A manufactured home owner may tender title of
the manufactured home in the manufactured home park to the manufactured home park owner, and
collect an amount to be determined by an independent appraisal. The appraiser must be agreed to
by both the manufactured home park owner and the manufactured home owner. The amount that
may be reimbursed under the fund is a maximum of $5,000 for a single section and $9,000 for a
multisection manufactured home. The manufactured home owner shall deliver to the manufactured
home park owner the current certificate of title to the manufactured home duly endorsed by the
owner of record, and valid releases of all liens shown on the certificate of title, and a statement from
the county where the manufactured home is located evidencing that the personal property taxes have
been paid. The manufactured home owner's application for funds under this paragraph must include
a document certifying that the manufactured home cannot be relocated, that the lot rental is current,
that the annual $12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been
paid when due, that the manufactured home owner has chosen to tender title under this section,
and that the park owner agrees to make a payment to the commissioner of finance in the amount
established in subdivision 12, paragraph (a), less any documented costs submitted to the neutral
third party, required for demolition and removal of the home, and any debris or refuse left on the
lot, not to exceed $1,000. The manufactured home owner must also provide a copy of the certificate
of title endorsed by the owner of record, and certify to the neutral third party, with a copy to the
park owner, that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under subdivision 12, paragraph
(b), clauses (1) to (6), apply to the manufactured home owner, and that the home owner will vacate
the home within 60 days after receipt of payment or the date of park closure, whichever is earlier,
provided that the monthly lot rent is kept current.
    (f) The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency must make a determination of the amount of
payment a manufactured home owner would have been entitled to under a local ordinance in effect
on May 26, 2007. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner's compensation
for relocation costs from the fund under section 462A.35, is the greater of the amount provided
under this subdivision, or the amount under the local ordinance in effect on May 26, 2007, that is
applicable to the manufactured home owner. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to increase the
liability of the park owner.
    (g) Neither the neutral third party nor the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall be liable
to any person for recovery if the funds in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund
are insufficient to pay the amounts claimed. The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall keep a
record of the time and date of its approval of payment to a claimant.
    (h) The agency shall report to the chairs of the senate Finance Committee and house of
representatives Ways and Means Committee by January 15 of each year on the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, including the account balance, payments to claimants,
the amount of any advances to the fund, ­

fund balance. If sufficient funds become available, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall

pay the manufactured home owner whose unpaid claim is the earliest by time and date of approval.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462A.05, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Rehabilitation loans. It may agree to purchase, make, or otherwise participate in the
making, and may enter into commitments for the purchase, making, or participation in the making,
of eligible loans for rehabilitation, with terms and conditions as the agency deems advisable, to
persons and families of low and moderate income, and to owners of existing residential housing
for occupancy by such persons and families, for the rehabilitation of existing residential housing
owned by them. The loans may be insured or uninsured and may be made with security, or may be
unsecured, as the agency deems advisable. The loans may be in addition to or in combination with
long-term eligible mortgage loans under subdivision 3. They may be made in amounts sufficient
to refinance existing indebtedness secured by the property, if refinancing is determined by the
agency to be necessary to permit the owner to meet the owner's housing cost without expending
an unreasonable portion of the owner's income thereon. No loan for rehabilitation shall be made
unless the agency determines that the loan will be used primarily to make the housing more
desirable to live in, to increase the market value of the housing, for compliance with state, county
or municipal building, housing maintenance, fire, health or similar codes and standards applicable
to housing, or to accomplish energy conservation related improvements. In unincorporated areas
and municipalities not having codes and standards, the agency may, solely for the purpose of
administering the provisions of this chapter, establish codes and standards. Except for accessibility
improvements under this subdivision and subdivisions 14a and 24, clause (1), no secured loan for
rehabilitation of any owner-occupied property shall be made in an amount which, with all other
existing indebtedness secured by the property, would exceed 110 percent of its market value, as
determined by the agency. No loan under this subdivision for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied
housing shall be denied solely because the loan will not be used for placing the owner-occupied
residential housing in full compliance with all state, county, or municipal building, housing
maintenance, fire, health, or similar codes and standards applicable to housing. Rehabilitation loans
shall be made only when the agency determines that financing is not otherwise available, in whole
or in part, from private lenders upon equivalent terms and conditions. Accessibility rehabilitation
loans authorized under this subdivision may be made to eligible persons and families without
limitations relating to the maximum incomes of the borrowers if:
    (1) the borrower or a member of the borrower's family requires a level of care provided in
a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities;
   (2) home care is appropriate; and
    (3) the improvement will enable the borrower or a member of the borrower's family to reside in
the housing.
The agency may waive any requirement that the housing units in a residential housing development
be rented to persons of low and moderate income if the development consists of four or less dwelling
units, one of which is occupied by the owner.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 462A.05, subdivision 14a, is amended to read:

existing residential housing owned and occupied by those persons or families. No loan shall be
made unless the agency determines that the loan will be used primarily for rehabilitation work
necessary for health or safety, essential accessibility improvements, or to improve the energy
efficiency of the dwelling. No loan for rehabilitation of owner occupied residential housing
shall be denied solely because the loan will not be used for placing the residential housing in
full compliance with all state, county or municipal building, housing maintenance, fire, health
or similar codes and standards applicable to housing. The amount of any loan shall not exceed
the lesser of (a) a maximum loan amount determined under rules adopted by the agency not to
exceed ­$2

cost of rehabilitation which the agency determines cannot otherwise be paid by the person or
family without the expenditure of an unreasonable portion of the income of the person or family.
Loans made in whole or in part with federal funds may exceed the maximum loan amount to the
extent necessary to comply with federal lead abatement requirements prescribed by the funding
source. In making loans, the agency shall determine the circumstances under which and the terms
and conditions under which all or any portion of the loan will be repaid and shall determine the
appropriate security for the repayment of the loan. Loans pursuant to this subdivision may be made
with or without interest or periodic payments.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 580.07, is amended to read:
   580.07 POSTPONEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Postponement by mortgagee. The sale may be postponed, from time to time,
by the party conducting the foreclosure, by inserting a notice of the postponement, as soon as
practicable, in the newspaper in which the original advertisement was published, at the expense
of the party requesting the postponement. The notice shall be published only once.
    Subd. 2. Postponement by mortgagor or owner. (a) If all or a part of the property to be sold is
classified as homestead under section 273.124 and contains one to four dwelling units, the mortgagor
or owner may postpone the sale to the first date that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday and is
five months after the originally scheduled date of sale in the manner provided in this subdivision. To
postpone a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision, at any time after the first publication of the
notice of mortgage foreclosure sale under section 580.03 but at least 15 days prior to the scheduled
sale date specified in that notice, the mortgagor shall: (1) execute a sworn affidavit in the form set
forth in subdivision 3, (2) record the affidavit in the office of each county recorder and registrar
of titles where the mortgage was recorded, and (3) file with the sheriff conducting the sale and
deliver to the attorney foreclosing the mortgage, a copy of the recorded affidavit, showing the date
and office in which the affidavit was recorded. Recording of the affidavit and postponement of the
foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision shall automatically reduce the mortgagor's redemption
period under section 580.23 to five weeks. The postponement of a foreclosure sale pursuant to this
subdivision does not require any change in the contents of the notice of sale, service of the notice of
sale if the occupant was served with the notice of sale prior to postponement under this subdivision,
or publication of the notice of sale if publication was commenced prior to postponement under this
subdivision, notwithstanding the service and publication time periods specified in section 580.03,
but the sheriff's certificate of sale shall indicate the actual date of the foreclosure sale and the actual
length of the mortgagor's redemption period. No notice of postponement need be published. An
affidavit complying with subdivision 3 shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, and
shall be entitled to be recorded. The right to postpone a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subdivision
may be exercised only once, regardless whether the mortgagor reinstates the mortgage prior to the
postponed mortgage foreclosure sale.

    (b) If the automatic stay under United States Code, title 11, section 362, applies to the mortgage
foreclosure after a mortgagor or owner requests postponement of the sheriff's sale under this
section, then when the automatic stay is no longer applicable, the mortgagor's or owner's election to
shorten the redemption period to five weeks under this section remains applicable to the mortgage
foreclosure.

following form and shall contain all of the following information.

     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 129D.155, is amended to read:
     129D.155 REPAYMENT OF FUNDS.
      State funds distributed to public television or noncommercial radio stations and used to purchase
equipment assets must be repaid to the state, without interest, if the assets purchased with these funds
are sold within five years or otherwise converted to a person other than a nonprofit or municipal
corporation. The amount due to the state shall be the net amount realized from the sale of the
assets, but shall not exceed the amount of state funds advanced for the purchase of the asset. P                           ­u­­

    (e) Failure to pay the fee is sufficient cause for revoking a permit. A penalty of two percent
per month calculated from the original due date must be imposed on the unpaid balance of fees

an agency, as defined in section 16B.01, subdivision 2, or federal governmental agency holding a
water appropriation permit.

                          ­ $30 per million gallons in addition to the fee prescribed in paragraph (a)
shall be applied to the volume of water used in each of the months of June, July, and August that
exceeds the volume of water used in January for municipal water use, irrigation of golf courses, and
landscape irrigation. The surcharge for municipalities with more than one permit shall be determined
based on the total appropriations from all permits that supply a common distribution system.

    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103G.301, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Field inspection fees. (a) In addition to the application fee, the commissioner may
charge a field inspection fee for:
    (1) projects requiring a mandatory environmental assessment under chapter 116D;
    (2) projects undertaken without a required permit or application; and
    (3) projects undertaken in excess of limitations established in an issued permit.
    (b) The fee must be at least $100 but not more than actual inspection costs.
   (c) The fee is to cover actual costs related to a permit applied for under this chapter or for a
project undertaken without proper authorization.
    (d) The commissioner shall establish a schedule of field inspection fees under section 16A.1285.
The schedule must include actual costs related to field inspection, including investigations of the
area affected by the proposed activity, analysis of the proposed activity, consultant services, and
subsequent monitoring, if any, of the activity authorized by the permit. Fees collected under this
subdivision must be credited to an account in the natural resources fund and are appropriated to the
commissioner.
    Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 115.03, subdivision 5c, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5c. Regulation of storm water discharges. (a) The agency may issue a general permit to
any category or subcategory of point source storm water discharges that it deems administratively
reasonable and efficient without making any findings under agency rules. Nothing in this subdivision
precludes the agency from requiring an individual permit for a point source storm water discharge
if the agency finds that it is appropriate under applicable legal or regulatory standards.
   (b) Pursuant to this paragraph, the legislature authorizes the agency to adopt and enforce rules
regulating point source storm water discharges. No further legislative approval is required under
any other legal or statutory provision whether enacted before or after May 29, 2003.
    (c) The agency shall develop performance standards, design standards, or other tools to enable
and promote the implementation of low-impact development and other storm water management
techniques. For the purposes of this section, "low-impact development" means an approach to
storm water management that mimics a site's natural hydrology as the landscape is developed.
Using the low-impact development approach, storm water is managed on-site and the rate and
volume of predevelopment storm water reaching receiving waters is unchanged. The calculation of
predevelopment hydrology is based on native soil and vegetation.

Control Agency:
    (1) for the purpose of implementing sections 115A.1312 to 115A.1330, including transfer to the
commissioner of revenue to carry out the department's duties under section 115A.1320, subdivision
2, and transfer to the commissioner of administration for responsibilities under section 115A.1324;
and
    (2) to the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency to be distributed on a competitive basis
through contracts with counties outside the 11-county metropolitan area, as defined in paragraph
(c), and with private entities that collect for recycling covered electronic devices in counties
outside the 11-county metropolitan area, where the collection and recycling is consistent with the
respective county's solid waste plan, for the purpose of carrying out the activities under sections
115A.1312 to 115A.1330. In awarding competitive grants under this clause, the commissioner must
give preference to counties and private entities that are working cooperatively with manufacturers
to help them meet their recycling obligations under section 115A.1318, subdivision 1.
   (c) The 11-county metropolitan area consists of the counties of Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota,
Hennepin, Isanti, Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne, Washington, and Wright.
     Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 115A.557, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Distribution; formula. Any funds appropriated to the commissioner for the
purpose of distribution to counties under this section must be distributed each fiscal year by the
commissioner based on population, except a county may not receive less than $55,000 in a fiscal
year. If the amount available for distribution under this section is less or more than the amount
available in fiscal year 2001, the minimum county payment under this section is reduced or increased
proportionately. For purposes of this subdivision, "population" has the definition given in section
477A.011, subdivision 3. A county that participates in a multicounty district that manages solid
waste and that has responsibility for recycling programs as authorized in section 115A.552, must
pass through to the districts funds received by the county in excess of the minimum county payment
under this section in proportion to the population of the county served by that district.
     Sec. 43. [115A.559] COMPOSTING COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Grant program established. The commissioner shall make competitive grants to
political subdivisions to increase composting, reduce the amount of organic wastes entering disposal
facilities, and reduce the costs associated with hauling waste by locating the composting site as close
as possible to the site where the waste is generated. To achieve the purpose of the grant program, the
commissioner shall actively recruit potential applicants beyond traditional solid waste professionals
and organizations, such as soil and water conservation districts and schools. Each grant must include
an educational component on the methods and benefits of composting.

   Subd. 2. Application. (a) The commissioner must develop forms and procedures for soliciting
and reviewing applications for grants under this section.
    (b) The determination of whether to make a grant under this section is within the discretion of
the commissioner, subject to subdivision 4. The commissioner's decisions are not subject to judicial
review, except for abuse of discretion.
   Subd. 3. Priorities; eligible projects. (a) If applications for grants exceed the available
appropriations, grants must be made for projects that, in the commissioner's judgment, provide the
highest return in public benefits.
   (b) To be eligible to receive a grant, a project must:
   (1) be locally administered;
   (2) have measurable outcomes; and
   (3) include at least one of the following elements:
   (i) the development of erosion control methods that use compost;
   (ii) activities to encourage on-site composting by homeowners; or
   (iii) activities to encourage composting by schools or public institutions.
   Subd. 4. Cancellation of grant. If a grant is awarded under this section and funds are not
encumbered for the grant within four years after the award date, the grant must be canceled.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 115A.931, is amended to read:
   115A.931 YARD WASTE PROHIBITION.
    (a) Except as authorized by the agency, in the metropolitan area after January 1, 1990, and outside
the metropolitan area after January 1, 1992, a person may not place yard waste:
   (1) in mixed municipal solid waste;
   (2) in a disposal facility; or
   (3) in a resource recovery facility except for the purposes of reuse, composting, or cocomposting.
   (b) [Renumbered 115A.03, subd 38]
    (c) On or after January 1, 2010, a person may not place yard waste or source-separated
compostable materials generated in a metropolitan county in a plastic bag delivered to a transfer
station or compost facility unless the bag meets all the specifications in ASTM Standard
Specification for Compostable Plastics (D6400). For purposes of this paragraph, "metropolitan
county" has the meaning given in section 473.121, subdivision 4, and "ASTM" has the meaning
given in section 296A.01, subdivision 6.
   (d) A person who immediately empties a plastic bag containing yard waste or source-separated
compostable materials delivered to a transfer station or compost facility and removes the plastic bag
from the transfer station or compost facility is exempt from paragraph (c).

    (e) Residents of a city of the first class that currently contracts for the collection of yard waste
are exempt from paragraph (c) until January 1, 2013, if, by that date, the city implements a citywide
source-separated compostable materials collection program using durable carts.

   Subdivision 1. Conditions. (a) The agency shall not require feedlot permittees to maintain
records as to rainfall or snowfall as a condition of a general feedlot permit if the owner directs the

government agency or educational institution.
   (b) A feedlot permittee shall give notice to the agency when the permittee proposes to transfer
ownership or control of the feedlot to a new party. The commissioner shall not unreasonably
withhold or unreasonably delay approval of any transfer request. This request shall be handled in

a permit from the agency or county, regardless of the number of years that the feedlot was unused.
   Subd. 2. County feedlot program grants; three-part formula. (a) Money appropriated to the
commissioner to make grants to delegated counties to administer the county feedlot program must
be distributed according to the three-part formula in paragraphs (b) to (d).
   (b) Number of feedlots in the county: 60 percent of the total appropriation must be distributed
according to the number of feedlots that are required to be registered in the county. Grants awarded
under this paragraph must be matched with a combination of local cash and in-kind contributions.
    (c) Minimum program requirements: 25 percent of the total appropriation must be distributed
based on the county (1) conducting an annual number of inspections at feedlots that is equal
to or greater than seven percent of the total number of registered feedlots that are required to
be registered in the county; and (2) meeting noninspection minimum program requirements
as identified in the county feedlot workplan form. Counties that do not meet the inspection
requirement must not receive 50 percent of the eligible funding under this paragraph. Counties
must receive funding for noninspection requirements under this paragraph according to a scoring
system checklist administered by the commissioner. The commissioner, in consultation with the
Minnesota Association of County Feedlot Officers executive team, shall make a final decision
regarding any appeal by a county regarding the terms and conditions of this paragraph.

   (d) Performance credits: 15 percent of the total appropriation must be distributed according to
work that has been done by the counties during the fiscal year. The amount must be determined by the
number of performance credits a county accumulates during the year based on a performance credit
matrix jointly agreed upon by the commissioner in consultation with the Minnesota Association
of County Feedlot Officers executive team. To receive an award under this paragraph, the county
must meet the requirements of paragraph (c), clause (1), and achieve 90 percent of the requirements
according to paragraph (c), clause (2), of the formula. The rate of reimbursement per performance
credit item must not exceed $200.
    Subd. 3. Minimum grant; prorated grant; transfers. Delegated counties are eligible for a
minimum grant of $7,500. To receive the full $7,500 amount, a county must meet the requirements
under subdivision 2, paragraph (c). Nondelegated counties that apply for delegation shall receive
a grant prorated according to the number of full quarters remaining in the program year from the
date of commissioner approval of the delegation. Awards to any newly delegated counties must
be made out of the appropriation reserved under subdivision 2, paragraph (d). The commissioner,
in consultation with the Minnesota Association of County Feedlot Officers executive team, may
decide to use money reserved under subdivision 2, paragraph (d), in an amount not to exceed five
percent of the total annual appropriation for initiatives to enhance existing delegated county feedlot
programs, information and education, or technical assistance efforts to reduce feedlot-related
pollution hazards. Any amount remaining after distribution under subdivision 2, paragraphs (b)
and (c), must be transferred for purposes of subdivision 2, paragraph (d).
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116.41, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

shall conduct training programs for persons operating facilities for the disposal of waste and for
inspectors of such facilities, and m­­a­
                                       y shall charge such fees as are necessary to cover the actual
costs of the training programs. All fees received shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to
the Pollution Control Agency training account and are appropriated to the agency to pay expenses
relating to the training of disposal facility personnel.
    The agency shall require operators and inspectors of such facilities to obtain from the agency
a certificate of competence. The agency shall conduct examinations to test the competence of
applicants for certification, and shall require that certificates be renewed at reasonable intervals. The
agency may charge such fees as are necessary to cover the actual costs of receiving and processing
applications, conducting examinations, and issuing and renewing certificates. Certificates shall
not be required for a private individual for land-spreading and associated interim and temporary
storage of sewage sludge on property owned or farmed by that individual.

   Sec. 54. [216H.021] GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REPORTING.
   Subdivision 1. Commissioner to establish reporting system and maintain inventory. In
order to measure the progress in meeting the goals of section 216H.02, subdivision 1, and to
provide information to develop strategies to achieve those goals, the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency shall establish a system for reporting and maintaining an inventory of greenhouse
gas emissions. The commissioner must consult with the chief information officer of the Office
of Enterprise Technology about system design and operation. Greenhouse gas emissions include
those emissions described in section 216H.01, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 2. Reporting system design. (a) The commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, design
the system to coordinate with other regional or federal greenhouse gas emissions-reporting and
inventory systems. The coordination may, without limitation, include the use of similar forms and
reports, the sharing of information, and the use of common facilities, systems, and databases.
    (b) The reporting system need not include all sources of emissions nor all amounts of emissions
but, at its outset, must include:
   (1) all stationary sources and other facilities required to obtain a permit under Title V of the
federal Clean Air Act, United States Code, title 42, section 7401 et. seq.; and
    (2) facilities whose annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, as defined in section 216H.10,
subdivision 3, exceed a threshold set by the commissioner at between 10,000 tons and 25,000 tons.
The reporting threshold set by the commissioner must be consistent with the goal of accurately
tracking progress in attaining greenhouse gas emissions-reduction goals and the need for emissions
data to assist in developing greenhouse gas emissions-reduction strategies.
    (c) In designing the greenhouse gas emissions reporting system, the commissioner shall consider
requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels and greenhouse gas
emissions from natural gas combustion that are not included in reporting from stationary sources.
In determining whether to include reporting of these emissions, the commissioner must consider
both the goal of accurately tracking progress in attaining greenhouse gas emissions-reduction
goals and the need for emissions data to assist in developing greenhouse gas emissions-reduction
strategies recommended by the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group. If the commissioner
decides that transportation fuels and portions of natural gas combustion should not be included
in the initial emissions reporting system, the commissioner must report to the chairs and ranking
minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction

over energy and environmental policy the reasons for that decision and suggestions for steps that
should be taken to allow their inclusion in the emissions reporting system in the future.
    (d) A facility reporting greenhouse gas emissions under this section must maintain the data used
to create the reports for a minimum of five years.

of this subdivision, shall not exceed one-sixth of one percent of the total gross operating revenues
of the public utilities during the calendar year from retail sales of gas or electric service within the

      Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.62, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Assessing cooperatives and municipals. The commission and department may charge
cooperative electric associations, generation and transmission cooperative electric associations,
municipal power agencies, and municipal electric utilities their proportionate share of the expenses
incurred in the review and disposition of resource plans, adjudication of service area disputes,
proceedings under section 216B.1691, 216B.2425, or 216B.243, and the costs incurred in the
adjudication of complaints over service standards, practices, and rates. Cooperative electric
associations electing to become subject to rate regulation by the commission pursuant to section
216B.026, subdivision 4, are also subject to this section. Neither a cooperative electric association
nor a municipal electric utility is liable for costs and expenses in a calendar year in excess of the
limitation on costs that may be assessed against public utilities under subdivision 2. A cooperative
electric association, generation and transmission cooperative electric association, municipal
power agency, or municipal electric utility may object to and appeal bills of the commission and
department as provided in subdivision 4.

3968                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [46TH DAY

grade, unless the borrower is informed that the borrower may qualify for a higher investment grade
loan with a lower interest rate and/or lower discount points, and consents in writing to receipt of the
lower investment grade loan;
     For purposes of this section, "investment grade" refers to a system of categorizing residential
mortgage loans in which the loans are: (i) commonly referred to as "prime" or "subprime"; (ii)
commonly designated by an alphabetical character with "A" being the highest investment grade; and
(iii) are distinguished by interest rate or discount points or both charged to the borrower, which vary
according to the degree of perceived risk of default based on factors such as the borrower's credit,
including credit score and credit patterns, income and employment history, debt ratio, loan-to-value
ratio, and prior bankruptcy or foreclosure;
    (19) make, publish, disseminate, circulate, place before the public, or cause to be made,
directly or indirectly, any advertisement or marketing materials of any type, or any statement or
representation relating to the business of residential mortgage loans that is false, deceptive, or
misleading;
    (20) advertise loan types or terms that are not available from or through the licensee or exempt
person on the date advertised, or on the date specified in the advertisement. For purposes of this
clause, advertisement includes, but is not limited to, a list of sample mortgage terms, including
interest rates, discount points, and closing costs provided by licensees or exempt persons to a print
or electronic medium that presents the information to the public;
    (21) use or employ phrases, pictures, return addresses, geographic designations, or other means
that create the impression, directly or indirectly, that a licensee or other person is a governmental
agency, or is associated with, sponsored by, or in any manner connected to, related to, or endorsed
by a governmental agency, if that is not the case;
   (22) violate section 82.49, relating to table funding;
    (23) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan all or a portion of the proceeds
of which are used to fully or partially pay off a "special mortgage" unless the borrower has
obtained a written certification from an authorized independent loan counselor that the borrower
has received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction. For purposes of this section,
"special mortgage" means a residential mortgage loan originated, subsidized, or guaranteed by or
through a state, tribal, or local government, or nonprofit organization, that bears one or more of
the following nonstandard payment terms which substantially benefit the borrower: (i) payments
vary with income; (ii) payments of principal or interest are not required or can be deferred under
specified conditions; (iii) principal or interest is forgivable under specified conditions; or (iv)
where no interest or an annual interest rate of two percent or less is charged in connection with
the loan. For purposes of this section, "authorized independent loan counselor" means a nonprofit,
third-party individual or organization providing homebuyer education programs, foreclosure
prevention services, mortgage loan counseling, or credit counseling certified by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Minnesota Home Ownership Center, the
Minnesota Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Association, AARP, or NeighborWorks America;
    (24) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan without verifying the borrower's
reasonable ability to pay the scheduled payments of the following, as applicable: principal; interest;
real estate taxes; homeowner's insurance, assessments, and mortgage insurance premiums. For loans
in which the interest rate may vary, the reasonable ability to pay shall be determined based on a fully
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                          3969

indexed rate and a repayment schedule which achieves full amortization over the life of the loan.
For all residential mortgage loans, the borrower's income and financial resources must be verified
by tax returns, payroll receipts, bank records, or other similarly reliable documents.
    Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit a mortgage originator's or exempt person's
ability to rely on criteria other than the borrower's income and financial resources to establish the
borrower's reasonable ability to repay the residential mortgage loan, including criteria established
by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs or the United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development for interest rate reduction refinancing loans or streamline loans, or criteria
authorized or promulgated by the Federal National Mortgage Association or Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation; however, such other criteria must be verified through reasonably reliable
methods and documentation. The mortgage originator's analysis of the borrower's reasonable
ability to repay may include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following items, if verified:
(1) the borrower's current and expected income; (2) current and expected cash flow; (3) net worth
and other financial resources other than the consumer's equity in the dwelling that secures the
loan; (4) current financial obligations; (5) property taxes and insurance; (6) assessments on the
property; (7) employment status; (8) credit history; (9) debt-to-income ratio; (10) credit scores;
(11) tax returns; (12) pension statements; and (13) employment payment records, provided that no
mortgage originator shall disregard facts and circumstances that indicate that the financial or other
information submitted by the consumer is inaccurate or incomplete. A statement by the borrower
to the residential mortgage originator or exempt person of the borrower's income and resources
or sole reliance on any single item listed above is not sufficient to establish the existence of the
income or resources when verifying the reasonable ability to pay.
    (25) engage in "churning." As used in this section, "churning" means knowingly or intentionally
making, providing, or arranging for a residential mortgage loan when the new residential mortgage
loan does not provide a reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the
circumstances including the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan,
and the borrower's circumstances;
    (26) the first time a residential mortgage originator orally informs a borrower of the anticipated or
actual periodic payment amount for a first-lien residential mortgage loan which does not include an
amount for payment of property taxes and hazard insurance, the residential mortgage originator must
inform the borrower that an additional amount will be due for taxes and insurance and, if known,
disclose to the borrower the amount of the anticipated or actual periodic payments for property taxes
and hazard insurance. This same oral disclosure must be made each time the residential mortgage
originator orally informs the borrower of a different anticipated or actual periodic payment amount
change from the amount previously disclosed. A residential mortgage originator need not make
this disclosure concerning a refinancing loan if the residential mortgage originator knows that the
borrower's existing loan that is anticipated to be refinanced does not have an escrow account; or
    (27) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan, other than a reverse mortgage
pursuant to United States Code, title 15, chapter 41, if the borrower's compliance with any repayment
option offered pursuant to the terms of the loan will result in negative amortization during any
six-month period.
    (b) Paragraph (a), clauses (24) through (27), do not apply to a state or federally chartered bank,
savings bank, or credit union, an institution chartered by Congress under the Farm Credit Act, or
to a person making, providing, or arranging a residential mortgage loan originated or purchased by

    Sec. 11. [60A.1291] ANNUAL AUDIT.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this subdivision apply to this section.
    (a) "Accountant" and "independent public accountant" mean an independent certified public
accountant or accounting firm in good standing with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and in all states in which the accountant or firm is licensed or is required to be

or British-chartered accountant.
    (b) "Audit committee" means a committee or equivalent body established by the board of
directors of an entity for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes
of an insurer or group of insurers, and audits of financial statements of the insurer or group of
insurers. The audit committee of any entity that controls a group of insurers may be deemed to
be the audit committee for one or more of these controlled insurers solely for the purposes of this
section at the election of the controlling person under subdivision 15, paragraph (e). If an audit
committee is not designated by the insurer, the insurer's entire board of directors constitutes the
audit committee.
    (c) "Indemnification" means an agreement of indemnity or a release from liability where the
intent or effect is to shift or limit in any manner the potential liability of the person or firm for
failure to adhere to applicable auditing or professional standards, whether or not resulting in part
from knowing of other misrepresentations made by the insurer or its representatives.
   (d) "Independent board member" has the same meaning as described in subdivision 15,
paragraph (c).
    (e) "Internal control over financial reporting" means a process effected by an entity's board of
directors, management, and other personnel designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the financial statements, for example, those items specified in subdivision 4, paragraphs
(a), clauses (2) to (6), (b), and (c), and includes those policies and procedures that:
    (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of assets;
   (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements, for example, those items specified in subdivision 4,
paragraphs (a), clauses (2) to (6), (b), and (c), and that receipts and expenditures are being made
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                          3971

only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and
    (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements,
for example, those items specified in subdivision 4, paragraphs (a), clauses (2) to (6), (b), and (c).
   (f) "SEC" means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
   (g) "Section 404" means Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC's rules
and regulations promulgated under it.
   (h) "Section 404 report" means management's report on "internal control over financial
reporting" as defined by the SEC and the related attestation report of the independent certified
public accountant as described in paragraph (a).
     (i) "SOX compliant entity" means an entity that either is required to be compliant with, or
voluntarily is compliant with, all of the following provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:
(i) the preapproval requirements of Section 201 (section 10A(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934); (ii) the audit committee independence requirements of Section 301 (section 10A(m)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and (iii) the internal control over financial reporting requirements
of Section 404 (Item 308 of SEC Regulation S-K).
    Subd. 2. Filing requirements. Every insurance company doing business in this state, including
fraternal benefit societies, reciprocal exchanges, service plan corporations licensed pursuant to
chapter 62C, and legal service plans licensed pursuant to chapter 62G, unless exempted by the
commissioner pursuant to subdivision 9, paragraph (a), or by subdivision 18, shall have an annual
audit of the financial activities of the most recently completed calendar year performed by an
independent certified public accountant, and shall file the report of this audit with the commissioner
on or before June 1 for the immediately preceding year ending December 31. The commissioner
may require an insurer to file an audited financial report earlier than June 1 with 90 days' advance
notice to the insurer.
   Extensions of the June 1 filing date may be granted by the commissioner for 30-day periods
upon a showing by the insurer and its independent certified public accountant of the reasons for
requesting the extension and a determination by the commissioner of good cause for the extension.
    The request for extension must be submitted in writing not less than ten days before the due
date in sufficient detail to permit the commissioner to make an informed decision with respect to
the requested extension.
   If an extension is granted in accordance with this subdivision, a similar extension of 30 days is
granted to the filing of management's report of internal control over financial reporting.
    Every insurer required to file an annual audited financial report pursuant to this subdivision shall
designate a group of individuals as constituting its audit committee. The audit committee of an
entity that controls an insurer may be deemed to be the insurer's audit committee for purposes of
this subdivision at the election of the controlling person.
   Subd. 3. Exemptions. Foreign and alien insurers filing audited financial reports in another state
under the other state's requirements of audited financial reports which have been found by the
commissioner to be substantially similar to these requirements are exempt from this section if a
3972                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

copy of the audited financial report, communication of internal control related matters noted in an
audit, accountant's letter of qualifications, and report on significant deficiencies in internal controls,
which are filed with the other state, are filed with the commissioner in accordance with the filing
dates specified in subdivision 2 (Canadian insurers may submit accountants' reports as filed with the
Canadian Dominion Department of Insurance); and a copy of any notification of adverse financial
condition report filed with the other state is filed with the commissioner within the time specified in
subdivision 11. Foreign or alien insurers required to file management's report of internal control over
financial reporting in another state are exempt from filing the report in this state provided the other
state has substantially similar reporting requirements and the report is filed with the commissioner
of the other state within the time specified. This subdivision does not prohibit or in any way limit
the commissioner from ordering, conducting, and performing examinations of insurers under the
authority of this chapter.
   Subd. 4. Contents of annual audit; financial report. (a) The annual audited financial report
must report, in conformity with statutory accounting practices required or permitted by the
commissioner of insurance of the state of domicile, the financial position of the insurer as of the
end of the most recent calendar year and the results of its operations, cash flows, and changes in
capital and surplus for the year ended. The annual audited financial report must include:
   (1) a report of an independent certified public accountant;
   (2) a balance sheet reporting admitted assets, liabilities, capital, and surplus;
   (3) a statement of operations;
   (4) a statement of cash flows;
   (5) a statement of changes in capital and surplus; and
   (6) notes to the financial statements.
    (b) The notes required under paragraph (a) are those required by the appropriate National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) annual statement instructions and National
Association of Insurance Commissioners Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and include
reconciliation of differences, if any, between the audited statutory financial statements and the
annual statement filed under section 60A.13, subdivision 1, with a written description of the nature
of these differences.
    (c) The financial statements included in the audited financial report must be prepared in a form
and using language and groupings substantially the same as the relevant sections of the annual
statement of the insurer filed with the commissioner. The financial statement must be comparative,
presenting the amounts as of December 31 of the current year and the amounts as of the immediately
preceding December 31. In the first year in which an insurer is required to file an audited financial
report, the comparative data may be omitted. The amounts may be rounded to the nearest $1,000,
and all immaterial amounts may be combined.
    Subd. 5. Designation of independent certified public accountant. Each insurer required by this
section to file an annual audited financial report must notify the commissioner in writing of the name
and address of the independent certified public accountant or accounting firm retained to conduct
the annual audit within 60 days after becoming subject to the annual audit requirement. The insurer
shall obtain from the accountant a letter which states that the accountant is aware of the provisions
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                           3973

that relate to accounting and financial matters in the insurance laws and the rules of the insurance
regulatory authority of the state of domicile. The letter shall affirm that the accountant will express an
opinion on the financial statements in terms of their conformity to the statutory accounting practices
prescribed or otherwise permitted by that insurance regulatory authority, specifying the exceptions
believed to be appropriate. A copy of the accountant's letter shall be filed with the commissioner.
    Subd. 6. Report of disagreements. If an accountant who was the accountant for the
immediately preceding filed audited financial report is dismissed or resigns, the insurer shall
notify the commissioner of this event within five business days. Within ten business days of this
notification, the insurer shall also furnish the commissioner with a separate letter stating whether
in the 24 months preceding this event there were any disagreements with the former accountant
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of the former accountant, would have
caused that person to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with
the opinion on the financial statements. The disagreements required to be reported in response to
this subdivision include both those resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction and those not
resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction. Disagreements contemplated by this subdivision
are those disagreements between personnel of the insurer responsible for presentation of its
financial statements and personnel of the accounting firm responsible for rendering its report.
The insurer shall also in writing request the former accountant to furnish a letter addressed to the
insurer stating whether the accountant agrees with the statements contained in the insurer's letter
and, if not, stating the reasons for any disagreement. The insurer shall furnish this responsive letter
from the former accountant to the commissioner together with its own.
    Subd. 7. Qualifications of independent certified public accountant. (a) The commissioner
shall not recognize any person or firm as a qualified independent certified public accountant that is
not in good standing with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and in all states
in which the accountant is licensed or is required to be licensed to practice, or for a Canadian
or British company, that is not a chartered accountant, or that has either directly or indirectly
entered into an agreement of indemnity or release from liability (collectively referred to as an
indemnification agreement) with respect to the audit of the insurer. Except as otherwise provided,
an independent certified public accountant must be recognized as qualified as long as the person
conforms to the standards of the person's profession, as contained in the Code of Professional
Conduct of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Code of Professional
Conduct of the Minnesota Board of Public Accountancy or similar code and the person is properly
licensed in good standing with all required state boards of accountancy.
    (b) The lead or coordinating audit partner, having primary responsibility for the audit, may not
act in that capacity for more than five consecutive years. The person shall be disqualified from acting
in that or a similar capacity for the same company or its insurance subsidiaries or affiliates for a
period of five consecutive years. An insurer may make application to the commissioner for relief
from this rotation requirement on the basis of unusual circumstances. This application must be made
at least 30 days before the end of the calendar year. The commissioner may consider the following
factors in determining if the relief should be granted:
    (1) number of partners, expertise of the partners, or the number of insurance clients in the
currently registered firm;
   (2) premium volume of the insurer; or
3974                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [46TH DAY

   (3) number of jurisdictions in which the insurer transacts business.
The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval for relief from this paragraph
with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and with the NAIC. If the nondomestic state
accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format
acceptable to the NAIC.
   (c) The commissioner shall not recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant,
nor accept an annual audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by an accountant who
provides to an insurer, contemporaneously with the audit, the following nonaudit services:
    (1) bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the
insurer;
   (2) financial information systems design and implementation;
   (3) appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution in-kind reports;
    (4) actuarially oriented advisory services involving the determination of amounts recorded
in the financial statements. The accountant may assist an insurer in understanding the methods,
assumptions, and inputs used in the determination of amounts recorded in the financial statement
only if it is reasonable to conclude that the services provided will not be subject to audit procedures
during an audit of the insurer's financial statements. An accountant's actuary may also issue an
actuarial opinion or certification on an insurer's reserves if the following conditions have been met:
   (i) neither the accountant nor the accountant's actuary has performed any management functions
or made any management decisions;
    (ii) the insurer has competent personnel, or engages a third-party actuary, to estimate the loss
reserves for which management takes responsibility; and
  (iii) the accountant's actuary tests the reasonableness of the reserves after the insurer's
management has determined the amount of the loss reserves;
   (5) internal audit outsourcing services;
   (6) management functions or human resources;
   (7) broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services;
   (8) legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit; and
   (9) any other services that the commissioner determines, by rule, are impermissible.
    (d) The commissioner shall not recognize as a qualified independent certified public accountant,
nor accept any audited financial report, prepared in whole or in part by any natural person who has
been convicted of fraud, bribery, a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act, United States Code, title 18, sections 1961 to 1968, or any dishonest conduct or practices under
federal or state law, has been found to have violated the insurance laws of this state with respect
to any previous reports submitted under this section, or has demonstrated a pattern or practice of
failing to detect or disclose material information in previous reports filed under the provisions of
this section.
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                          3975

    (e) The commissioner, after notice and hearing under chapter 14, may find that the accountant is
not qualified for purposes of expressing an opinion on the financial statements in the annual audited
financial report. The commissioner may require the insurer to replace the accountant with another
whose relationship with the insurer is qualified within the meaning of this section.
    Subd. 8. Exemptions to qualifications of certified public accountant. (a) Insurers having
direct written and assumed premiums of less than $100,000,000 in any calendar year may request
an exemption from subdivision 7, paragraph (c). The insurer shall file with the commissioner a
written statement discussing the reasons why the insurer should be exempt from these provisions.
If the commissioner finds, upon review of this statement, that compliance with this section would
constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon the insurer, an exemption may be granted.
     (b) A qualified independent certified public accountant who performs the audit may engage in
other nonaudit services, including tax services, that are not described in subdivision 7, paragraph
(c), only if the activity is approved in advance by the audit committee, in accordance with paragraph
(c).
   (c) All auditing services and nonaudit services provided to an insurer by the qualified
independent certified public accountant of the insurer must be preapproved by the audit committee.
The preapproval requirement is waived with respect to nonaudit services if the insurer is a SOX
compliant entity or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a SOX compliant entity or:
    (1) the aggregate amount of all such nonaudit services provided to the insurer constitutes not
more than five percent of the total amount of fees paid by the insurer to its qualified independent
certified public accountant during the fiscal year in which the nonaudit services are provided;
    (2) the services were not recognized by the insurer at the time of the engagement to be nonaudit
services; and
    (3) the services are promptly brought to the attention of the audit committee and approved before
the completion of the audit by the audit committee or by one or more members of the audit committee
who are the members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been
delegated by the audit committee.
    (d) The audit committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the audit committee
the authority to grant the preapprovals required by paragraph (c). The decisions of any member
to whom this authority is delegated must be presented to the full audit committee at each of its
scheduled meetings.
    (e) The commissioner shall not recognize an independent certified public accountant as qualified
for a particular insurer if a member of the board, president, chief executive officer, controller, chief
financial officer, chief accounting officer, or any person serving in an equivalent position for that
insurer, was employed by the independent certified public accountant and participated in the audit
of that insurer during the one-year period preceding the date that the most current statutory opinion
is due. This paragraph applies only to partners and senior managers involved in the audit. An insurer
may make application to the commissioner for relief from this paragraph on the basis of unusual
circumstances.
    (f) The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval for relief with the states
that it is licensed in or doing business in and the NAIC. If the nondomestic state accepts electronic
3976                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic format acceptable to the
NAIC.
    Subd. 9. Consolidated or combined audits. (a) The commissioner may allow an insurer to file
consolidated or combined audited financial statements required by subdivision 2, in lieu of separate
annual audited financial statements, where it can be demonstrated that an insurer is part of a group
of insurance companies that has a pooling or 100 percent reinsurance agreement which substantially
affects the solvency and integrity of the reserves of the insurer and the insurer cedes all of its direct
and assumed business to the pool. An affiliated insurance company not meeting these requirements
may be included in the consolidated or combined audited financial statements, if the company's
total admitted assets are less than five percent of the consolidated group's total admitted assets. If
these circumstances exist, then the company may file a written application to file consolidated or
combined audited financial statements. This application must be for a specified period.
    (b) Upon written application by a domestic insurer, the commissioner may authorize the
domestic insurer to include additional affiliated insurance companies in the consolidated or
combined audited financial statements. A foreign insurer must obtain the prior written authorization
of the commissioner of its state of domicile in order to submit an application for authority to file
consolidated or combined audited financial statements. This application must be for a specified
period.
    (c) A consolidated annual audit filing must include a columnar consolidated or combining
worksheet. Amounts shown on the audited consolidated or combined financial statement must
be shown on the worksheet. Amounts for each insurer must be stated separately. Noninsurance
operations may be shown on the worksheet on a combined or individual basis. Explanations of
consolidating or eliminating entries must be shown on the worksheet. A reconciliation of any
differences between the amounts shown in the individual insurer columns of the worksheet and
comparable amounts shown on the annual statement of the insurers must be included on the
worksheet.
    Subd. 10. Scope of audit and report of independent certified public accountant. Financial
statements furnished pursuant to subdivision 4 must be examined by an independent certified
public accountant. The audit of the insurer's financial statements must be conducted in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards. In accordance with AICPA Statement on Auditing
Standards (SAS) No. 109, Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks
of Material Misstatement, or its replacement, the independent certified public accountant should
obtain an understanding of internal control sufficient to plan the audit. To the extent required
by SAS No. 109, for those insurers required to file a management's report of internal control
over financial reporting pursuant to subdivision 17, the independent certified public accountant
should consider (as that term is defined in SAS No. 102, Defining Professional Requirements in
Statements on Auditing Standards or its replacement) the most recently available report in planning
and performing the audit of the statutory financial statements. Consideration should be given to
other procedures illustrated in the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook promulgated by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners as the independent certified public accountant
deems necessary.
   Subd. 11. Notification of adverse financial condition. The insurer required to furnish the
annual audited financial report shall require the independent certified public accountant to provide
written notice within five business days to the board of directors of the insurer or its audit
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                           3977

committee of any determination by that independent certified public accountant that the insurer
has materially misstated its financial condition as reported to the commissioner as of the balance
sheet date currently under audit or that the insurer does not meet the minimum capital and surplus
requirement of sections 60A.07, 66A.32, and 66A.33 as of that date. An insurer required to file an
annual audited financial report who received a notification of adverse financial condition from the
accountant shall file a copy of the notification with the commissioner within five business days of
the receipt of the notification. The insurer shall provide the independent certified public accountant
making the notification with evidence of the report being furnished to the commissioner. If the
independent certified public accountant fails to receive the evidence within the required five-day
period, the independent certified public accountant shall furnish to the commissioner a copy of the
notification to the board of directors or its audit committee within the next five business days. No
independent certified public accountant is liable in any manner to any person for any statement
made in connection with this subdivision if the statement is made in good faith in compliance with
this subdivision. If the accountant becomes aware of facts which might have affected the audited
financial report after the date it was filed, the accountant shall take the action prescribed by AU
section 561, Subsequent Discovery of Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor's Report of the
Professional Standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or its
replacement.
    Subd. 12. Communication of internal control related matters noted in an audit. In addition
to the annual audited financial report, each insurer shall furnish the commissioner with a written
communication as to any unremediated material weaknesses in its internal control over financial
reporting noted during the audit. The communication must be prepared by the accountant within
60 days after the filing of the annual audited financial report, and must contain a description of
any unremediated material weakness, as the term material weakness is defined by SAS No. 115,
Communicating Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit, or its replacement, as of
December 31 immediately preceding so as to coincide with the audited financial report discussed in
subdivision 2 in the insurer's internal control over financial reporting noted by the accountant during
the course of their audit of the financial statements. If no unremediated material weaknesses were
noted, the communication should so state.
    The insurer is required to provide a description of remedial actions taken or proposed to
correct unremediated material weaknesses, if the actions are not described in the accountant's
communication.
    Subd. 13. Accountant's letter of qualification. The accountant shall furnish the insurer in
connection with, and for inclusion in, the filing of the annual audited financial report, a letter stating
that the accountant is independent with respect to the insurer and conforms to the standards of the
accountant's profession as contained in the Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants and the Code of Professional Conduct of the Minnesota Board
of Accountancy or similar code; the background and experience in general, and the experience
in audits of insurers of the staff assigned to the engagement and whether each is an independent
certified public accountant; that the accountant understands that the annual audited financial report
and the opinion on it will be filed in compliance with this statute and that the commissioner will be
relying on this information in the monitoring and regulation of the financial position of insurers;
that the accountant consents to the requirements of subdivision 14 and that the accountant consents
and agrees to make available for review by the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee or
appointed agent, the work papers, as defined in subdivision 14; a representation that the accountant
3978                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

is properly licensed in good standing by the appropriate state licensing authorities and is a member
in good standing in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; and a representation
that the accountant complies with subdivision 7. Nothing in this section prohibits the accountant
from utilizing staff the accountant deems appropriate where use is consistent with the standards
prescribed by generally accepted auditing standards.
    Subd. 14. Availability and maintenance of independent certified public accountants' work
papers. Work papers are the records kept by the independent certified public accountant of the
procedures followed, tests performed, information obtained, and conclusions reached pertinent
to the independent certified public accountant's audit of the financial statements of an insurer.
Work papers may include audit planning documents, work programs, analyses, memoranda, letters
of confirmation and representation, management letters, abstracts of company documents, and
schedules or commentaries prepared or obtained by the independent certified public accountant in
the course of the audit of the financial statements of an insurer and that support the accountant's
opinion. Every insurer required to file an audited financial report shall require the accountant,
through the insurer, to make available for review by the examiners the work papers prepared in the
conduct of the audit and any communications related to the audit between the accountant and the
insurer. The work papers must be made available at the offices of the insurer, at the offices of the
commissioner, or at any other reasonable place designated by the commissioner. The insurer shall
require that the accountant retain the audit work papers and communications until the commissioner
has filed a report on examination covering the period of the audit but no longer than seven years
after the period reported upon, provided retention of the working papers beyond the seven years
is not required by other professional or regulatory requirements. In the conduct of the periodic
review by the examiners, it must be agreed that photocopies of pertinent audit work papers may
be made and retained by the commissioner. These copies shall be part of the commissioner's work
papers and must be given the same confidentiality as other examination work papers generated by
the commissioner.
    Subd. 15. Requirements for audit committee. (a) The audit committee must be directly
responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any accountant
including resolution of disagreements between management and the accountant regarding financial
reporting for the purpose of preparing or issuing the audited financial report or related work
pursuant to this section. Each accountant shall report directly to the audit committee.
    (b) Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of directors of the
insurer or a member of the board of directors of an entity elected pursuant to paragraph (e) and
subdivision 1, paragraph (b).
    (c) In order to be considered independent for purposes of this section, a member of the audit
committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board
of directors, or any other board committee, accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory
fee from the entity or be an affiliated person of the entity or any subsidiary of the entity. However, if
law requires board participation by otherwise nonindependent members, that law shall prevail and
such members may participate in the audit committee and be designated as independent for audit
committee purposes, unless they are an officer or employee of the insurer or one of its affiliates.
    (d) If a member of the audit committee ceases to be independent for reasons outside the member's
reasonable control, that person, with notice by the responsible entity to the state, may remain an
audit committee member of the responsible entity until the earlier of the next annual meeting of the
46TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                           3979

responsible entity or one year from the occurrence of the event that caused the member to be no
longer independent.
    (e) To exercise the election of the controlling person to designate the audit committee for
purposes of this section, the ultimate controlling person shall provide written notice to the
commissioners of the affected insurers. Notification must be made timely before the issuance of
the statutory audit report and include a description of the basis for the election. The election can be
changed through notice to the commissioner by the insurer, which shall include a description of the
basis for the change. The election remains in effect for perpetuity, until rescinded.
    (f) The audit committee shall require the accountant that performs for an insurer any audit
required by this section to timely report to the audit committee in accordance with the requirements
of SAS No. 114, The Auditor's Communication with Those Charged with Governance, or its
replacement, including:
   (1) all significant accounting policies and material permitted practices;
    (2) all material alternative treatments of financial information within statutory accounting
principles that have been discussed with management officials of the insurer, ramifications of the
use of the alternative disclosures and treatments, and the treatment preferred by the accountant; and
    (3) other material written communications between the accountant and the management of the
insurer, such as any management letter or schedule of unadjusted differences.
    (g) If an insurer is a member of an insurance holding company system, the reports required
by paragraph (f) may be provided to the audit committee on an aggregate basis for insurers in the
holding company system, provided that any substantial differences among insurers in the system
are identified to the audit committee.
    (h) The proportion of independent audit committee members shall meet or exceed the following
criteria:
   (1) for companies with prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums $0 to
$300,000,000, no minimum requirements;
   (2) for companies with prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums over
$300,000,000 to $500,000,000, majority of members must be independent; and
   (3) for companies with prior calendar year direct written and assumed premiums over
$500,000,000, 75 percent or more must be independent.
    (i) An insurer with direct written and assumed premium, excluding premiums reinsured with
the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and Federal Flood Program, less than $500,000,000 may
make application to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this subdivision based
upon hardship. The insurer shall file, with its annual statement filing, the approval for relief from this
subdivision with the states that it is licensed in or doing business in and the NAIC. If the nondomestic
state accepts electronic filing with the NAIC, the insurer shall file the approval in an electronic
format acceptable to the NAIC.
    This subdivision does not apply to foreign or alien insurers licensed in this state or an insurer
that is a SOX compliant entity or a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a SOX compliant
3980                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

entity.
   Subd. 16. Conduct of insurer in connection with the preparation of required reports and
documents. (a) No director or officer of an insurer shall, directly or indirectly:
   (1) make or cause to be made a materially false or misleading statement to an accountant in
connection with any audit, review, or communication required under this section; or
    (2) omit to state, or cause another person to omit to state, any material fact necessary in order
to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which the statements were made, not
misleading to an accountant in connection with any audit, review, or communication required under
this section.
    (b) No officer or director of an insurer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof,
shall directly or indirectly take any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or fraudulently influence
any accountant engaged in the performance of an audit pursuant to this section if that person knew
or should have known that the action, if successful, could result in rendering the insurer's financial
statements materially misleading.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (b), actions that, "if successful, could result in rendering the
insurer's financial statements materially misleading" include, but are not limited to, actions taken
at any time with respect to the professional engagement period to coerce, manipulate, mislead, or
fraudulently influence an accountant:
    (1) to issue or reissue a report on an insurer's financial statements that is not warranted in
the circumstances due to material violations of statutory accounting principles prescribed by the
commissioner, generally accepted auditing standards, or other professional or regulatory standards;
    (2) not to perform audit, review, or other procedures required by generally accepted auditing
standards or other professional standards;
    (3) not to withdraw an issued report; or
    (4) not to communicate matters to an insurer's audit committee.
    Subd. 17. Management's report of internal control over financial reporting. (a) Every insurer
required to file an audited financial report pursuant to this section that has annual direct written and
assumed premiums, excluding premiums reinsured with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and
Federal Flood Program, of $500,000,000 or more, shall prepare a report of the insurer's or group of
insurers' internal control over financial reporting, as these terms are defined in subdivision 1. The
report must be filed with the commissioner along with the communication of internal control related
matters noted in an audit described under subdivision 12. Management's report of internal control
over financial reporting shall be as of December 31 immediately preceding.
    (b) Notwithstanding the premium threshold in paragraph (a), the commissioner may require an
insurer to file management's report of internal control over financial reporting if the insurer is in any
RBC level event, or meets any one or more of the standards of an insurer deemed to be in hazardous
financial condition pursuant to sections 60G.20 to 60G.22.
    (c) An insurer or a group of insurers that is:
    (1) directly subject to Section 404;
46TH DAY]                              MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                            3981

   (2) part of a holding company system whose parent is directly subject to Section 404;
   (3) not directly subject to Section 404 but is a SOX compliant entity; or
    (4) a member of a holding company system whose parent is not directly subject to Section 404
but is a SOX compliant entity;
may file its or its parent's Section 404 report and an addendum in satisfaction of this requirement
provided that those internal controls of the insurer or group of insurers having a material impact on
the preparation of the insurer's or group of insurers' audited statutory financial statements, consisting
of those items included in subdivision 4, paragraphs (a), clauses (2) to (6), (b), and (c), were included
in the scope of the Section 404 report. The addendum shall be a positive statement by management
that there are no material processes with respect to the preparation of the insurer's or group of
insurers' audited statutory financial statements, consisting of those items included in subdivision
4, paragraphs (a), clauses (2) to (6), (b), and (c), excluded from the Section 404 report. If there are
internal controls of the insurer or group of insurers that have a material impact on the preparation of
the insurer's or group of insurers' audited statutory financial statements and those internal controls
were not included in the scope of the Section 404 report, the insurer or group of insurers may either
file (i) a report under this subdivision, or (ii) the Section 404 report and a report under this subdivision
for those internal controls that have a material impact on the preparation of the insurer's or group of
insurers' audited statutory financial statements not covered by the Section 404 report.
   (d) Management's report of internal control over financial reporting shall include:
    (1) a statement that management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting;
    (2) a statement that management has established internal control over financial reporting and an
assertion, to the best of management's knowledge and belief, after diligent inquiry, as to whether its
internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles;
    (3) a statement that briefly describes the approach or processes by which management evaluated
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;
   (4) a statement that briefly describes the scope of work that is included and whether any internal
controls were excluded;
    (5) disclosure of any unremediated material weaknesses in the internal control over financial
reporting identified by management as of December 31 immediately preceding. Management is
not permitted to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements in accordance with statutory
accounting principles if there is one or more unremediated material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting;
   (6) a statement regarding the inherent limitations of internal control systems; and
    (7) signatures of the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer or equivalent position
or title.

3982                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [46TH DAY

basis upon which its assertions, required in paragraph (d), are made. Management may base its
assertions, in part, upon its review, monitoring, and testing of internal controls undertaken in the
normal course of its activities.
    (1) Management has discretion as to the nature of the internal control framework used, and the
nature and extent of documentation, in order to make its assertion in a cost-effective manner and,
as such, may include assembly of or reference to existing documentation.
   (2) Management's report on internal control over financial reporting, required by paragraph (a),
and any documentation provided in support of the report during the course of a financial condition
examination, must be kept confidential by the Department of Commerce.
    Subd. 18. Exemptions. (a) Upon written application of any insurer, the commissioner may
grant an exemption from compliance with the provisions of this section. In order to receive an
exemption, an insurer must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that compliance
would constitute a financial or organizational hardship upon the insurer. An exemption may be
granted at any time and from time to time for specified periods. Within ten days from the denial
of an insurer's written request for an exemption, the insurer may request in writing a hearing on
its application for an exemption. This hearing must be held in accordance with chapter 14. Upon
written application of any insurer, the commissioner may permit an insurer to file annual audited
financial reports on some basis other than a calendar year basis for a specified period. An exemption
may not be granted until the insurer presents an alternative method satisfying the purposes of this
section. Within ten days from a denial of a written request for an exemption, the insurer may request
in writing a hearing on its application. The hearing must be held in accordance with chapter 14.
    (b) This section applies to all insurers, unless otherwise indicated, required to file an annual audit
by subdivision 2, except insurers having less than $1,000,000 of direct written premiums in this state
in any calendar year and fewer than 1,000 policyholders or certificate holders of directly written
policies nationwide at the end of the calendar year, are exempt from this section for that year, unless
the commissioner makes a specific finding that compliance is necessary for the commissioner to
carry out statutory responsibilities, except that insurers having assumed premiums from reinsurance
contracts or treaties of $1,000,000 or more are not exempt.
    Subd. 19. Canadian and British companies. (a) In the case of Canadian and British insurers,
the annual audited financial report means the annual statement of total business on the form filed by
these companies with their domiciliary supervision authority and duly audited by an independent
chartered accountant.
    (b) For these insurers the letter required in subdivision 5 shall state that the accountant is aware
of the requirements relating to the annual audited statement filed with the commissioner under
subdivision 2, and shall affirm that the opinion expressed is in conformity with those requirements.
    Subd. 20. Commercial mortgage loan valuation procedures. A report of the independent
certified public accountant that performs the audit of an insurer's annual statement as required under
subdivision 2, shall be filed and contain a statement as to whether anything in connection with the
audit came to the accountant's attention that caused the accountant to believe that the insurer failed to
adopt and consistently apply the valuation procedures as required by sections 60A.122 and 60A.123.
    Subd. 21. Examinations. (a) The commissioner or a designated representative shall determine
the nature, scope, and frequency of examinations under this section conducted by examiners under
46TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 4, 2009                                        3983

section 60A.031. These examinations may cover all aspects of the insurer's assets, condition,
affairs, and operations and may include and be supplemented by audit procedures performed
by independent certified public accountants. Scheduling of examinations will take into account
all relevant matters with respect to the insurer's condition, including results of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, Insurance Regulatory Information Systems, changes
in management, results of market conduct examinations, and audited financial reports. The type
of examinations performed by examiners under this section must be compliance examinations,
targeted examinations, and comprehensive examinations.
    (b) Compliance examinations will consist of a review of the accountant's workpapers defined
under this section and a general review of the insurer's corporate affairs and insurance operations
to determine compliance with the Minnesota insurance laws and the rules of the Department
of Commerce. The examiners may perform alternative or additional examination procedures to
supplement those performed by the accountant when the examiners determine that the procedures
are necessary to verify the financial condition of the insurer.
   (c) Targeted examinations may cover limited areas of the insurer's operations as the
commissioner may deem appropriate.
    (d) Comprehensive examinations will be performed when the report of the accountant as
provided for in subdivision 7, paragraph (b), the notification required by subdivision 7, paragraph
(c), the results of compliance or targeted examinations, or other circumstances indicate in the
judgment of the commissioner or a designated representative that a complete examination of the
condition and affairs of the insurer is necessary.
   (e) Upon completion of each targeted, compliance, or comprehensive examination, the
examiner appointed by the commissioner shall make a full and true report on the results of the
examination. Each report shall include a general description of the audit procedures performed
by the examiners and the procedures of the accountant that the examiners may have utilized to
supplement their examination procedures and the procedures that were performed by the registered
independent certified public accountant if included as a supplement to the examination.
    Subd. 22. Penalties. An annual statement, report, or document related to the business of
insurance must not be filed with the commissioner or issued to the public if it is signed by anyone
who is represented in the instrument as an "accountant," unless the person is qualified as defined
by this section. A violation of this subdivision is a violation of section 72A.19 and punishable in
accordance with section 72A.25.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) Domestic insurers retaining a certified public accountant on the
effective date of this section who qualify as independent shall comply with this section for the year
ending December 31, 2010, and each year thereafter unless the commissioner permits otherwise.
    (b) Domestic insurers not retaining a certified public accountant on the effective date of this

    (e) The requirements of subdivision 15 are in effect January 1, 2010. An insurer or group of
insurers that is not required to have independent audit committee members or only a majority of
independent audit committee members, as opposed to a supermajority, because the total written
and assumed premium is below the threshold and subsequently becomes subject to one of the
independence requirements due to changes in premium has one year following the year the
threshold is exceeded, but not earlier than January 1, 2010, to comply with the independence
requirements. Likewise, an insurer that becomes subject to one of the independence requirements
as a result of a business combination has one calendar year following the date of acquisition or
combination to comply with the independence requirements.
     (f) An insurer or group of insurers that is not required to file a report because the total written
premium is below the threshold and subsequently becomes subject to the reporting requirements

to file a report. Likewise, an insurer acquired in a business combination has two calendar years
following the date of acquisition or combination to comply with the reporting requirements.
    (g) The requirements and provisions contained in this section are effective January 1, 2010, and
thereafter.

or that its assets do not exceed its liabilities plus the greater of (1) any capital and surplus required
by law to be constantly maintained, or (2) its authorized and issued capital stock. For purposes
of this subdivision, "assets" includes one-half of the maximum total assessment liability of the
policyholders of the insurer, and "liabilities" includes reserves required by law. For policies issued on
the basis of unlimited assessment liability, the maximum total liability, for purposes of determining
solvency only, shall be deemed to be that amount that could be obtained if there were 100 percent
collection of an assessment at the rate of ten mills per dollar of insurance written by it and in force.

categories for the time period during which sections 60L.01 to 60L.15 apply to the insurer. For
purposes of this subdivision, the rating must be based on a review of the insurer by the nationally
recognized statistical rating organization with the cooperation of the insurer; must not depend on a
guarantee or other credit enhancement from another entity; and must not be modified or otherwise
qualified to show dependence of the rating on the performance or a contractual obligation of, or the
insurer's affiliation with, another insurer.
    (c) The insurer or an affiliate, as defined in section 60D.15, subdivision 2, of the insurer shall
employ at least one individual as a professional investment manager for the insurer's investments
whom the board of directors or trustees of the insurer finds is qualified on the basis of experience,
education or training, competence, personal integrity, and who conducts professional investment
management activities in accordance with the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct
of the Association for Investment Management and Research. For purposes of complying with this
paragraph, an employee of an affiliate may only be used if they are responsible for managing the
insurer's investments.
    (d) The board of directors of the insurer must annually adopt a resolution finding that the insurer
or an affiliate, as defined in section 60D.15, subdivision 2, of the insurer has employed a professional
investment manager for the insurer's investments with sufficient expertise and has sufficient other

    (1) "2001 CSO Mortality Table (2001 CSO)" means that mortality table, consisting of separate
rates of mortality for male and female lives, developed by the American Academy of Actuaries
CSO Task Force from the Valuation Basic Mortality Table developed by the Society of Actuaries
Individual Life Insurance Valuation Mortality Task Force, and adopted by the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in December 2002. The 2001 CSO Mortality Table (2001
CSO) is included in the Proceedings of the NAIC (2nd Quarter 2002). Unless the context indicates
otherwise, the "2001 CSO Mortality Table (2001 CSO)" includes both the ultimate form of that
table and the select and ultimate form of that table and includes both the smoker and nonsmoker
mortality tables and the composite mortality tables. It also includes both the age-nearest-birthday
and age-last-birthday bases of the mortality tables;
   (2) "Ultimate 1980 CSO" means the Commissioners' 1980 Standard Ordinary Life Valuation
Mortality Tables (1980 CSO) without ten-year selection factors, incorporated into the 1980
amendments to the NAIC Standard Valuation Law approved in December 1983; and
   (3) "preneed insurance" is any life insurance policy or certificate that is issued in combination

with, in support of, with an assignment to, or as a guarantee for a prearrangement agreement for
goods and services to be provided at the time of and immediately following the death of the insured.
Goods and services may include, but are not limited to embalming, cremation, body preparation,
viewing or visitation, coffin or urn, memorial stone, and transportation of the deceased. The status
of the policy or contract as preneed insurance is determined at the time of issue in accordance with
the policy form filing.
   Subd. 2. Minimum valuation mortality standards. For preneed insurance contracts, the
minimum mortality standard for determining reserve liabilities and nonforfeiture values for both
male and female insureds shall be the Ultimate 1980 CSO.
    Subd. 3. Minimum valuation interest rate standards. (a) The interest rates used in
determining the minimum standard for valuation of preneed insurance shall be the calendar year
statutory valuation interest rates as defined in section 61A.25.
    (b) The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for nonforfeiture values for
preneed insurance shall be the calendar year statutory nonforfeiture interest rates as defined in
section 61A.24.
    Subd. 4. Minimum valuation method standards. (a) The method used in determining the
standard for the minimum valuation of reserves of preneed insurance shall be the method defined in

   EFFECTIVE DATE; TRANSITION RULES. (a) This section is effective January 1, 2009,
and applies to preneed insurance policies and certificates issued on or after that date.
    (b) For preneed insurance policies issued on or after the effective date of this section and before
January 1, 2012, the 2001 CSO may be used as the minimum standard for reserves and minimum
standard for nonforfeiture benefits for both male and female insureds.
    (c) If an insurer elects to use the 2001 CSO as a minimum standard for any policy issued on or
after the effective date of this section and before January 1, 2012, the insurer shall provide, as a part
of the actuarial opinion memorandum submitted in support of the company's asset adequacy testing,
an annual written notification to the domiciliary commissioner. The notification shall include:
   (1) a complete list of all preneed policy forms that use the 2001 CSO as a minimum standard;
    (2) a certification signed by the appointed actuary stating that the reserve methodology employed
by the company in determining reserves for the preneed policies issued after the effective date and
using the 2001 CSO as a minimum standard, develops adequate reserves (For the purposes of this
certification, the preneed insurance policies using the 2001 CSO as a minimum standard cannot be
aggregated with any other policies.); and
    (3) supporting information regarding the adequacy of reserves for preneed insurance policies
issued after the effective date of this section and using the 2001 CSO as a minimum standard for
reserves.
   (d) Preneed insurance policies issued on or after January 1, 2012, must use the Ultimate 1980

    If the insurer that issued your life, annuity, or health insurance policy becomes impaired or
insolvent, you are entitled to compensation for your policy from the assets of that insurer. The
amount you recover will depend on the financial condition of the insurer.
   In addition, residents of Minnesota who purchase life insurance, annuities, or health insurance
from insurance companies authorized to do business in Minnesota are protected, SUBJECT TO
LIMITS AND EXCLUSIONS, in the event the insurer becomes financially impaired or insolvent.
This protection is provided by the Minnesota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association.

shall be prorated among all claimants. These are the maximum claim amounts. Coverage by the
guaranty association is also subject to other substantial limitations and exclusions and requires
continued residency in Minnesota. If your claim exceeds the guaranty association's limits, you may
still recover a part or all of that amount from the proceeds of the liquidation of the insolvent insurer,
if any exist. Funds to pay claims may not be immediately available. The guaranty association
assesses insurers licensed to sell life and health insurance in Minnesota after the insolvency occurs.
Claims are paid from this assessment.
  THE COVERAGE PROVIDED BY THE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION IS NOT A
SUBSTITUTE FOR USING CARE IN SELECTING INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE
WELL MANAGED AND FINANCIALLY STABLE. IN SELECTING AN INSURANCE

belonging to the insured. Secondary property means any real or personal property that is not

write for secondary property is 25 percent of the total limit of liability of the policy issued to an
insured covering the qualified property.

including qualified or secondary property, subject to the limitations in subdivision 1, paragraph (b),
located outside the limits of the territory in which the company is authorized by its certificate or
articles of incorporation to transact business, if the company is already covering qualified property
belonging to the insured, inside the limits of the company's territory.
   (d) A township mutual fire insurance company may insure property temporarily outside of the
authorized territory of the township mutual fire insurance company.

or reinsure a single risk or hazard in a larger sum than the greater of $3,000, or one tenth of its net
assets plus two tenths of a mill of its insurance in force; provided that no portion of any such risk or
hazard which shall have been reinsured, as authorized by the laws of this state, shall be included in
determining the limitation of risk prescribed by this subdivision.

    Subd. 3. Corrective action plan; commissioner's notification. Within 30 days after the
submission by a township mutual fire insurance company of a corrective action plan, the
commissioner shall notify the insurer whether the plan may be implemented or is, in the judgment
of the commissioner, unsatisfactory. If the commissioner determines the plan is unsatisfactory, the
notification to the company must set forth the reasons for the determination, and may set forth
proposed revisions that will render the plan satisfactory in the judgment of the commissioner. Upon
notification from the commissioner, the insurer shall prepare a revised corrective action plan that
may incorporate by reference any revisions proposed by the commissioner, and shall submit the
revised plan to the commissioner within 45 days.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 45.011, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Scope. As used in chapters 45 to 83, 155A, 332, 332A, 332B, 345, and 359,
and sections 325D.30 to 325D.42, 326B.802 to 326B.885, and 386.61 to 386.78, unless the context

the public examiner, and shall take over all duties in relation to state banks, savings banks, trust
companies, savings associations, and other financial institutions within the state which, prior to
the enactment of chapter 201, were imposed upon the public examiner. The commissioner of
commerce shall exercise a constant supervision, either personally or through the examiners herein
provided for, over the books and affairs of all state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings
associations, credit unions, industrial loan and thrift companies, and other financial institutions
doing business within this state; and shall, through examiners, examine each financial institution at
least once every 24 calendar months. In satisfying this examination requirement, the commissioner
may accept reports of examination prepared by a federal agency having comparable supervisory
powers and examination procedures. With the exception of industrial loan and thrift companies
which do not have deposit liabilities and licensed regulated lenders, it shall be the principal
purpose of these examinations to inspect and verify the assets and liabilities of each and so far
investigate the character and value of the assets of each institution as to determine with reasonable
certainty that the values are correctly carried on its books. Assets and liabilities shall be verified in
accordance with methods of procedure which the commissioner may determine to be adequate to
carry out the intentions of this section. It shall be the further purpose of these examinations to assess
the adequacy of capital protection and the capacity of the institution to meet usual and reasonably
anticipated deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments without resorting to excessive
borrowing or sale of assets at a significant loss, and to investigate each institution's compliance
with applicable laws and rules. Based on the examination findings, the commissioner shall make
a determination as to whether the institution is being operated in a safe and sound manner. None
of the above provisions limits the commissioner in making additional examinations as deemed
necessary or advisable. The commissioner shall investigate the methods of operation and conduct
of these institutions and their systems of accounting, to ascertain whether these methods and
systems are in accordance with law and sound banking principles. The commissioner may make
requirements as to records as deemed necessary to facilitate the carrying out of the commissioner's
duties and to properly protect the public interest. The commissioner may examine, or cause to be
examined by these examiners, on oath, any officer, director, trustee, owner, agent, clerk, customer,
or depositor of any financial institution touching the affairs and business thereof, and may issue, or
cause to be issued by the examiners, subpoenas, and administer, or cause to be administered by
the examiners, oaths. In case of any refusal to obey any subpoena issued under the commissioner's
direction, the refusal may at once be reported to the district court of the district in which the bank
or other financial institution is located, and this court shall enforce obedience to these subpoenas
in the manner provided by law for enforcing obedience to subpoenas of the court. In all matters
relating to official duties, the commissioner of commerce has the power possessed by courts of law
to issue subpoenas and cause them to be served and enforced, and all officers, directors, trustees,
and employees of state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings associations, and other
financial institutions within the state, and all persons having dealings with or knowledge of the
affairs or methods of these institutions, shall afford reasonable facilities for these examinations,
make returns and reports to the commissioner of commerce as the commissioner may require;
attend and answer, under oath, the commissioner's lawful inquiries; produce and exhibit any books,
accounts, documents, and property as the commissioner may desire to inspect, and in all things aid
the commissioner in the performance of duties.

performance of duties, the commissioner finds it necessary to make a special investigation of any
financial institution under the commissioner's supervision, and other than a complete examination,
the commissioner shall make a charge therefor to include only the necessary costs thereof. Such a
fee shall be payable to the commissioner on the commissioner's making a request for payment.

sales presentation during the call, but who will complete the sales presentation at a later face-to-face
meeting between the solicitor who makes the call and the prospective purchaser; or
    (iii) by a political party as defined under section 200.02, subdivision 6.

    (1) charge an origination fee, which may be designated by the debt settlement services provider
as nonrefundable, of:
   (i) $200 on aggregate debt of less than $20,000; or
   (ii) $400 on aggregate debt of $20,000 or more;
   (2) charge a monthly fee of:
   (i) no greater than $50 per month on aggregate debt of less than $40,000; and
   (ii) no greater than $60 per month on aggregate debt of $40,000 or more; and
    (3) charge a settlement fee for the remainder of the allowable fees, which may be demanded and
collected no earlier than upon delivery to the debt settlement services provider by a creditor of a bona
fide written settlement offer consistent with the terms of the debt settlement services agreement. A
settlement fee may be assessed for each debt settled, but the sum total of the origination fee, the
monthly fee, and the settlement fee may not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate debt.
    (b) When a settlement offer is obtained by a debt settlement services provider from a creditor,
the collection of any monthly fees shall cease beginning the month following the month in which
the settlement offer was obtained by the debt settlement services provider.
    (c) In no event may more than 40 percent of the total amount of fees allowable be claimed,
demanded, charged, collected, or received by a debt settlement services provider any earlier than
upon delivery to the debt settlement services provider by a creditor of a bona fide written settlement
offer consistent with the terms of the debt settlement services agreement.
   Subd. 3. Fees as a percentage of savings. (a) The total amount of the fees claimed, demanded,

charged, collected, or received under this subdivision shall be calculated as 30 percent of the savings
actually negotiated by the debt settlement services provider. The savings shall be calculated as the
difference between the aggregate debt that is stated in the debt settlement services agreement at the
time of its execution and total amount that the debtor actually pays to settle all the debts stated in the
debt settlement services agreement, provided that only savings resulting from concessions actually
negotiated by the debt settlement services provider may be counted. A debt settlement services
provider that calculates fees as a percentage of debt may:
    (1) charge an origination fee, which may be designated by the debt settlement services provider
as nonrefundable, of:
   (i) $300 on aggregate debt of less than $20,000; or
   (ii) $500 on aggregate debt of $20,000 or more;
   (2) charge a monthly fee of:
   (i) no greater than $65 on aggregate debt of less than $40,000; and
   (ii) no greater than $75 on aggregate debt of $40,000 or more; and
    (3) charge a settlement fee for the remainder of the allowable fees, which may be demanded
and collected no earlier than upon delivery to the debt settlement services provider by a creditor of
a bona fide, final written settlement offer consistent with the terms of the debt settlement services
agreement. A settlement fee may be assessed for each debt settled, but the sum total of the origination
fee, the monthly fee, and the settlement fee may not exceed 30 percent of the savings, as calculated
under paragraph (a).
    (b) The collection of monthly fees shall cease under this subdivision when the total of monthly
fees and the origination fee equals 50 percent of the total fees allowable under this subdivision. For
the purposes of this subdivision, 50 percent of the total fees allowable shall assume a settlement of
50 cents on the dollar.
    (c) In no event may more than 50 percent of the total amount of fees allowable be claimed,
demanded, charged, collected, or received by a debt settlement services provider any earlier than
upon delivery to the debt settlement services provider by a creditor of a bona fide, final written
settlement offer consistent with the terms of the debt settlement services agreement.
    Subd. 4. Fees exclusive. No fees, charges, assessments, or any other compensation may be
claimed, demanded, charged, collected, or received other than the fees allowed under this section.
Any fees collected in excess of those allowed under this section must be immediately returned to
the debtor.
    Subd. 5. Withdrawal of creditor. Whenever a creditor withdraws from a debt settlement
services plan, the debt settlement services provider must promptly notify the debtor of the
withdrawal, identify the creditor, and inform the debtor of the right to modify the debt settlement
services agreement, unless at least 50 percent of the listed creditors withdraw, in which case the
debt settlement services provider must notify the debtor of the debtor's right to cancel. In no case
may this notice be provided more than 15 days after the debt settlement services provider learns of
the creditor's decision to withdraw from a plan.

     Subd. 6. Timely notification of settlement offer. A debt settlement services provider must make
all reasonable efforts to notify the debtor within 24 hours of a settlement offer made by a creditor.
   Sec. 27. [332B.10] PROHIBITIONS.
   No debt settlement services provider shall:
   (1) engage in any activity, act, or omission prohibited under section 332A.14;
    (2) promise, guarantee, or directly or indirectly imply, infer, or in any manner represent that any
debt will be settled prior to the presentation to the debtor of an offer by the creditors participating
in the debt settlement plan to settle;
   (3) misrepresent the timing of negotiations with creditors;
   (4) imply, infer, or in any manner represent that:

   (iv) the debtor is not subject to legal action; and
   (v) the debtor will not be subject to tax consequences for the portion of any debts forgiven;
    (5) execute a power of attorney or any other agreement, oral or written, express or implied, that

the creditor's right at any time to communicate with the debtor;
   (6) exercise or attempt to exercise a power of attorney after an individual has terminated an
agreement;
    (7) state, imply, infer, or, in any other manner, indicate that entering into a debt settlement
services agreement or settling debts will either have no effect on, or improve, the debtor's credit,
credit rating, and credit score;
   (8) challenge a debt without the written consent of the debtor;
   (9) make any false or misleading claim regarding a creditor's right to collect a debt;
    (10) falsely represent that the debt settlement services provider can negotiate better settlement

    (11) provide or offer to provide legal advice or legal services unless the person providing or
offering to provide legal advice is licensed to practice law in the state;
    (12) misrepresent that it is authorized or competent to furnish legal advice or perform legal
services; and
    (13) settle a debt or lead an individual to believe that a payment to a creditor is in settlement of
a debt to the creditor unless, at the time of settlement, the individual receives a certification from
the creditor that the payment is in full settlement of the debt.

  Sec. 28. [332B.11] ADVERTISEMENT AND SOLICITATION OF DEBT SETTLEMENT
SERVICES.
      Subdivision 1. Advertisement. No debt settlement services provider or lead generator may:
    (1) make any false, deceptive, or misleading statements or omissions about the rates, terms,
or conditions of an actual or proposed debt settlement services plan, or create the likelihood of
consumer confusion or misunderstanding regarding its services;
    (2) represent that the debt settlement services provider is a nonprofit, not-for-profit, or has similar
status or characteristics if some or all of the debt settlement services will be provided by a for-profit
company that is a controlling or affiliated party to the debt settlement services provider;
    (3) make any communication that gives the impression that the debt settlement services provider
is acting on behalf of a government agency; or
      (4) represent, claim, imply, or infer that secured debts may be settled.
    Subd. 2. Solicitation by lead generators. (a) In all print, electronic, and nonprint solicitations,
including Web sites and radio or television advertising, a lead generator must prominently make the
following verbatim disclosure: "This company does not actually provide any debt settlement, debt
consolidation, or other credit counseling services. We ONLY refer you to companies that want to
provide some or all of those services."
      (b) A lead generator may not, in any advertising or solicitation to debtors:
      (1) represent that any service is guaranteed; or
   (2) misrepresent the benefits of its services or debt settlement or consolidation in comparison to
credit counseling, debt management, or bankruptcy.
      Sec. 29. [332B.12] DEBT SETTLEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT RESCISSION.
    Any debtor has the right to rescind any debt settlement services agreement with a debt settlement
services provider that commits a material violation of this chapter. On rescission, all fees paid to
the debt settlement services provider or any other person other than creditors of the debtor must
be returned to the debtor entering into the debt settlement services agreement within ten days of
rescission of the debt settlement services agreement.
      Sec. 30. [332B.13] ENFORCEMENT; REMEDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Violation as deceptive practice. A violation of any of the provisions of this

private right of action under section 8.31 by an aggrieved debtor is in the public interest.
    Subd. 2. Private right of action. (a) A debt settlement provider who fails to comply with any
of the provisions of this chapter, or a lead generator who violates section 332B.11, is liable under

in a class action for the amount that each named plaintiff could recover under paragraph (a), clause
(1), and to the other class members for such amount as the court may allow.
    (c) In determining the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider, among other
relevant factors:
   (1) the frequency, nature, and persistence of noncompliance;
   (2) the extent to which the noncompliance was intentional; and
   (3) in the case of a class action, the number of debtors adversely affected.
    (d) A plaintiff or class successful in a legal or equitable action under this section is entitled to
the costs of the action, plus reasonable attorney fees.
    Subd. 3. Injunctive relief. (a) A debtor may sue a debt settlement services provider for
temporary or permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief to prevent violations of
any provision of this chapter. A court must grant injunctive relief on a showing that the debt
settlement services provider has violated any provision of this chapter, or in the case of a temporary
injunction, on a showing that the debtor is likely to prevail on allegations that the debt settlement
services provider violated any provision of this chapter.
    (b) A debtor may sue a lead generator for temporary or permanent injunctive or other
appropriate equitable relief to prevent violations of section 332B.11. A court must grant injunctive
relief on a showing that the lead generator has violated section 332B.11, or in the case of a
temporary injunction, on a showing that the debtor is likely to prevail on allegations that the lead
generator violated section 332B.11.
    Subd. 4. Remedies cumulative. The remedies provided in this section are cumulative and do
not restrict any remedy that is otherwise available. The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive
and are in addition to any other requirements, rights, remedies, and penalties provided by law.
   Subd. 5. Public enforcement. The attorney general shall enforce this chapter under section 8.31.
   Sec. 31. [332B.14] INVESTIGATIONS.
    At any reasonable time, the commissioner may examine the books and records of every
registrant and of any person engaged in the business of providing debt settlement services. The
commissioner, once during any calendar year, may require the submission of an audit prepared by a
certified public accountant of the books and records of each registrant. If the registrant has, within
one year previous to the commissioner's demand, had an audit prepared for some other purpose,
this audit may be submitted to satisfy the requirement of this section. The commissioner may
investigate any complaint concerning violations of this chapter and may require the attendance and
sworn testimony of witnesses and the production of documents."
