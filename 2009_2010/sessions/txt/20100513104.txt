The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 3046 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 3046 be further amended as follows:

   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 5c. Large solar electric generating plant. (a) For the purpose of this subdivision:
    (1) "project" means a solar electric generation project consisting of arrays of solar photovoltaic
cells with a capacity of up to two megawatts located on the site of a closed landfill in Olmsted county
owned by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency; and
    (2) "cooperative electric association" means a generation and transmission cooperative electric
association that has a member distribution cooperative association to which it provides wholesale
electric service in whose service territory a project is located.
   (b) A cooperative electric association may elect to count all of its purchases of electric energy
from a project toward only one of the following:
   (1) its energy-savings goal under subdivision 1c; or
   (2) its energy objective or standard under section 216B.1691.
    (c) A cooperative electric association may include in its conservation plan purchases of electric
energy from a project. The cost-effectiveness of project purchases may be determined by a different
standard than for other energy conservation improvements under this section if the commissioner
determines that doing so is in the public interest in order to encourage solar energy. The kilowatt
hours of solar energy purchased by a cooperative electric association from a project may count for
up to 33 percent of its one percent savings goal under subdivision 1c or up to 22 percent of its 1.5
percent savings goal under that section. Expenditures made by a cooperative association for the
purchase of energy from a project may not be used to meet the revenue expenditure requirements
of subdivisions 1a and 1b.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."
   Delete the title and insert:
   "A bill for an act relating to energy; providing for large solar energy electric generation
demonstration conservation improvement project; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, section
216B.241, by adding a subdivision."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.
   Senate Conferees: Dan Sparks, Yvonne Prettner Solon, David Senjem
   House Conferees: Andy Welti, Bill Hilty, Randy Demmer
   Senator Sparks moved that the foregoing recommendations and Conference Committee Report
on S.F. No. 3046 be now adopted, and that the bill be repassed as amended by the Conference
Committee. The motion prevailed. So the recommendations and Conference Committee Report
were adopted.
     S.F. No. 3046 was read the third time, as amended by the Conference Committee, and placed on
its repassage.

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Informed consent for insurance purposes. Informed consent for insurance purposes
must comply with this subdivision, unless otherwise prescribed by the HIPAA Standards for Privacy
of Individually Identifiable Health Information, Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, section 164.
Informed consent for insurance purposes is not considered to have been given by an individual
subject of data by the signing of a statement authorizing a government entity to disclose information
about the individual to an insurer or its authorized representative, unless the statement is:
      (1) in plain language;
      (2) dated;
    (3) specific in designating the government entity the data subject is authorizing to disclose
information about the data subject;
      (4) specific as to the nature of the information the data subject is authorizing to be disclosed;
      (5) specific as to the persons to whom the data subject is authorizing information to be disclosed;
   (6) specific as to the purpose or purposes for which the information may be used by any of the
persons named in clause (5), both at the time of the disclosure and at any time in the future; and
   (7) specific as to its expiration date, which must be within a reasonable period of time, not to
exceed one year.
    Notwithstanding clause (7), in the case of authorizations given in connection with applications
for life insurance or noncancelable or guaranteed renewable health insurance that is so identified,
the expiration date must not exceed two years after the date of the policy. An authorization in
connection with medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under chapter 256L or
for individual education plan health-related services provided by a school district under section
125A.21, subdivision 2, is valid during all terms of eligibility.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

with a government entity. Personnel data includes data submitted by an employee to a government
entity as part of an organized self-evaluation effort by the government entity to request suggestions
from all employees on ways to cut costs, make government more efficient, or improve the operation

suggestion except the identity of the employee making the suggestion.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.43, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Public data. (a) Except for employees described in subdivision 5 and subject to
the limitations described in subdivision 5a, the following personnel data on current and former
employees, volunteers, and independent contractors of a government entity is public:
    (1) name; employee identification number, which must not be the employee's Social Security
number; actual gross salary; salary range; terms and conditions of employment relationship; contract
fees; actual gross pension; the value and nature of employer paid fringe benefits; and the basis for
and the amount of any added remuneration, including expense reimbursement, in addition to salary;
   (2) job title and bargaining unit; job description; education and training background; and
previous work experience;
     (3) date of first and last employment;
   (4) the existence and status of any complaints or charges against the employee, regardless of
whether the complaint or charge resulted in a disciplinary action;
   (5) the final disposition of any disciplinary action together with the specific reasons for the action
and data documenting the basis of the action, excluding data that would identify confidential sources
who are employees of the public body;
    (6) the terms of any agreement settling any dispute arising out of an employment relationship,
including a buyout agreement as defined in section 123B.143, subdivision 2, paragraph (a); except
that the agreement must include specific reasons for the agreement if it involves the payment of
more than $10,000 of public money;
   (7) work location; a work telephone number; badge number; work-related continuing education;
and honors and awards received; and
   (8) payroll time sheets or other comparable data that are only used to account for employee's
work time for payroll purposes, except to the extent that release of time sheet data would reveal the
employee's reasons for the use of sick or other medical leave or other not public data.
     (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a final disposition occurs when the government entity makes
its final decision about the disciplinary action, regardless of the possibility of any later proceedings
or court proceedings. ­        In

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.87, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

individual to be evaluated prior to closing a meeting. At its next open meeting, the public body shall
summarize its conclusions regarding the evaluation. A meeting must be open at the request of the
individual who is the subject of the meeting.
    (b) Meetings may be closed if the closure is expressly authorized by statute or permitted by the
attorney-client privilege.
   (c) A public body may close a meeting:
    (1) to determine the asking price for real or personal property to be sold by the government
entity;
   (2) to review confidential or protected nonpublic appraisal data under section 13.44, subdivision
104TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010                                         11641

3; and
   (3) to develop or consider offers or counteroffers for the purchase or sale of real or personal
property.
    Before holding a closed meeting under this paragraph, the public body must identify on
the record the particular real or personal property that is the subject of the closed meeting. The
proceedings of a meeting closed under this paragraph must be tape recorded at the expense of the
public body. The recording must be preserved for eight years after the date of the meeting and
made available to the public after all real or personal property discussed at the meeting has been
purchased or sold or the governing body has abandoned the purchase or sale. The real or personal
property that is the subject of the closed meeting must be specifically identified on the tape. A list of
members and all other persons present at the closed meeting must be made available to the public
after the closed meeting. If an action is brought claiming that public business other than discussions
allowed under this paragraph was transacted at a closed meeting held under this paragraph during
the time when the tape is not available to the public, section 13D.03, subdivision 3, applies.
An agreement reached that is based on an offer considered at a closed meeting is contingent on
approval of the public body at an open meeting. The actual purchase or sale must be approved at an
open meeting after the notice period required by statute or the governing body's internal procedures,
and the purchase price or sale price is public data.
    (d) Meetings may be closed to receive security briefings and reports, to discuss issues related
to security systems, to discuss emergency response procedures and to discuss security deficiencies
in or recommendations regarding public services, infrastructure and facilities, if disclosure of the
information discussed would pose a danger to public safety or compromise security procedures or
responses. Financial issues related to security matters must be discussed and all related financial
decisions must be made at an open meeting. Before closing a meeting under this paragraph,
the public body, in describing the subject to be discussed, must refer to the facilities, systems,
procedures, services, or infrastructures to be considered during the closed meeting. A closed
meeting must be tape recorded at the expense of the governing body, and the recording must be
preserved for at least four years.

temporary classification, which if not granted could adversely affect the health, safety or welfare
of the public, or the data subject's well-being or reputation.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
      Subd. 4. Procedure when classification affects others. If the commissioner determines that
an application for temporary classification involves data which would reasonably be classified in
the same manner by all government entities similar to the one which made the application, the
commissioner may approve or disapprove the classification for data of the kind which is the subject
of the application for the use of all government entities similar to the applicant. If requested in
the application, the commissioner may also determine that the data classification affects similar
government entities. On deeming this approach advisable, the commissioner shall provide notice
of the proposed action by publication in the State Register within ­e                                   t­­n 15 days of receiving the
application. Within 30 days after publication in the State Register an affected government entity
or the public may submit comments on the ­                     co­m­m  i­­

shall consider any comments received when granting or denying a classification for data of the kind
which is the subject of the application, for the use of all government entities similar to the applicant.
Within 45 days after the close of the period for submitting comment, the commissioner shall grant or
disapprove the application. Applications processed under this subdivision shall be either approved
or disapproved by the commissioner within 90 days of the receipt of the application. For purposes
of subdivision 1, the data which is the subject of the classification shall be deemed to be classified
as set forth in the application for a period of 90 days, or until the application is disapproved or
granted by the commissioner, whichever is earlier. ­                      I­

pilot project is established to transfer certain reserve deposits of selected institutions from the
state treasury to a community financial institution. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section
16A.27, by January 2, 2011, the commissioner of management and budget shall transfer the
specified amount of board-required reserve funds of colleges and universities selected by the board
of trustees under subdivision 2, to a community financial institution designated for each of the
participating colleges and universities.
    Subd. 2. Participating colleges and universities. By August 15, 2010, colleges and universities
may apply to the Board of Trustees of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities for participation
in the pilot project. Each applicant must designate one or more community financial institutions for
the deposit of a specified amount of board-required reserves, with the terms of the deposit for each
designated community financial institution. The designated community financial institution must be
located in the geographic area of a participating campus. From the applicants, the board shall select
up to eight postsecondary institutions to participate in the local deposit pilot project. In making its
selection, the board must consider the size of the institution's reserves and the terms offered by
the designated community financial institutions. Unless there are not sufficient applicants, two-year
and four-year institutions must be selected to participate in the pilot project and the majority of the
selected institutions must be located in greater Minnesota.
    By December 1, 2010, the board must notify the commissioner of management and budget of
the participating colleges and universities, the deposit amount for each institution and the associated
community financial institutions. The pilot project shall provide for the transfer of deposits for no
more than the period January 2, 2011, to December 31, 2012.
    Subd. 3. Community financial institution. As used in this section, "community financial
institution" means a federally insured bank or credit union, chartered as a bank or credit union by
the state of Minnesota or the United States, that is headquartered in Minnesota and that has no
more than $2,500,000,000 in assets.
    Subd. 4. Evaluation and report. The commissioner of management and budget and the
board of trustees shall independently evaluate the effectiveness or harm of the local deposit pilot
project in increasing the use of community financial institutions and providing wider distribution
of the economic benefit of the deposit of postsecondary reserves. Each evaluation must include
the participating colleges, universities, and community financial institutions. The commissioner
of management and budget and the board shall report on the pilot project evaluation to the
appropriate committees of the legislature by February 1, 2013, with recommendations on the future
implementation of the pilot project.
   Sec. 34. NANOTECHNOLOGY REPORT.

DISCLOSURE LAW.
    The Office of Higher Education shall monitor the implementation of the Higher Education
Opportunity Act, Public Law 110-315, as it relates to disclosure of textbook pricing and other
information to students. The monitoring shall be done in a manner that the office determines will
allow it to determine whether students are receiving information required or encouraged to be
disclosed to students under the act. The office shall report the results of its monitoring along with
any recommendations for legislation to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with primary jurisdiction over higher education finance and policy by February 1, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 37. REDUCTION IN GRANTS FOR INSUFFICIENT APPROPRIATIONS.
     In fiscal year 2011, the dollar amount reductions in state grants under Minnesota Statutes, section
136A.121, subdivision 7, may be approximately equal for the surcharge on family responsibility
and the percentage increase on the assigned student responsibility. The Minnesota Office of Higher
Education may reserve up to five percent of the projected demand for grant awards in fiscal year
2011 to manage uncertainty of demand based on enrollment or income changes of applicants. After
reduced grant awards are made for fiscal year 2011, the office must distribute any remaining funds to
increase the living and miscellaneous expenses allowance consistent with the office's distribution of
surplus appropriations under Minnesota Statutes, section 136A.121, subdivision 7a; provided that
if the office determines that the remaining funds are less than $1,500,000 the office may, in lieu of
increasing the allowance, transfer all of the remaining funds to the state work-study program.
  Sec. 38. CREDIT              TRANSFER;         MINNESOTA           STATE      COLLEGES          AND
UNIVERSITIES.
   (a) The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities must develop and
implement a plan to improve credit transfers within the system. At a minimum, the board must:
   (1) enhance information on transferring and tracking credits;
   (2) improve training for all staff involved with credit transfer;
   (3) identify discrepancies in transferring and accepting credits by institutions within the system
and devise methods to improve the uniform treatment of credit transfers; and
   (4) require, to the extent feasible, institutional rather than student obligation to provide prompt
required documentation for course equivalency determinations.
   (b) The board may convene working groups of affected faculty, staff, students, and
administrators representing institutions and academic and technical disciplines in the system to
work on issues and barriers to credit transfer.

    (c) The board must provide systemwide transfer information on the Internet that is easily
accessible and maintained in a current and accurate status. Each system college and university shall
post information necessary to determine the transferability of course credits on their institutional
Web sites. The working groups must develop a template to be used by the colleges and universities
to ensure consistency in the information available to students. The links to each institution's
informational Web site shall be submitted to the office of the chancellor for publication on the
MinnesotaTransfer.org Web site.
    (d) The board shall report on February 15, 2011, and annually thereafter through 2014, on its
activities to achieve the credit transfer goals in this section and the results of those activities. The
report shall be made to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with
primary jurisdiction over higher education policy and finance. The goals of this section should be
fully achieved as soon as possible, but no later than the start of the 2015-2016 academic year."

                                                                                      May 13, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
   I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 335, Senate File 2790.
    The bill relaxes the current permanent disqualification standards for persons with violent
criminal histories who want to work in DHS-licensed positions. In 2005, new protections were part
of significant public safety legislation regarding sex offender management.
    Changing those provisions takes the state backwards, by permitting people with the most serious
criminal histories to work directly with children and vulnerable adults in licensed settings and
unlicensed personal care attendant situations. The extensive list of crimes involved includes: first,
second and third degree murder; first and second degree manslaughter; criminal sexual predatory
conduct; criminal sexual conduct in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth degree; aggravated
robbery; drive-by shootings; first and second degree assault; kidnapping; and first degree arson.
    The bill also unwisely relaxes current expungement law. Expungements should remain an
extraordinary remedy. The bill permits the sealing of not merely a conviction record but "any type
11668                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [104TH DAY

of delinquency or criminal record relating to a juvenile matter" and allows for sealing of all records
relating to an arrest, indictment or information, trial, or verdict if the petitioner has successfully
completed the terms of a diversion program or stay of adjudication and has not been charged with a
new crime for at least one year since completion of the diversion or stay. The bill waives the filing
fee in a great number of situations and excludes the public from hearings on petitions to expunge
"any type" of record relating to a juvenile matter.
    These changes to the expungement law would allow persons to receive expungements for very
serious crimes (such as crimes requiring registration under the predatory offender registration
statute). Current law does not allow such expungements.
   Furthermore, in cases involving stays of adjudication or diversions, this bill would direct the
courts to seal the record without even requiring the filing of a petition. In many situations, this bill
would place the burden of proof for expungement on prosecutors rather than offenders - where it
should be. Also, individuals currently pay a filing fee when seeking an expungement of criminal
records, and in most cases make their cases in open court. This bill would change those practices.
   This legislation is dangerous and misguided. The bill would potentially expose children and
vulnerable adults to violent, dangerous sex offenders and it represents a serious step backwards for
public safety in Minnesota. The bill is vetoed as a result.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2790 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

impose restrictions suitable to the licensee's driving ability or other restrictions applicable to the
licensee as the commissioner may determine to be appropriate to assure the safe operation of a
motor vehicle by the licensee.
    (b) Pursuant to Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, section 383.95, if an applicant for a
commercial driver's license either does not successfully complete the air brake component of the
knowledge test, or does not successfully complete the skills test in a vehicle equipped with air
brakes as such tests are prescribed in Code of Federal Regulations, title 49, part 384, the department
shall indicate on the class C, class B, or class A commercial driver's license, if issued, that the
individual is restricted from operating a commercial motor vehicle equipped with air brakes.
    (c) Upon receiving satisfactory evidence of any violation of the restrictions on the license, the
commissioner may suspend or revoke the license. A license suspension under this section is subject
to section 171.18, subdivisions 2 and 3.
    (d) A person who drives, operates, or is in physical control of a motor vehicle while in violation
of the restrictions imposed in a restricted driver's license issued to that person under this section is
guilty of a crime as follows:
    (1) if the restriction relates to the possession or consumption of alcohol or controlled substances,
the person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor; or
   (2) if the restriction relates to another matter, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (e) It is a misdemeanor for a person who holds a restricted license issued under section 171.306 to
drive, operate, or be in physical control of any motor vehicle that is not equipped with a functioning
ignition interlock device certified by the commissioner.
    Subd. 3. No-alcohol restriction. (a) As used in this subdivision, "impaired driving incident" has
the meaning given in section 169A.03, subdivision 22.
    (b) Upon proper application by a person having a valid driver's license containing the restriction
that the person must not consume alcohol or controlled substances, who has not been documented
as having consumed alcohol or having possessed or used a controlled substance within the past ten
years, and whose driving record contains no impaired driving incident within the past ten years, the
commissioner must remove the no-alcohol/controlled substance restriction on the person's driving
record and issue to the person a duplicate driver's license that does not show that restriction.

following conditions:
   (1) if the driver's livelihood or attendance at a chemical dependency treatment or counseling
program depends upon the use of the driver's license;
    (2) if the use of a driver's license by a homemaker is necessary to prevent the substantial
disruption of the education, medical, or nutritional needs of the family of the homemaker; or
    (3) if attendance at a postsecondary institution of education by an enrolled student of that
institution depends upon the use of the driver's license.
    (b) The commissioner in issuing a limited license may impose such conditions and limitations
as in the commissioner's judgment are necessary to the interests of the public safety and welfare
including reexamination as to the driver's qualifications. The license may be limited to the operation
of particular vehicles, to particular classes and times of operation, and to particular conditions
of traffic. The commissioner may require that an applicant for a limited license affirmatively
demonstrate that use of public transportation or carpooling as an alternative to a limited license
would be a significant hardship.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision,
                                        ­: (1) "homemaker" refers to the person primarily performing
the domestic tasks in a household of residents consisting of at least the person and the person's
dependent child or other dependents; and (2) "twice the legal limit" means an alcohol concentration
of two times the limit specified in section 169A.20, subdivision 1, clause (5).
   (d) The limited license issued by the commissioner shall clearly indicate the limitations imposed
and the driver operating under the limited license shall have the license in possession at all times
when operating as a driver.
    (e) In determining whether to issue a limited license, the commissioner shall consider the number
and the seriousness of prior convictions and the entire driving record of the driver and shall consider
the number of miles driven by the driver annually.
    (f) If the person's driver's license or permit to drive has been revoked under section 169.792
or 169.797, the commissioner may only issue a limited license to the person after the person has
presented an insurance identification card, policy, or written statement indicating that the driver or
owner has insurance coverage satisfactory to the commissioner of public safety. The commissioner
of public safety may require the insurance identification card provided to satisfy this subdivision be
certified by the insurance company to be noncancelable for a period not to exceed 12 months.
   (g) The limited license issued by the commissioner to a person under section 171.186,
subdivision 4, must expire 90 days after the date it is issued. The commissioner must not issue a
limited license to a person who previously has been issued a limited license under section 171.186,
subdivision 4.
   (h) The commissioner shall not issue a limited driver's license to any person described in section
171.04, subdivision 1, clause (6), (7), (8), ­

ignition interlock program. The manufacturer of a device must apply annually for certification of
the device by submitting the form prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall require
manufacturers of certified devices to:
    (1) provide device installation, servicing, and monitoring to indigent program participants at a
discounted rate, according to the standards established by the commissioner; and
    (2) include in an ignition interlock device contract a provision that a program participant who
voluntarily terminates participation in the program is only liable for servicing and monitoring costs
incurred during the time the device is installed on the motor vehicle, regardless of whether the term
of the contract has expired.

device-equipped motor vehicle or vehicles operated by the program participant to an approved
service provider for device calibration and servicing according to the schedule established by the
commissioner and as indicated by the ignition interlock device.
    Subd. 4. Issuance of restricted license. (a) The commissioner shall issue a class D driver's
license, subject to the applicable limitations and restrictions of this section, to a program participant
who meets the requirements of this section and the program guidelines. The commissioner shall not

ignition interlock device has been installed on the participant's motor vehicle at an installation
service center designated by the device's manufacturer; and (2) the participant has insurance
coverage on the vehicle equipped with the ignition interlock device. The commissioner shall
require the participant to present an insurance identification card, policy, or written statement as
proof of insurance coverage, and may require the insurance identification card provided be certified
by the insurance company to be noncancelable for a period not to exceed 12 months. A license
issued under authority of this section must contain a restriction prohibiting the program participant
from driving, operating, or being in physical control of any motor vehicle not equipped with a
functioning ignition interlock device certified by the commissioner. A participant may drive an
employer-owned vehicle not equipped with an interlock device while in the normal course and
scope of employment duties pursuant to the program guidelines established by the commissioner
and with the employer's written consent.
    (b) A program participant whose driver's license has been revoked under section 169A.52,
subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (1), (2), or (3), or subdivision 4, paragraph (a), clause (1),
(2), or (3), or section 169A.54, subdivision 1, clause (1), (2), or (3), may apply for conditional
reinstatement of the driver's license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction.
     (c) A program participant whose driver's license has been revoked, canceled, or denied under
section 169A.52, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (4), (5), or (6), or subdivision 4, paragraph
(a), clause (4), (5), or (6), or section 169A.54, subdivision 1, clause (4), (5), or (6), may apply for a
limited license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction, if the program participant is enrolled in
a licensed chemical dependency treatment or rehabilitation program as recommended in a chemical
use assessment, and if the participant meets the other applicable requirements of section 171.30.
After completing a licensed chemical dependency treatment or rehabilitation program and one year
of limited license use without violating the ignition interlock restriction, the conditions of limited
license use, or program guidelines, the participant may apply for conditional reinstatement of the
driver's license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction. If the program participant's ignition
interlock device subsequently registers a positive breath alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, the

commissioner shall cancel the driver's license, and the program participant may apply for another
limited license according to this paragraph.
    (d) Notwithstanding any statute or rule to the contrary, the commissioner has authority to
determine when a program participant is eligible for restoration of full driving privileges, except
that the commissioner shall not reinstate full driving privileges until the program participant has
met all applicable prerequisites for reinstatement under section 169A.55 and until the program
participant's device has registered no positive breath alcohol concentrations of 0.02 or higher
during the preceding 90 days.
    Subd. 5. Penalties; program violations. (a) If a program participant tampers with, circumvents,
or bypasses a device; drives, operates, or exercises physical control over a motor vehicle not
equipped with a device certified by the commissioner; violates a condition of a limited license
issued under subdivision 4 and section 171.30; or violates the program guidelines of subdivision 2,
the commissioner shall extend the person's revocation period under section 169A.52 or 169A.54
by:
   (1) 180 days for a first violation;
   (2) one year for a second violation; or
   (3) 545 days for a third and each subsequent violation.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the commissioner may terminate participation in the
program by any person when, in the commissioner's judgment, termination is necessary to the
interests of public safety and welfare. In the event of termination, the commissioner shall not
reduce the applicable revocation period under section 169A.52 or 169A.54 by the amount of time
during which the person possessed a limited or restricted driver's license issued under the authority
of subdivision 4.
    Subd. 6. Penalties; tampering. (a) A person who lends, rents, or leases a motor vehicle that is
not equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device certified by the commissioner to a person
with a license issued under this section knowing that the person is subject to the ignition interlock
restriction is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (b) A person who tampers with, circumvents, or bypasses the ignition interlock device, or assists
another to tamper with, circumvent, or bypass the device, is guilty of a misdemeanor except when
the action was taken for emergency purposes or for mechanical repair, and the person limited to the
use of an ignition interlock device does not operate the motor vehicle while the device is disengaged.
    Subd. 7. Venue. In addition to the provisions of Rule 24 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure and
section 627.01, a violation of subdivision 6 or section 171.09, subdivision 1, paragraph (e), may be
prosecuted in:
   (1) the county in which the vehicle involved in the offense is found;
   (2) the county in which the accused resides;
    (3) any county through which the vehicle traveled in the course of the trip during or after which
the offense was committed; or
   (4) the county in which the impaired driving incident occurred, which resulted in the accused

    Subd. 8. Rulemaking. In establishing the performance standards and certification process
of subdivision 2 and the program guidelines of subdivision 3, the commissioner is exempt from
chapter 14, including section 14.386. If rules are otherwise necessary to implement this section, the
commissioner may adopt, amend, and repeal rules using the exempt procedures of section 14.386,
except that paragraph (b) shall not apply.
  EFFECTIVE DATE. Subdivisions 1 to 7 are effective July 1, 2011. Subdivision 8 is effective

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.131, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Certain violations excepted. Subdivision 1 does not apply to a misdemeanor violation
of section 169A.20; 171.09, subdivision 1, paragraph (e); 171.306, subdivision 6; 609.224;
609.2242; 609.226; 609.324, subdivision 3; 609.52; or 617.23, or an ordinance that conforms in

   Sec. 16. RULEMAKING.
    The commissioner may adopt, amend, or repeal rules as needed to administer Minnesota

    Subdivision 1. General rule. Unless specifically provided otherwise in general laws or statutes,
the term "county" when used in Minnesota Statutes or any general legislative act includes home rule
charter counties organized under this chapter. In addition to powers and duties granted or imposed

duties imposed upon it by law. If a charter provision conflicts with a general law, the requirements
of the law prevail.

to incur indebtedness or issue bonds are subject to the charter if the charter provisions are not in
conflict with general laws relating to indebtedness.
