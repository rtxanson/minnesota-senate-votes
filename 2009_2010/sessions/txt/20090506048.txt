   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 611A.0315, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Notice of decision not to prosecute. (a) A prosecutor shall make every
reasonable effort to notify a victim of domestic assault, a criminal sexual conduct offense, or
harassment that the prosecutor has decided to decline prosecution of the case or to dismiss the
criminal charges filed against the defendant. Efforts to notify the victim should include, in order
of priority: (1) contacting the victim or a person designated by the victim by telephone; and (2)

before the suspect is released from custody.
    (b) Whenever a prosecutor dismisses criminal charges against a person accused of domestic
assault, a criminal sexual conduct offense, or harassment, a record shall be made of the specific
reasons for the dismissal. If the dismissal is due to the unavailability of the witness, the prosecutor
shall indicate the specific reason that the witness is unavailable.
    (c) Whenever a prosecutor notifies a victim of domestic assault, criminal sexual conduct, or
harassment under this section, the prosecutor shall also inform the victim of the method and benefits
of seeking an order for protection under section 518B.01 or a restraining order under section 609.748
and that the victim may seek an order without paying a fee.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 2. [611A.203] DOMESTIC FATALITY REVIEW TEAMS.
    Subdivision 1. Domestic fatality review teams; purpose. A judicial district may establish a
domestic fatality review team to review domestic violence deaths that have occurred in the district.
The team may review cases in which prosecution has been completed or the prosecutorial authority
has decided not to pursue the case. The purpose of the review team is to assess domestic violence
deaths in order to develop recommendations for policies and protocols for community prevention
and intervention initiatives to reduce and eliminate the incidence of domestic violence and resulting
fatalities.
    Subd. 2. Definition of domestic violence death. "Domestic violence death" means a homicide
or suicide under any of the following circumstances:
   (1) the alleged perpetrator and victim resided together at any time;
   (2) the alleged perpetrator and victim have a child in common, regardless of whether they were
married or lived together at any time;
   (3) the alleged perpetrator and victim were married, separated, or divorced;
    (4) the alleged perpetrator and victim had a sexual relationship or a significant romantic
relationship;
   (5) the alleged perpetrator had been stalking the victim;
   (6) the homicide victim lived in the same household, was present in the workplace of, was in
proximity of, or was related by blood or affinity to a victim who experienced or was threatened with
domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator;
    (7) the victim or the perpetrator was a child of a person in a relationship that is described within
this definition; or
   (8) any other circumstances that the domestic fatality review team decides fall within the
parameters of its mission.
    "Domestic violence death" must be interpreted broadly to give the domestic fatality review
team discretion to review fatalities that have occurred both directly and peripherally to domestic
relationships.

    Subd. 3. Membership. (a) The chief judge, in consultation with the family violence coordinating
council, shall appoint the members of the domestic fatality review team. Membership must reflect
a commitment to diversity and relevant professional experience. The review team members must
include:
   (1) the medical examiner;
   (2) a judicial court officer (judge or referee);
   (3) a county and city attorney and a public defender;
   (4) the county sheriff and a peace officer;
   (5) a representative from family court services and the Department of Corrections;
   (6) a physician familiar with domestic violence issues;
   (7) a representative from district court administration and the domestic abuse service center;
   (8) a public citizen representative or a representative from a civic organization;
   (9) a mental health professional; and
   (10) domestic violence advocates or shelter workers.
    (b) There must be at least three domestic violence advocates or shelter workers on the domestic
fatality review team. No two members may represent the same agency. Members representing
advocates or shelters must be selected by the advocacy community. At least one position must
be designated for a minority representative and one position must rotate in order to include an
advocate from the community in which the fatality under review took place.
   (c) The domestic fatality review team may also invite other relevant persons to serve on an ad
hoc basis and participate as full members of the review team for a particular review. These persons
may include, but are not limited to:
   (1) individuals with particular expertise that would be helpful to the review panel; or
    (2) representatives of organizations or agencies that had contact with or provided services to
the homicide victim, or to the alleged perpetrator, a victim who experienced or was threatened with
domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator, or a family member of one of those individuals.
    Subd. 4. Duties; access to data. (a) The domestic fatality review team shall collect, review, and
analyze death certificates and death data, including investigative reports, medical and counseling
records, victim service records, employment records, child abuse reports, or other information
concerning domestic violence deaths, survivor interviews and surveys, and other information
deemed by the team as necessary and appropriate concerning the causes and manner of domestic
violence deaths.
    (b) The review team has access to the following not public data, as defined in section 13.02,
subdivision 8a, relating to a case being reviewed by the team: inactive law enforcement investigative
data under section 13.82; autopsy records and coroner or medical examiner investigative data under

48TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 6, 2009                                         4061

the alleged perpetrator, or another victim who experienced or was threatened with domestic abuse
by the perpetrator; and child maltreatment records under section 626.556, relating to the victim or
a family or household member of the victim. Access to medical records under this paragraph also
includes records governed by sections 144.291 to 144.298.
   (c) As part of any review, the domestic fatality review team may compel the production of other
records by applying to the district court for a subpoena, which will be effective throughout the state
according to the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    Subd. 5. Confidentiality; data privacy. A person attending a domestic fatality review team
meeting may not disclose what transpired at the meeting, except to carry out the purposes of the
review team or as otherwise provided in this subdivision. The review team may disclose the names of
the victims in the cases it reviewed. The proceedings and records of the review team are confidential
data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 3, or protected nonpublic data as defined in section
13.02, subdivision 13, regardless of their classification in the hands of the person who provided
the data, and are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil or criminal action
against a professional, the state or a county agency, arising out of the matters the team is reviewing.
Information, documents, and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from
discovery or use in a civil or criminal action solely because they were presented during proceedings
of the review team. This section does not limit a person who presented information before the review
team or who is a member of the panel from testifying about matters within the person's knowledge.
However, in a civil or criminal proceeding, a person may not be questioned about the person's good
faith presentation of information to the review team or opinions formed by the person as a result of
the review team meetings.
    Subd. 6. Immunity. Members of the domestic fatality advisory board, members of the domestic
fatality review team, and members of each review panel, as well as their agents or employees, are
immune from claims and are not subject to any suits, liability, damages, or any other recourse, civil
or criminal, arising from any act, proceeding, decision, or determination undertaken or performed or
recommendation made by the domestic fatality review team, provided they acted in good faith and
without malice in carrying out their responsibilities. Good faith is presumed until proven otherwise
and the complainant has the burden of proving malice or a lack of good faith. No organization,
institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports, or records to the domestic
fatality review team as part of an investigation is civilly or criminally liable or subject to any other
recourse for providing the information.
    Subd. 7. Evaluation and report. (a) Each domestic fatality review team shall develop a system
for evaluating the effectiveness of its program and shall focus on identifiable goals and outcomes. An
evaluation must include data components as well as input from individuals involved in the review
process.
    (b) Each fatality review team shall issue an annual report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the senate and house committees with jurisdiction over public safety issues. The report
must consist of the written aggregate recommendations of the domestic fatality review team without
reference to specific cases. The report must be available upon request and distributed to the governor,
attorney general, supreme court, county board, and district court.

    Sec. 4. LICENSE REINSTATEMENT DIVERSION PILOT PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. An eligible city may establish a license reinstatement diversion
pilot program for holders of class D drivers' licenses who have been charged with violating
Minnesota Statutes, section 171.24, subdivision 1 or 2, but have not yet entered a plea in the
proceedings. An individual charged with driving after revocation under Minnesota Statutes,
section 171.24, subdivision 2, is eligible for diversion only if the revocation was due to a violation
of Minnesota Statutes, section 169.791; 169.797; 169A.52; 169A.54; or 171.17, subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), clause (6). An individual who is a holder of a commercial driver's license or who has
committed an offense in a commercial motor vehicle is ineligible for participation in the diversion
pilot program.
     Subd. 2. Eligible cities. Each of the cities of Duluth, St. Paul, South St. Paul, West St. Paul, and
Inver Grove Heights is eligible to establish the license reinstatement diversion pilot program within
its city. The commissioner of public safety may permit other cities to establish license reinstatement
diversion pilot programs within their cities.

   Subd. 3. Contract. Notwithstanding any law or ordinance to the contrary, an eligible city may
contract with a third party to create and administer the diversion program.
    Subd. 4. Diversion of individual. A prosecutor for a participating city may determine whether
to accept an individual for diversion, and in doing so shall consider:
    (1) whether the individual has a record of driving without a valid license or other criminal record,
or has previously participated in a diversion program;
   (2) the strength of the evidence against the individual, along with any mitigating factors; and
   (3) the apparent ability and willingness of the individual to participate in the diversion program
and comply with its requirements.
    Subd. 5. Diversion driver's license. (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the
commissioner of public safety may issue a diversion driver's license to a person who is a participant
in a pilot program for diversion, following receipt of an application and payment of:
    (1) the reinstatement fee under Minnesota Statutes, section 171.20, subdivision 4, by a
participant whose driver's license has been suspended;
    (2) the reinstatement fee under Minnesota Statutes, section 171.29, subdivision 2, paragraph (a),
by a participant whose driver's license has been revoked under Minnesota Statutes, section 169.791;
169.797; or 171.17, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (6); or
    (3) the reinstatement fee under Minnesota Statutes, section 171.29, subdivision 2, paragraph (a),
by a participant whose driver's license has been revoked under Minnesota Statutes, section 169A.52
or 169A.54. The reinstatement fee and surcharge, both of which are provided under Minnesota
Statutes, section 171.29, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), also must be paid during the course of, and
as a condition of, the diversion program.
The diversion driver's license may bear restrictions imposed by the commissioner suitable to the
licensee's driving ability or other restrictions applicable to the licensee as the commissioner may
determine to be appropriate to assure the safe operation of a motor vehicle by the licensee.
    (b) Payments by participants in the diversion program of the reinstatement fee and surcharge
under Minnesota Statutes, section 171.29, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), must be applied first toward
payment of the reinstatement fee, and after the reinstatement fee has been fully paid, toward payment
of the surcharge. Each payment that is applied toward the reinstatement fee must be credited as
provided in Minnesota Statutes, section 171.29, subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and each payment
that is applied toward the surcharge must be credited as provided in Minnesota Statutes, section
171.29, subdivision 2, paragraphs (c) and (d).
    Subd. 6. Components of program. (a) At a minimum, the diversion program must require
individuals to:
   (1) successfully attend and complete, at the individual's expense, educational classes that
provide, among other things, information on drivers' licensure;
    (2) pay, according to a schedule approved by the prosecutor, all required fees, fines, and charges,
including applicable statutory license reinstatement fees and costs of participation in the program;

   (3) comply with all traffic laws; and
   (4) demonstrate compliance with vehicle insurance requirements.
    (b) An individual who is accepted into the pilot program is eligible to apply for a diversion
driver's license.
    Subd. 7. Termination of participation in diversion program. (a) An individual's participation
in the diversion program may terminate when:
    (1) during participation in the program, the individual is guilty of a moving traffic violation or
failure to provide vehicle insurance;
   (2) the third-party administrator of the diversion program informs the court and the
commissioner of public safety that the individual is no longer satisfying the conditions of the
diversion; or
   (3) the third-party administrator informs the court, the prosecutor, and the commissioner of
public safety that the individual has met all conditions of the diversion program, including, at a
minimum, satisfactory fulfillment of the components in subdivision 6, whereupon the court shall
dismiss the charge or the prosecutor shall decline to prosecute.
   (b) Upon termination of an individual's participation in the diversion program, the commissioner
shall cancel the individual's diversion driver's license.
   (c) The original charge against the individual of violation of Minnesota Statutes, section 171.24,
may be reinstated against an individual whose participation in the diversion program terminates
under paragraph (a), clause (1) or (2).
    (d) The commissioner shall reinstate the driver's license of an individual whose participation in
the diversion program terminates under paragraph (a), clause (3).
    Subd. 8. Report. (a) By February 1, 2011, the commissioner of public safety and each eligible
city that participates in the diversion program shall report to the legislative committees with
jurisdiction over transportation and the judiciary concerning the results of the program. The report
must be made electronically and available in print only upon request. The report must include,
without limitation, the effect of the program on:
   (1) recidivism rates for participants in the diversion pilot program;
    (2) the number of unlicensed drivers who continue to drive in violation of Minnesota Statutes,
section 171.24;
    (3) payment of the fees and fines collected in the diversion pilot program to cities, counties, and
the state;
   (4) educational support provided to participants in the diversion pilot program; and
  (5) the total number of participants in the diversion pilot program and the number of participants
who have terminated from the pilot program under subdivision 7, paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3).

methamphetamine precursor drug or a combination of methamphetamine precursor drugs or any

   (d) Over-the-counter sales of methamphetamine precursor drugs are limited to:
   (1) packages containing not more than a total of three grams of one or more methamphetamine
precursor drugs, calculated in terms of ephedrine base or pseudoephedrine base; or
   (2) for nonliquid products, sales in blister packs, where each blister contains not more than two
dosage units, or, if the use of blister packs is not technically feasible, sales in unit dose packets or
pouches.
    (e) A business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine precursor drugs in an
over-the-counter sale shall ensure that all packages of the drugs are displayed behind a checkout
counter where the public is not permitted and are offered for sale only by a licensed pharmacist,
a registered pharmacy technician, or a pharmacy clerk. The establishment shall ensure that the
person making the sale requires the buyer:
   (1) to provide photographic identification showing the buyer's date of birth; and

faith relied on proof of age as described in section 340A.503, subdivision 6.
   (h) A person who knowingly violates paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is guilty of a misdemeanor

more than $1,000, or both.
    (i) An owner, operator, supervisor, or manager of a business establishment that offers for sale
methamphetamine precursor drugs whose employee or agent is convicted of or charged with
violating paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) is not subject to the criminal penalties for violating any
of those paragraphs if the person:
    (1) did not have prior knowledge of, participate in, or direct the employee or agent to commit
the violation; and
   (2) documents that an employee training program was in place to provide the employee or
agent with information on the state and federal laws and regulations regarding methamphetamine
precursor drugs.

    (j) Any person employed by a business establishment that offers for sale methamphetamine
precursor drugs who sells such a drug to any person in a suspicious transaction shall report the
transaction to the owner, supervisor, or manager of the establishment. The owner, supervisor, or

   (l) The Board of Pharmacy, in consultation with the Department of Public Safety, shall certify
methamphetamine precursor drugs that meet the requirements of paragraph (k), clause (2), and
publish an annual listing of these drugs.
    (m) Wholesale drug distributors licensed and regulated by the Board of Pharmacy pursuant to

shall similarly control the substance under this chapter, after the expiration of 30 days from
publication in the Federal Register of a final order designating a substance as a controlled substance
or rescheduling or deleting a substance. Such order shall be filed with the secretary of state. If
within that 30-day period, the state Board of Pharmacy objects to inclusion, rescheduling, or
deletion, it shall publish the reasons for objection and afford all interested parties an opportunity to
be heard. At the conclusion of the hearing, the state Board of Pharmacy shall publish its decision,
which shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 14.
    In exercising the authority granted by this chapter, the state Board of Pharmacy shall be subject
to the provisions of chapter 14. The state Board of Pharmacy shall provide copies of any proposed

    Subd. 12a. Joint exercise of police power; employees. If an agreement, merger, or
consolidation authorizes the exercise of peace officer or police powers by an officer appointed

peace officer or public safety dispatcher is considered to have begun employment with the new
entity on the first day of employment by the governmental unit employing the peace officer or
public safety dispatcher immediately preceding the creation of the new entity and must be credited
with all previously accumulated vacation and sick leave time.

statewide systems are classified as private, pursuant to section 13.02, subdivision 12, except that

individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted,
associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement
information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the
offense. If an individual's name or other identifying information is erroneously associated with a
criminal history and a determination is made through a fingerprint verification that the individual is
not the subject of the criminal history, the name or other identifying information must be redacted
from the public criminal history data. The name and other identifying information must be retained
in the criminal history and are classified as private data.

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.03, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Background check required. (a) A school hiring authority shall request a
criminal history background check from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
on all individuals who are offered employment in a school and on all individuals, except enrolled
student volunteers, who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other
extracurricular academic coaching services to a school, regardless of whether any compensation
is paid. In order for an individual to be eligible for employment or to provide the services, the
individual must provide an executed criminal history consent form and a money order or check
payable to either the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension or the school hiring authority, at the
discretion of the school hiring authority, in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension and the school district of conducting the criminal history background
check. A school hiring authority deciding to receive payment may, at its discretion, accept payment
in the form of a negotiable instrument other than a money order or check and shall pay the
superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension directly to conduct the background check.
The superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall conduct the background check

criminal history background check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by
the State Board of Teaching or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an
offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check

that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).

   (6) the opportunity for community-wide mobility and to access public transportation, including
door-to-door assistance and weekend and evening access.
   (c) Communities for a lifetime must demonstrate the availability of supports and services for
senior residents that include, but are not limited to:
   (1) an array of home and community-based services to support seniors' options to remain in an
independent living setting as they age and become more frail;
  (2) access to contemporary remote medical technology for cost-effective home-based
monitoring of medical conditions;
   (3) access to nutrition programs, including congregate meal and home-delivered meal

of the opportunities, services, and supports identified in paragraphs (b) and (c);

by local plans; provisions addressing the availability of the opportunities, supports, and services
identified in paragraphs (b) and (c); and strategies to develop physical infrastructure responsive to
the needs of the projected population.

    (b) All or any portion of tax credits issued under this section may be allocated to one or more
taxpayers who have any ownership interest in the taxpayer that owns the qualified Minnesota
project, without regard to any other allocation of credits, depreciation, profits, or losses under
the entities' organizational documents. Alternatively, all or any portions of the tax credits issued
under this section may be transferred, sold, or assigned to a taxpayer without transferring any
ownership interest in the qualified Minnesota project or any interest in the entity owning the
project. The transfer must include all credits attributable to periods after the transfer date, except
for carryforward of prior year credits.
    (c) An owner of a qualified Minnesota project must certify to the commissioner the amount of

project eligible for the credit shall submit, together with the project owner's tax return under this
chapter, a copy of the eligibility statement issued by the agency with respect to the qualified
Minnesota project. If the owner fails to attach the eligibility statement, a credit is not allowed for
that project for that taxable year until the copy is provided to the commissioner.
    (d) If recapture is required under subdivision 5, any statement submitted to the commissioner as
provided in this subdivision must include the proportion of the state credit required to be recaptured,
the identity of each taxpayer subject to the recapture, and the amount of credit previously allocated
to the taxpayer.
    Subd. 4. Rules. The director of the agency, in consultation with the commissioner, may adopt
rules necessary to administer the provisions of this section.
   Subd. 5. Recapture. If under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of any federal

authorized by this section with respect to the qualified Minnesota project must also be recaptured.

The state recapture amount shall be equal to the amount of the state low-income housing tax credits
previously claimed times a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of recaptured federal
low-income housing tax credits and the denominator of which is the amount of federal low-income
housing tax credits previously claimed.
   Subd. 6. Credit duration. Except for unused credits carried forward under this section, a
taxpayer is not eligible for Minnesota low-income housing tax credits for more than ten taxable
years.
    Subd. 7. Education, promotion, and enhancement. (a) The agency, in cooperation with
the suballocators, shall conduct periodic educational seminars and promotional events to inform
potentially interested purchasers of the state credit and shall facilitate and encourage creation of
state credit buyer pools to acquire federal and state credits in Minnesota.
    (b) The agency, in collaboration with the suballocators, may pursue methods of enhancing the
efficiency of the Minnesota low-income housing tax credit program, including pursuing opinions
from the United States Department of Treasury's Internal Revenue Service in the form of general
counsel memoranda, private letter rulings and other notices, rulings, or guidelines, to enhance the
value of the credits; by reviewing other state low-income housing tax programs that utilize an option
for taxpayers to receive the tax credits in the form of a loan generated by transferring the credit to
a designated state entity; and any other methods.
   (c) Not later than January 15, 2015, the agency shall submit a report to the chairs and
ranking minority members of the taxes committees of the senate and the house of representatives
on the success and efficiency of the Minnesota low-income housing tax credit program and
recommendations for enhancement or modifications of the program.

of the home, or (ii) $6,750. The agency may charge a reasonable fee for the costs associated with
making and servicing tax credit advance loans. The agency shall require the first-time homebuyer
to execute a promissory note secured by a second mortgage on the property being purchased to
secure repayment of the loan as referenced in subdivision 5. The agency may use amounts in the
first-time homebuyer tax credit advance loan account to fund the tax credit advance loan program.
    Subd. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this section, "federal first-time homebuyer credit" means
the credit allowed under section 36 of the Internal Revenue Code, and "first-time homebuyer" has

   "Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.31, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Withholding tax, withholding from payments to out-of-state contractors, and
withholding by partnerships and small business corporations. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), an employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision
2, who fails to pay to or deposit with the commissioner a sum or sums required by those sections
to be deducted, withheld, and paid, is personally and individually liable to the state for the sum
or sums, and added penalties and interest, and is not liable to another person for that payment or
payments. The sum or sums deducted and withheld under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or
290.923, subdivision 2, must be held as a special fund in trust for the state of Minnesota.
    (b) If the employer or person withholding tax under section 290.92 or 290.923, subdivision 2,
fails to deduct and withhold the tax in violation of those sections, and later the taxes against which
the tax may be credited are paid, the tax required to be deducted and withheld will not be collected
from the employer. This does not, however, relieve the employer from liability for any penalties and
interest otherwise applicable for failure to deduct and withhold. This paragraph does not apply to
an employer subject to paragraph (g), or to a contractor required to withhold under section 290.92,
subdivision 31.
    (c) Liability for payment of withholding taxes includes a responsible person or entity described
in the personal liability provisions of section 270C.56.
    (d) Liability for payment of withholding taxes includes a third party lender or surety described
in section 270C.59.
   (e) A partnership or S corporation required to withhold and remit tax under section 290.92,
subdivisions 4b and 4c, is liable for payment of the tax to the commissioner, and a person having
control of or responsibility for the withholding of the tax or the filing of returns due in connection
with the tax is personally liable for the tax due.
    (f) A payor of sums required to be withheld under section 290.9705, subdivision 1, is liable to
the state for the amount required to be deducted, and is not liable to an out-of-state contractor for
the amount of the payment.
   (g) If an employer fails to withhold tax from the wages of an employee when required to do so

under section 290.92, subdivision 2a, by reason of treating such employee as not being an employee,
then the liability for tax is equal to three percent of the wages paid to the employee. The liability for
tax of an employee is not affected by the assessment or collection of tax under this paragraph. The
employer is not entitled to recover from the employee any tax determined under this paragraph.

sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any added

   Subd. 3. Cooperatives and charitable corporations; homestead and other property. (a)
When property is owned by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B,
and each person who owns a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to
occupy a building on the property, or a unit within a building on the property, the corporation or

association may claim homestead treatment for each dwelling, or for each unit in the case of a
building containing several dwelling units, or for the part of the value of the building occupied by a
shareholder. Each building or unit must be designated by legal description or number. The net tax
capacity of each building or unit that qualifies for assessment as a homestead under this subdivision
must include not more than one-half acre of land, if platted, nor more than 80 acres if unplatted.
The net tax capacity of the property is the sum of the net tax capacities of each of the respective
buildings or units comprising the property, including the net tax capacity of each unit's or building's
proportionate share of the land and any common buildings. To qualify for the treatment provided
by this subdivision, the corporation or association must be wholly owned by persons having a right
to occupy a building or unit owned by the corporation or association. A charitable corporation
organized under the laws of Minnesota and not otherwise exempt thereunder with no outstanding
stock qualifies for homestead treatment with respect to member residents of the dwelling units who
have purchased and hold residential participation warrants entitling them to occupy the units.
    (b) To the extent provided in paragraph (a), a cooperative or corporation organized under
chapter 308A or 308B may obtain separate assessment and valuation, and separate property
tax statements for each residential homestead, residential nonhomestead, or for each seasonal
residential recreational building or unit not used for commercial purposes. The appropriate class
rates under section 273.13 shall be applicable as if each building or unit were a separate tax parcel;
provided, however, that the tax parcel which exists at the time the cooperative or corporation
makes application under this subdivision shall be a single parcel for purposes of property taxes or
the enforcement and collection thereof, other than as provided in paragraph (a) or this paragraph.
    (c) A member of a corporation or association may initially obtain the separate assessment and
valuation and separate property tax statements, as provided in paragraph (b), by applying to the
assessor by June 30 of the assessment year.
    (d) When a building, or dwelling units within a building, no longer qualify under paragraph
(a) or (b), the current owner must notify the assessor within 30 days. Failure to notify the assessor
within 30 days shall result in the loss of benefits under paragraph (a) or (b) for taxes payable in the
year that the failure is discovered. For these purposes, "benefits under paragraph (a) or (b)" means
the difference in the net tax capacity of the building or units which no longer qualify as computed
under paragraph (a) or (b) and as computed under the otherwise applicable law, times the local tax
rate applicable to the building for that taxes payable year. Upon discovery of a failure to notify, the
assessor shall inform the auditor of the difference in net tax capacity for the building or buildings
in which units no longer qualify, and the auditor shall calculate the benefits under paragraph (a) or
(b). Such amount, plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of that amount, shall then be demanded of the
building's owner. The property owner may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a
petition for review with county officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing a proof of service
as provided in section 278.01 with the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice
from the county. The appeal shall be governed by the Tax Court procedures provided in chapter 271,
for cases relating to the tax laws as defined in section 271.01, subdivision 5; disregarding sections
273.125, subdivision 5, and 278.03, but including section 278.05, subdivision 2. If the amount of
the benefits under paragraph (a) or (b) and penalty are not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has
been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of the benefit and penalty to the succeeding
year's tax list to be collected as part of the property taxes on the affected property.

    Subd. 3a. Manufactured home park cooperative. When a manufactured home park is owned
by a corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B, and each person who owns
a share or shares in the corporation or association is entitled to occupy a lot within the park, the
corporation or association may claim homestead treatment for each lot occupied by a shareholder.
Each lot must be designated by legal description or number, and each lot is limited to not more than
one-half acre of land for each homestead. The manufactured home park shall be valued and assessed
as if it were homestead property within class 1 if all of the following criteria are met:
     (1) the occupant is using the property as a permanent residence;
    (2) the occupant or the cooperative association is paying the ad valorem property taxes and any
special assessments levied against the land and structure either directly, or indirectly through dues
to the corporation; and
   (3) the corporation or association organized under chapter 308A or 308B is wholly owned by
persons having a right to occupy a lot owned by the corporation or association.
    A charitable corporation, organized under the laws of Minnesota with no outstanding stock,
and granted a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, qualifies for
homestead treatment with respect to member residents of the manufactured home park who hold
residential participation warrants entitling them to occupy a lot in the manufactured home park."

                         ­­p
to classify and manage tax-forfeited lands held by the state in trust for the local units as provided in
section 281.25, the county board has the discretion to decide that some lands in public ownership
should be retained and managed for public benefits while other lands should be returned to private
ownership. Parcels of land becoming the property of the state in trust under law declaring the
forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes must be classified by the county board of the county in
which the parcels lie as conservation or nonconservation. In making the classification the board
shall consider the present use of adjacent lands, the productivity of the soil, the character of forest
or other growth, accessibility of lands to established roads, schools, and other public services, their
peculiar suitability or desirability for particular uses, and the suitability of the forest resources on
the land for multiple use,         ­ and sustained yield management. The classification, furthermore, must:
(1) encourage and foster a mode of land utilization that will facilitate the economical and adequate
provision of transportation, roads, water supply, drainage, sanitation, education, and recreation; (2)
facilitate reduction of governmental expenditures; (3) conserve and develop the natural resources;

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
    (c) Prior to meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided
that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site. The
notice must also be mailed or otherwise delivered to each person who has filed a request for notice
of special meetings with the public body, regardless of whether the matter is considered at a regular
or special meeting. The notice must be mailed or delivered at least 60 days before the date of the
meeting. If the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be mailed or
delivered at least 14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The public body shall publish
the notice once, at least 30 days before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within
the area of the public body's authority. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to
each person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided
in chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this

paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities at the meeting.
    (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent
information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. The county board must solicit and consider any relevant components of
current municipal or metropolitan comprehensive land use plans that incorporate the area in which
the land is located. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay taking
action on any parcel or parcels. In order for a state agency or a governmental subdivision of the
state to preserve its right to request a purchase or other acquisition of a forfeited parcel, it may, at
any time following forfeiture, file a written request to withhold the parcel from sale or lease to others
under the provisions of subdivision 1a.
    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
    (f) A county board may by resolution elect to use the classification and reclassification
procedures provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), instead of the procedures provided in paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d). Once an election is made under this paragraph, it is effective for a minimum of
five years.
    (g) The classification or reclassification of tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released
from the trust may be made by the county board using information made available to it by any
office or department of the federal, state, or local governments, or by any other person or agency
possessing pertinent information at the time the classification is made.
    (h) If the lands are located within the boundaries of an organized town or incorporated
municipality, a classification or reclassification and sale must first be approved by the town board
of the town or the governing body of the municipality in which the lands are located. The town
board of the town or the governing body of the municipality is considered to have approved the
classification or reclassification and sale if the county board is not notified of the disapproval of
the classification or reclassification and sale within 60 days of the date the request for approval
was transmitted to the town board of the town or governing body of the municipality. If the town
board or governing body disapproves of the classification or reclassification and sale, the county
board must follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) and (d), with regard to the parcel, and must
additionally cause to be published in a newspaper a notice of the date, time, location, and purpose
of the required meeting.
    (i) If a town board or a governing body of a municipality desires to acquire any parcel lying in
the town or municipality by procedures authorized in this section, it may file a written request under
subdivision 1a, paragraph (a).

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Conveyance;   ­­
                             ­g­­
                                en­­
                                   e­
                                    ra
                                     ­­l
                                      l­y­ to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state
agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be
withheld from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted
to the county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease
to any other party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding
period to the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision
of the state, the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county
during the period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to
the requesting party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting
party terminates the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property ­o­
                                                                                           r. When
the term "market value" is used in this section, it means an estimate of the full and actual market
value of the parcel as determined by the county board, but in making this determination, the board
and the persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist
in the determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application ­
                         o­f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market, or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.

recommendation of the county board. For the purposes of this paragraph, "authorized public use"
means a use that allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property
in numbers appropriate to its size and use, or is for a public service facility. Authorized public uses
as defined in this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, athletic fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit ways for buses or commuter trains;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water towers, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
    (f) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision of the state by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the
favorable recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the
board that prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement or instrument, but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or
consideration is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that prior to forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed
to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions
attach to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state
for less than its market value for either: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant
limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed
back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall be

refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.

                                                                  t­­ e­­ co­n ­v­­ ey­­an­­c­e­. For the purposes of this paragraph, there is no
failure to put the land to the authorized public use and no abandonment of that use if a formal plan
of the governmental subdivision, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive plan or land use
plan that shows an intended future use of the land for the authorized public use.
    (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue after January 1, 2006, may be acquired by that
governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the conveyance if the commissioner
determines upon written application from the subdivision that the subdivision has in fact put the
property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed, and the subdivision has made a
finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Prior to conveying the property,
the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land is located objects to a
conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without further act by or
obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the commissioner
makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on behalf of the
state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For purposes of this
paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in a formal plan
of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.
    (c) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue before January 1, 2006, is released from the use restriction
and possibility of reversion on January 1, 2021, if the county board records a document describing
the land and citing this paragraph. The county board may authorize the county treasurer to deduct
the amount of the recording fees from future settlements of property taxes to the subdivision.
    (d) All property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed by the commissioner of revenue is released from the use restriction and possibility of
reversion on the later of: (1) January 1, 2015; (2) 40 years after the date the deed was executed; or (3)
upon final resolution of an appeal to district court under subdivision 1e if the appeal was commenced
prior to January 1, 2015. Upon the occurrence of clause (1), (2), or (3), the governmental subdivision
may record a certificate referring to the land, the original conveyance, and to the release under this
paragraph.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonconservation lands; appraisal and sale. (a) All parcels of land classified as
nonconservation, except those which may be reserved, shall be sold as provided, if it is determined,
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie, that it is advisable to do so, having in
mind their accessibility, their proximity to existing public improvements, and the effect of their
sale and occupancy on the public burdens. Any parcels of land proposed to be sold shall be first
appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
    (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall
submit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the first publication of the list of lands to be
offered for sale a list of all lands included on the list which are situated outside of any incorporated
municipality. If, at any time before the opening of the sale, the commissioner notifies the county

sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
       (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until
the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                                   In

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only
(1) a payment of at least ten percent of the purchase price must be made at the time of purchase, and
the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber
or timber products must not be removed from these lands until an amount equal to the appraised
value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid
by the purchaser. If a parcel of land bearing standing timber or timber products is sold at public
auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the

the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is
applicable. Interest on the unpaid contract balance on sales occurring before July 1, 1982, is payable
at the rate applicable to the sale at the time that the sale occurred.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. County sales; notice, purchase price, disposition. The sale must commence at the time
determined by the county board of the county in which the parcels are located. The county auditor
shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are
sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as
provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.

city, or in a town which cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local ordinances
regarding minimum area, shape, frontage or access may be sold by the county auditor pursuant to
this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics

frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists
of an undivided interest in land or land and improvements, the property may also be sold to the
other owners under this subdivision. The sale of land pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject
to any conditions imposed by the county board pursuant to section 282.03. The governing body of
the city or town may recommend to the county board conditions to be imposed on the sale. The
county auditor may restrict the sale to owners of lands adjoining the land to be sold. The county
auditor shall conduct the sale by sealed bid or may select another means of sale. The land shall be

    Before a state deed for tax-forfeited land may be issued, the deed tax must be paid by the
purchaser of tax-forfeited land whether the purchase is the result of a public auction or private
sale or a repurchase of tax-forfeited land. State agencies and local units of government that acquire
tax-forfeited land by purchase or any other means are subject to this section. The deed tax is $1.65 for

   "Section 1. [16A.647] TAX CREDIT AND INTEREST SUBSIDY BONDS.
    Subdivision 1. Authority to issue. When authorized by law to issue state general obligation
bonds, the commissioner may issue all or part of the bonds as tax credit bonds or as interest subsidy
bonds or a combination of the two. The provisions of section 16A.695 do not apply to bonds issued
as tax credit bonds or interest subsidy bonds.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given them.
    (b) "Tax credit bonds" means bonds, the interest on which is includable in the income of the
owner of the bonds for federal income tax purposes, but for which the owner is entitled to a federal
tax credit.
    (c) "Interest subsidy bonds" means bonds, the interest on which is includable in the income of
the owner of the bonds for federal income tax purposes, but for which the issuer is entitled to federal
interest subsidy payments based on a percentage of the interest payable on the interest subsidy bonds.
    Subd. 3. Method of sale. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16A.641, subdivision 4,
the commissioner may sell any series of tax credit bonds or interest subsidy bonds at negotiated

sale upon the terms and conditions and the restrictions the commissioner prescribes, but the
commissioner may contract for investment banking and banking services only after receiving
competitive proposals for the services. The commissioner may enter into all contracts deemed
necessary or desirable to accomplish the sale in a cost-effective manner.
    Subd. 4. Sinking fund. The commissioner's order authorizing the issuance of interest subsidy
bonds must establish a separate sinking fund account for the interest subsidy bonds in the state bond
fund. There is annually appropriated, as received, to each interest subsidy bond account, in addition
to amounts appropriated under section 16A.641, the interest subsidy payments received from the
federal government with respect to that issue of interest subsidy bonds in that year.
    Subd. 5. Sale. Tax credit bonds and interest subsidy bonds must be sold at a price not less than
98 percent of their stated principal amount. No state trunk highway bond may be sold for a price of
less than par and accrued interest.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 37.31, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Expiration. The authority to issue bonds, other than bonds to refund outstanding bonds,

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.55, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Pledge of district's full faith and credit. If, at the request of a school district or
intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on a district's
debt obligation on a specific date, the pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers
of the school district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay the principal and
interest due on those debt obligations shall also, without an election or the requirement of a further
authorization, become a pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers of the school
district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay to the state the amount paid,
with interest. Amounts paid by the state must be repaid in the order in which the state payments
were made. Whenever the state pays under this section interest on bonds for which the issuer is
entitled to federal interest subsidy payments, the state is subrogated to the issuer's rights to any
federal interest subsidy payments relating to the interest paid by the state, unless and until the state
has been reimbursed by the issuer in full.

    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.034, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. General obligation revenue bonds. (a) An authority may pledge the general obligation
of the general jurisdiction governmental unit as additional security for bonds payable from income
or revenues of the project or the authority. The authority must find that the pledged revenues will
equal or exceed 110 percent of the principal and interest due on the bonds for each year. The proceeds
of the bonds must be used for a qualified housing development project or projects. The obligations
must be issued and sold in the manner and following the procedures provided by chapter 475, except
the obligations are not subject to approval by the electors, and the maturities may extend to not more
than 35 years for obligations sold to finance housing for the elderly and 40 years for other obligations
issued under this subdivision. The authority is the municipality for purposes of chapter 475.
    (b) The principal amount of the issue must be approved by the governing body of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged. Public hearings must be held on
issuance of the obligations by both the authority and the general jurisdiction governmental unit. The
hearings must be held at least 15 days, but not more than 120 days, before the sale of the obligations.
    (c) The maximum amount of general obligation bonds that may be issued and outstanding under
this section equals the greater of (1) one-half of one percent of the taxable market value of the general
jurisdiction governmental unit whose general obligation is pledged, or (2) $3,000,000. In the case
of county or multicounty general obligation bonds, the outstanding general obligation bonds of all
cities in the county or counties issued under this subdivision must be added in calculating the limit
under clause (1).
    (d) "General jurisdiction governmental unit" means the city in which the housing development
project is located. In the case of a county or multicounty authority, the county or counties may act
as the general jurisdiction governmental unit. In the case of a multicounty authority, the pledge of
the general obligation is a pledge of a tax on the taxable property in each of the counties.
    (e) "Qualified housing development project" means a housing development project providing
housing either for the elderly or for individuals and families with incomes not greater than 80 percent
of the median family income as estimated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development for the standard metropolitan statistical area or the nonmetropolitan county in which
the project is located. The project must be owned for the term of the bonds either by the authority

or by a limited partnership or other entity in which the authority or another entity under the sole
control of the authority is the sole general partner and the partnership or other entity must receive
(1) an allocation from the Department of Finance or an entitlement issuer of tax-exempt bonding
authority for the project and a preliminary determination by the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency
or the applicable suballocator of tax credits that the project will qualify for four percent low-income
housing tax credits or (2) a reservation of nine percent low-income housing tax credits from the
Minnesota Housing Finance Agency or a suballocator of tax credits for the project. A qualified
housing development project may admit nonelderly individuals and families with higher incomes
if:
   (1) three years have passed since initial occupancy;
    (2) the authority finds the project is experiencing unanticipated vacancies resulting in insufficient
revenues, because of changes in population or other unforeseen circumstances that occurred after
the initial finding of adequate revenues; and
    (3) the authority finds a tax levy or payment from general assets of the general jurisdiction
governmental unit will be necessary to pay debt service on the bonds if higher income individuals
or families are not admitted.
    (f) The authority may issue bonds to refund bonds issued under this subdivision in accordance
with section 475.67. The finding of the adequacy of pledged revenues required by paragraph (a) and
the public hearing required by paragraph (b) shall not apply to the issuance of refunding bonds. This
paragraph applies to refunding bonds issued on and after July 1, 1992.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.040, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Leased property, exception. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1, any
property other than property to be operated as a parking facility that the authority leases to private
individuals or corporations for development in connection with a redevelopment project shall have
the same tax status as if the leased property were owned by the private individuals or corporations.
This subdivision does not apply to leases by the authority to individuals or families for residential
use.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section applies to housing projects and housing development
projects constructed or acquired by an authority after July 1, 1987, for property taxes payable in
2010 and thereafter.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.040, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
