within three years after the date of death provided that the action must be commenced within six
years after the act or omission. The recovery in the action is the amount the jury deems fair and just
in reference to the pecuniary loss resulting from the death, and shall be for the exclusive benefit of
the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and next of kin, proportionate to the pecuniary
loss severally suffered by the death. The court then determines the proportionate pecuniary loss of
the persons entitled to the recovery and orders distribution accordingly. Funeral expenses and any
demand for the support of the decedent allowed by the court having jurisdiction of the action, are
first deducted and paid. Punitive damages may be awarded as provided in section 549.20.
    (b) If an action for the injury was commenced by the decedent and not finally determined while
living, it may be continued by the trustee for recovery of damages for the exclusive benefit of the
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner and next of kin, proportionate to the pecuniary loss
severally suffered by the death. The court on motion shall make an order allowing the continuance
and directing pleadings to be made and issues framed as in actions begun under this section.

action and files a bond in an amount determined by the court, but not to exceed $50,000, conditioned
that the owner will immediately abate the nuisance for a period of one year, the court may, if satisfied
of the owner's good faith, order the release of the building or portion of it which is subject to the
order of abatement. If the building or portion of it that is subject to the order of abatement is a
hotel, motel, or similar establishment that rents overnight lodging to the public and the nuisance
was prostitution or prostitution-related activity that involved sex trafficking, as defined in section
609.321, subdivision 7a, the release must require the owner to post a notice in the form specified in
section 340A.5055 in each unit and portion of the building that was subject to the order of abatement.
If the premises are released, for each day during the term of the bond that the owner knowingly
permits any part of the premises to be used for any activity which was the basis of the abatement
order or fails to post the notice, if required, the owner shall forfeit $1,000 under the bond. Forfeiture
under the bond does not relieve the owner from prosecution for contempt. Release of the property

federal offices; state legislative offices; constitutional offices; proposed constitutional amendments;
county offices and questions; municipal offices and questions; school district offices and questions;
special district offices and questions; and judicial offices.
  On optical scan ballots, the names of candidates and the words "yes" and "no" for ballot questions
must be printed as close to their corresponding vote targets as possible.
   The line on an optical scan ballot for write-in votes must contain the words "write-in, if any."
    If a primary ballot contains both a partisan ballot and a nonpartisan ballot, the instructions
to voters must include a statement that reads substantially as follows: "THIS BALLOT CARD
CONTAINS A PARTISAN BALLOT AND A NONPARTISAN BALLOT. ON THE PARTISAN
BALLOT YOU ARE PERMITTED TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES OF ONE POLITICAL
PARTY ONLY." If a primary ballot contains political party columns on both sides of the ballot, the
instructions to voters must include a statement that reads substantially as follows: "ADDITIONAL
POLITICAL PARTIES ARE PRINTED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS BALLOT. VOTE FOR
ONE POLITICAL PARTY ONLY." At the bottom of each political party column on the primary
ballot, the ballot must contain a statement that reads substantially as follows: "CONTINUE
VOTING ON THE NONPARTISAN BALLOT." The instructions in section 204D.08, subdivision
4, do not apply to optical scan partisan primary ballots. Electronic ballot displays and audio ballot
readers must follow the order of offices and questions on the optical scan or paper ballot used in
the same precinct, or the sample ballot posted for that precinct."
