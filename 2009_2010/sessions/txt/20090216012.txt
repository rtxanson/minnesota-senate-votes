Statutes, chapter 62R.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [62R.09] ANTITRUST IMMUNITY.
    Subdivision 1. Intent; purpose. The legislature finds that the goals of controlling health care
costs and improving the quality of and access to health care services in rural areas are significantly
enhanced by the development of health care cooperatives created under this chapter. To promote
health care cooperative arrangements, it is necessary for the cooperatives to collectively negotiate
on behalf of their members. Although negotiations may raise competitive issues, the legislature
finds that properly supervised health care cooperative negotiations will enhance the delivery of
health care in rural markets. The legislature further finds that by establishing a system of review
and supervision of health care cooperative contractual negotiations competition is preserved. The
purpose of this legislation is to clarify the provisions in this chapter to ensure that health care
cooperative arrangements under section 62R.06 are not in violation of state or federal antitrust law.
   Subd. 2. Review and approval; monitoring. (a) The commissioner shall review and authorize
contracts and business or financial arrangements under section 62R.06, subdivision 1. All contracts
and business or financial arrangements must be submitted on an application for approval to the
commissioner.
    (b) Within 30 days after receiving an application, the commissioner may request additional
information that is necessary to complete the review required under this section. If the commissioner
does not request additional information and does not act within 60 days after receipt of an
application, the application shall be deemed approved. If the commissioner requests additional
information and does not act within 60 days of receiving additional information sufficient to
evaluate the application, as determined by the commissioner, the application shall be deemed
approved. The commissioner shall not deny any application unless the commissioner determines,
using the criteria in paragraph (g), that: (1) the anticompetitive effects of the arrangement on
the marketplace exceed the procompetitive effects or efficiencies, or that any price agreements
included in the arrangement are not necessary to achieve the efficiencies that are expected to result
from the arrangement; or (2) the applicant has not provided complete or sufficient information
requested by the commissioner to evaluate the impact of the proposed arrangement on the health

care marketplace.
    (c) The commissioner may collect information from other parties, such as health plan companies
or other health care providers operating in the same geographic area as the health care cooperative,
to assist in evaluating the impact of the proposed arrangement on the health care marketplace. Data
collected from health plan companies and health care providers under this paragraph are nonpublic
data or private data on individuals, as defined in section 13.02.
   (d) The commissioner may solicit public comment on the impact of the proposed arrangement.
    (e) The commissioner may condition approval of a proposed arrangement on a modification
of all or part of the arrangement to eliminate any restriction on competition that is not reasonably
related to the goals of improving health care access or quality. The commissioner may also establish
conditions for approval that are reasonably necessary to protect against abuses of private economic
power and to ensure that the arrangement has oversight by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall monitor arrangements approved under this section to ensure that the
arrangement remains in compliance with the conditions of approval. The commissioner may revoke
an approval upon a finding that the arrangement is not in substantial compliance with the terms of
the application or the conditions of approval.
   (g) In evaluating applications received under this section, the commissioner shall consider
whether:
   (1) the arrangement is likely to produce significant efficiencies that benefit consumers, such as
cost savings or improvements in quality of or access to care;
   (2) the arrangement is likely to have any anticompetitive effects on the marketplace; and
    (3) the potential anticompetitive effects outweigh the procompetitive efficiencies resulting from
the arrangement.
   Subd. 3. Applications. (a) Applications for approval under this section must include a detailed
description of the proposed arrangement.
   (b) The application must include:
   (1) the identities of all the parties to the arrangement;
    (2) the participation rules for the cooperative, including the terms and conditions under which
participating providers may be members of the cooperative;
   (3) a description of the geographic areas served by the cooperative and the products provided,
and a list of competing providers that are not members of the cooperative;
   (4) a description of any restriction on participating members of the cooperative entering into
other contracts with payers; and
   (5) a description of the increased efficiency, improved health care access, improved health care
quality, or increased market competition that will result from the arrangement.
    (c) Data on providers collected under this section are private data on individuals or nonpublic
data, as defined in section 13.02.

    Subd. 4. Application fee. When submitting an application to the commissioner, a health care
cooperative shall pay a fee of $2,000 for the commissioner's cost of reviewing and monitoring the
arrangement. Revenue received by the commissioner under this section shall be appropriated to the
commissioner for the purpose of administering this section."
   Amend the title accordingly
   And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Commerce and
Consumer Protection. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.
