bridge projects within a higher tier must to the extent feasible be selected and funded in the approved
state transportation improvement program, at any stage in the project development process, solicited
for bids, in contract negotiation, under construction, or completed.
    (b) The classification of each tier is as follows:
    (1) tier 1 consists of any bridge in the program that (i) has an average daily traffic count
that is above 1,000 and has a sufficiency rating that is at or below 50, or (ii) is identified by the
commissioner as a priority project;

contract for repair or replacement with a new bridge that contains a load-path-redundant design,
except that a specific bridge may remain in continued service if the reasons are documented in the
report required under subdivision 5.
   (d) All bridge projects funded under this section in fiscal year 2010 or later must include bicycle
and pedestrian accommodations if both sides of the bridge are located in a city or the bridge links a
pedestrian way, shared-use path, trail, or scenic bikeway.
Bicycle and pedestrian accommodations would not be required if:

   (1) a comprehensive assessment demonstrates that there is an absence of need for bicycle and
pedestrian accommodations for the life of the bridge; or
    (2) there is a reasonable alternative bicycle and pedestrian crossing within one-quarter mile of
the bridge project.
All bicycle and pedestrian accommodations should provide for the connection to any existing
bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in close proximity to the bridge. All pedestrian facilities must
meet or exceed federal accessibility requirements as outlined in Title II of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, codified in United States Code, title 42, chapter 126, subchapter II, and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified in United States Code, title 29, section 794.

bridge performance targets, including safety targets for pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorist safety
and compliance with the accessibility requirements of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
Act;
    (3) a summary of bridge projects (i) completed in the previous six years or since the last update
to the Minnesota statewide transportation plan, and (ii) currently in progress under the program;

or home rule charter city as the public interest and convenience may require, if the auditor for the
county in which the city is situated chooses not to accept appointment as the deputy registrar for the
county or is discontinued as a deputy registrar, or if the county in which the city is situated has not
established a county license bureau that issues motor vehicle licenses as provided in section 373.32.
The individual appointed by the commissioner as a deputy registrar for any statutory or home rule
charter city must be a resident of the county in which the city is situated.

as a deputy registrar.
    (d) Despite any other provision, a person other than a county auditor or a director of a county
license bureau, who was appointed by the registrar before August 1, 1976, as a deputy registrar
for any statutory or home rule charter city, may continue to serve as deputy registrar and may be
discontinued for cause only by the commissioner. The county auditor who appointed the deputy
registrars is responsible for the acts of deputy registrars appointed by the auditor.
    (e) Each deputy, before entering upon the discharge of duties, shall take and subscribe an oath
to faithfully discharge the duties and to uphold the laws of the state.
    (f) If a deputy registrar appointed under this subdivision is not an officer or employee of a county

there is filed with the commission a schedule modifying or resulting in a change in any rates then
in force as provided in subdivision 1, the commission may suspend the operation of the schedule
by filing with the schedule of rates and delivering to the affected utility a statement in writing of
its reasons for the suspension at any time before the rates become effective. The suspension shall
not be for a longer period than ten months beyond the initial filing date except as provided in this
subdivision or subdivision 1a.
    (b) During the suspension the commission shall determine whether all questions of the
reasonableness of the rates requested raised by persons deemed interested or by the department can
be resolved to the satisfaction of the commission. If the commission finds that all significant issues
raised have not been resolved to its satisfaction, or upon petition by ten percent of the affected
customers or 250 affected customers, whichever is less, it shall refer the matter to the Office of
Administrative Hearings with instructions for a public hearing as a contested case pursuant to
chapter 14, except as otherwise provided in this section.
    (c) The commission may order that the issues presented by the proposed rate changes be
bifurcated into two separate hearings as follows: (1) determination of the utility's revenue
requirements and (2) determination of the rate design. Upon issuance of both administrative law
judge reports, the issues shall again be joined for consideration and final determination by the
commission.
   (d) All prehearing discovery activities of state agency intervenors shall be consolidated and
conducted by the Department of Commerce.
    (e) If the commission does not make a final determination concerning a schedule of rates within
ten months after the initial filing date, the schedule shall be deemed to have been approved by the
commission; except if:
    (1) an extension of the procedural schedule has been granted under paragraph (f) or subdivision
1a, in which case the schedule of rates is deemed to have been approved by the commission on the
last day of the extended period of suspension; or
    (2) a settlement has been submitted to and rejected by the commission and the commission does
not make a final determination concerning the schedule of rates, the schedule of rates is deemed to

extension of the suspension period under this paragraph does not alter the setting of interim rates
under subdivision 3.
     (g) For the purposes of this section, "final determination" means the initial decision of the
commission and not any order which may be entered by the commission in response to a petition
for rehearing or other further relief. The commission may further suspend rates until it determines
all those petitions.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, subdivision 6c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6c. Incentive plan for energy conservation improvement. (a) The commission may
order public utilities to develop and submit for commission approval incentive plans that describe the
method of recovery and accounting for utility conservation expenditures and savings. In developing
the incentive plans the commission shall ensure the effective involvement of interested parties.
    (b) In approving incentive plans, the commission shall consider:
    (1) whether the plan is likely to increase utility investment in cost-effective energy conservation;
    (2) whether the plan is compatible with the interest of utility ratepayers and other interested
parties;
   (3) whether the plan links the incentive to the utility's performance in achieving cost-effective
conservation; and
    (4) whether the plan is in conflict with other provisions of this chapter.
    (c) The commission may set rates to encourage the vigorous and effective implementation of
utility conservation programs. The commission may:
    (1) increase or decrease any otherwise allowed rate of return on net investment based upon the
utility's skill, efforts, and success in conserving energy;
   (2) share between ratepayers and utilities the net savings resulting from energy conservation
programs to the extent justified by the utility's skill, efforts, and success in conserving energy; and

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, subdivision 7b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7b. Transmission cost adjustment. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, the commission may approve a tariff mechanism for the automatic annual adjustment
of charges for the Minnesota jurisdictional costs of (i) new transmission facilities that have

been separately filed and reviewed and approved by the commission under section 216B.243 or
are certified as a priority project or deemed to be a priority transmission project under section
216B.2425; and (ii) charges incurred by a utility that accrue from other transmission owners'
regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the Midwest Independent
System Operator to benefit the utility, as provided for under a federally approved tariff.
  (b) Upon filing by a public utility or utilities providing transmission service, the commission
may approve, reject, or modify, after notice and comment, a tariff that:
   (1) allows the utility to recover on a timely basis the costs net of revenues of facilities approved
under section 216B.243 or certified or deemed to be certified under section 216B.2425 or exempt
from the requirements of section 216B.243;
    (2) allows the charges incurred by a utility that accrue from other transmission owners'
regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the Midwest Independent
System Operator to benefit the utility, as provided for under a federally approved tariff. These
charges must be reduced or offset by revenues received by the utility and by amounts the utility
charges to other regional transmission owners, to the extent those revenues and charges have not
been otherwise offset;
   (3) allows a return on investment at the level approved in the utility's last general rate case,
unless a different return is found to be consistent with the public interest;
    (4) provides a current return on construction work in progress, provided that recovery from
Minnesota retail customers for the allowance for funds used during construction is not sought
through any other mechanism;
   (5) allows for recovery of other expenses if shown to promote a least-cost project option or is
otherwise in the public interest;
      (6) allocates project costs appropriately between wholesale and retail customers;
    (7) provides a mechanism for recovery above cost, if necessary to improve the overall economics
of the project or projects or is otherwise in the public interest; and
    (8) terminates recovery once costs have been fully recovered or have otherwise been reflected
in the utility's general rates.
    (c) A public utility may file annual rate adjustments to be applied to customer bills paid under
the tariff approved in paragraph (b). In its filing, the public utility shall provide:
      (1) a description of and context for the facilities included for recovery;
      (2) a schedule for implementation of applicable projects;
      (3) the utility's costs for these projects;
      (4) a description of the utility's efforts to ensure the lowest costs to ratepayers for the project;
and
    (5) calculations to establish that the rate adjustment is consistent with the terms of the tariff
established in paragraph (b).

    (d) Upon receiving a filing for a rate adjustment pursuant to the tariff established in paragraph (b),
the commission shall approve the annual rate adjustments provided that, after notice and comment,
the costs included for recovery through the tariff were or are expected to be prudently incurred and
achieve transmission system improvements at the lowest feasible and prudent cost to ratepayers.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7d. Central Corridor utility zone cost adjustment. (a) The Central Corridor utility zone
is the area extending from the Union Depot Station in St. Paul to the proposed multimodal station
in Minneapolis along the route of the light rail transit project connecting those two points, and an
area extending approximately one-quarter mile from that route and including the entire University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis campus.
    (b) A public utility that provides retail electric service within the Central Corridor utility
zone and that is required to replace, relocate, construct, or install new facilities, may apply to the
commission for approval of new facilities in the Central Corridor utility zone and facilities outside
the zone that the utility demonstrates must be changed as a direct result of changes within the zone.
Facilities proposed under this subdivision may include transmission facilities, distribution facilities,
generation facilities, advanced technology-assisted efficiency devices, and energy storage facilities
not otherwise subject to section 216B.243, or chapter 216E, 216F, or 216G. Upon approval under
paragraph (c), the utility may construct and install the facilities.
   (c) The commission may approve the construction and installation of facilities in the Central
Corridor mass transit utility zone proposed by a utility under paragraph (b) upon a finding:
   (1) that the facilities:
   (i) are necessary to provide electric service;
    (ii) assist future development of renewable energy, conservation, electric vehicles, and advanced
technology-assisted efficiency programs and devices; or
   (iii) are exploratory, experimental, or research facilities to advance the use of renewable energy,
conservation, electric vehicles, and advanced technology-assisted efficiency programs and devices;
   (2) that the utility has engaged in a cooperative process with affected local and state government
agencies in the design, planning, or construction of the Central Corridor utility zone project and
changes to utility facilities;
    (3) that the utility and local units of government have made reasonable efforts to seek federal,
state, or private funds that may be available to mass transit and energy projects; and
   (4) that the utility has made reasonable efforts to minimize the project costs and maximize the
value of the facilities to customers.
    (d) Upon request of the commission, the utility shall submit periodic reports to the commission
reviewing the cost and benefits of the facilities constructed within the Central Corridor utility zone
and their potential applicability to other areas outside the Central Corridor utility zone.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.1645, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2a. Cost recovery for utility's renewable facilities. (a) A utility may petition the

commission to approve a rate schedule that provides for the automatic adjustment of charges to
recover prudently incurred investments, expenses, or costs associated with facilities constructed,
owned, or operated by a utility to satisfy the requirements of section 216B.1691, provided those
facilities were previously approved by the commission under section 216B.2422 or 216B.243,
or were determined by the commission to be reasonable and prudent under section 216B.243,
subdivision 9. For facilities not subject to review by the commission under section 216B.2422 or
216B.243, a utility shall petition the commission for eligibility for cost recovery under this section
prior to requesting cost recovery for the facility. The commission may approve, or approve as
modified, a rate schedule that:
   (1) allows a utility to recover directly from customers on a timely basis the costs of qualifying
renewable energy projects, including:
   (i) return on investment;
   (ii) depreciation;
   (iii) ongoing operation and maintenance costs;
   (iv) taxes; and
   (v) costs of transmission and other ancillary expenses directly allocable to transmitting electricity
generated from a project meeting the specifications of this paragraph;
   (2) provides a current return on construction work in progress, provided that recovery of these
costs from Minnesota ratepayers is not sought through any other mechanism;
    (3) allows recovery of other expenses incurred that are directly related to a renewable
energy project, including expenses for energy storage, provided that the utility demonstrates
to the commission's satisfaction that the expenses improve project economics, ensure project
implementation, advance research and understanding of how storage devices may improve
renewable energy projects, or facilitate coordination with the development of transmission
necessary to transport energy produced by the project to market;
   (4) allocates recoverable costs appropriately between wholesale and retail customers;
    (5) terminates recovery when costs have been fully recovered or have otherwise been reflected
in a utility's rates.
   (b) A petition filed under this subdivision must include:
   (1) a description of the facilities for which costs are to be recovered;
   (2) an implementation schedule for the facilities;
   (3) the utility's costs for the facilities;
   (4) a description of the utility's efforts to ensure that costs of the facilities are reasonable and
were prudently incurred; and
    (5) a description of the benefits of the project in promoting the development of renewable energy
in a manner consistent with this chapter.

       EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
       Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.1691, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Eligible energy technology standard. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b),
each electric utility shall generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by an eligible energy
technology to provide its retail customers in Minnesota, or the retail customers of a distribution
utility to which the electric utility provides wholesale electric service, so that at least the following
standard percentages of the electric utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota
are generated by eligible energy technologies by the end of the year indicated:
 (1)                  2012                 12 percent
 (2)                  2016                 17 percent
 (3)                  2020                 20 percent
 (4)                  2025                 25 percent.

    (b) An electric utility that owned a nuclear generating facility as of January 1, 2007, must
meet the requirements of this paragraph rather than paragraph (a). An electric utility subject to this
paragraph must generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by an eligible energy technology
to provide its retail customers in Minnesota or the retail customer of a distribution utility to which
the electric utility provides wholesale electric service so that at least the following percentages

of the electric utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota are generated by
eligible energy technologies by the end of the year indicated:
(1)             2010          15 percent
(2)             2012          18 percent
(3)             2016          25 percent
(4)             2020          30 percent.

   Of the 30 percent in 2020, at least 25 percent must be generated by solar energy or wind energy
conversion systems and the remaining five percent by other eligible energy technology. Of the 25
percent that must be generated by wind or solar, no more than one percent may be solar generated
and the remaining 24 percent or greater must be wind generated.
      Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.23, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Authority to issue refund. On determining that a public utility has charged a rate
in violation of this chapter, a commission rule, or a commission order, the commission, after
conducting a proceeding, may require the public utility to refund to its customers, in a manner
approved by the commission, any revenues the commission finds were collected as a result of the
unlawful conduct. Any refund authorized by this section is permitted in addition to any remedies
authorized by section 216B.16 or any other law governing rates. Exercising authority under this
section does not preclude the commission from pursuing penalties under sections 216B.57 to
216B.61 for the same conduct. Nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing retroactive
ratemaking. In addition, nothing in this section shall be construed to allow refunds based on claims
that prior or current approved rates have been unjust, unreasonable, unreasonably preferential,
discriminatory, insufficient, inequitable, or inconsistent in application to a class of customers.
Moreover, nothing in this section shall be construed to allow refunds based on claims that approved
rates have not encouraged energy conservation, encouraged renewable energy use, or furthered
the goals of section 216B.164, 216B.241, or 216C.05. A refund under this subdivision shall not
apply to revenues collected more than six years prior to the date of the notice of the commission
proceeding.
      Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation
improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent
to 1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under
paragraph (d). The savings goals must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather
normalized average. A utility or association may elect to carry forward energy savings in excess
of 1.5 percent for a year to the succeeding three calendar years, except that savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects allowed under paragraph (d) may be carried forward for five years. A
particular energy savings can be used only for one year's goal.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy-savings plan by calendar year 2010.
1190                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [27TH DAY

    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request
the commissioner to adjust its annual energy-savings percentage goal based on its historical
conservation investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential
study, or other factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner
may not approve a plan that provides for an annual energy-savings goal of less than one percent of
gross annual retail energy sales from energy conservation improvements.
A utility or association may include in its energy conservation plan energy savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects approved by the commission under section 216B.1636 or waste
heat recovery converted into electricity projects that may count as energy savings in addition to
the minimum energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements.
Electric utility infrastructure projects must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that
which would have occurred through normal maintenance activity.
    (e) An energy-savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy-savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments to attain
the energy-savings goals of this subdivision that are not cost-effective even if the investment is
necessary to attain the energy-savings goals. For the purpose of this paragraph, in determining
cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and benefits to ratepayers, the
utility, participants, and society. In addition, the commissioner shall consider the rate at which an
association or municipal utility is increasing its energy savings and its expenditures on energy
conservation.
    (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available. The
commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity filing
an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner.
    (h) By January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall report to the legislature whether the spending
requirements under subdivisions 1a and 1b are necessary to achieve the energy-savings goals
established in this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5a. Qualifying solar energy project. (a) A utility or association may include in its
conservation plan programs for the installation of qualifying solar energy projects as defined
by section 216B.2411 to the extent of the spending allowed for generation projects by section
216B.2411. The cost-effectiveness of a qualifying solar energy project may be determined by
a different standard than for other energy conservation improvements under this section if the
commissioner determines it is in the public interest to do so to encourage solar energy projects.
Energy savings from qualifying solar energy projects may not be counted toward the minimum
energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements required under
subdivision 1c, but may, if the conservation plan is approved:

    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Building performance standards; Sustainable Building 2030. (a) The purpose of
this subdivision is to establish cost-effective energy-efficiency performance standards for new and
substantially reconstructed commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings that can significantly
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by lowering energy use in new and substantially reconstructed
buildings. For the purposes of this subdivision, the establishment of these standards may be referred
to as Sustainable Building 2030.
    (b) The commissioner shall contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research at
the University of Minnesota to coordinate development and implementation of energy-efficiency
performance standards, strategic planning, research, data analysis, technology transfer, training,
and other activities related to the purpose of Sustainable Building 2030. The commissioner and the
Center for Sustainable Building Research shall, in consultation with utilities, builders, developers,
building operators, and experts in building design and technology, develop a Sustainable Building
2030 implementation plan that must address, at a minimum, the following issues:
    (1) training architects to incorporate the performance standards in building design;
    (2) incorporating the performance standards in utility conservation improvement programs; and
    (3) developing procedures for ongoing monitoring of energy use in buildings that have adopted
the performance standards.
The plan must be submitted to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of
representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy by July 1, 2009.
    (c) Sustainable Building 2030 energy-efficiency performance standards must be firm,
quantitative measures of total building energy use and associated carbon dioxide emissions
per square foot for different building types and uses, that allow for accurate determinations
of a building's conformance with a performance standard. The energy-efficiency performance
standards must be updated every three or five years to incorporate all cost-effective measures. The
performance standards must reflect the reductions in carbon dioxide emissions per square foot
resulting from actions taken by utilities to comply with the renewable energy standards in section
216B.1691. The performance standards should be designed to achieve reductions equivalent to
the following reduction schedule, measured against energy consumption by an average building
in each applicable building sector in 2003: (1) 60 percent in 2010; (2) 70 percent in 2015; (3) 80
percent in 2020; and (4) 90 percent in 2025. A performance standard must not be established or
increased absent a conclusive engineering analysis that it is cost-effective based upon established
practices used in evaluating utility conservation improvement programs.

    (d) The annual amount of the contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research is up
to $500,000. The Center for Sustainable Building Research shall expend no more than $150,000 of
this amount each year on administration, coordination, and oversight activities related to Sustainable
Building 2030. The balance of contract funds must be spent for subcontracts with not-for-profit
energy organizations, architecture and engineering firms, and other qualified entities to undertake
technical projects and activities in support of Sustainable Building 2030. The primary work to be
accomplished each year by qualified technical experts under subcontracts is the development and
thorough justification of recommendations for specific energy-efficiency performance standards.
Additional work may include:
    (1) research, development, and demonstration of new energy-efficiency technologies and
techniques suitable for commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings;
    (2) analysis and evaluation of practices in building design, construction, commissioning and
operations, and analysis and evaluation of energy use in the commercial, industrial, and institutional
sectors;
   (3) analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Sustainable Building
2030 performance standards, conservation improvement programs, and building energy codes;
   (4) development and delivery of training programs for architects, engineers, commissioning
agents, technicians, contractors, equipment suppliers, developers, and others in the building
industries; and
   (5) analyze and evaluate the effect of building operations on energy use.
    (e) The commissioner shall require utilities to develop and implement conservation
improvement programs that are expressly designed to achieve energy efficiency goals consistent
with the Sustainable Building 2030 performance standards. These programs must include
offerings of design assistance and modeling, financial incentives, and the verification of the proper
installation of energy-efficient design components in new and substantially reconstructed buildings.
A utility's design assistance program must consider the strategic planting of trees and shrubs
around buildings as an energy conservation strategy for the designed project. A utility making
an expenditure under its conservation improvement program that results in a building meeting
the Sustainable Building 2030 performance standards may claim the energy savings toward its
energy-savings goal established in subdivision 1c.
    (f) The commissioner shall report to the legislature every three years, beginning January 15,
2010, on the cost-effectiveness and progress of implementing the Sustainable Building 2030
performance standards and shall make recommendations on the need to continue the program as
described in this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

interconnected capacity that is fueled by natural gas, renewable fuels, or another similarly clean
fuel; or
   (3) projects in Minnesota to install a qualifying solar energy project as defined in subdivision 2.
    (b) A municipality, rural electric association, or public utility that offers a program to customers
to promote installing qualifying solar energy projects may request authority from the commissioner
to exceed the five percent limit in paragraph (a), but not to exceed ten percent, to meet customer
demand for installation of qualifying solar energy projects. In considering this request, the
commissioner shall consider customer interest in qualifying solar energy and the impact on other
customers.
    (c) For public utilities, as defined under section 216B.02, subdivision 4, projects under this
section must be considered energy conservation improvements as defined in section 216B.241.
For cooperative electric associations and municipal utilities, projects under this section must be

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.2424, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Reduction of biomass mandate. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision 5, the biomass
electric energy mandate must be reduced from 125 megawatts to 110 megawatts.
    (b) The Public Utilities Commission shall approve a request pending before the commission
as of May 15, 2003, for amendments to and assignment of a power purchase agreement with the
owner of a facility that uses short-rotation, woody crops as its primary fuel previously approved
to satisfy a portion of the biomass mandate if the owner of the project agrees to reduce the size
of its project from 50 megawatts to 35 megawatts, while maintaining an average price for energy
in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement at or below $104 per
megawatt-hour, exclusive of any price adjustments that may take effect subsequent to commission
approval of the power purchase agreement, as amended. The commission shall also approve, as
necessary, any subsequent assignment or sale of the power purchase agreement or ownership of the
project to an entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal utilities located
north of Constitutional Route No. 8, as described in section 161.114, which currently own electric
and steam generation facilities using coal as a fuel and which propose to retrofit their existing
municipal electrical generating facilities to utilize biomass fuels in order to perform the power
purchase agreement.
    (c) If the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) is assigned to an entity that is,
or becomes, owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal entities as described in
paragraph (b), and the power purchase agreement meets the price requirements of paragraph (b), the
commission shall approve any amendments to the power purchase agreement necessary to reflect
the changes in project location and ownership and any other amendments made necessary by those
changes. The commission shall also specifically find that:
    (1) the power purchase agreement complies with and fully satisfies the provisions of this section
to the full extent of its 35-megawatt capacity;
   (2) all costs incurred by the public utility and all amounts to be paid by the public utility to the

project owner under the terms of the power purchase agreement are fully recoverable pursuant to
section 216B.1645;
   (3) subject to prudency review by the commission, the public utility may recover from its
Minnesota retail customers the Minnesota jurisdictional portion of the amounts that may be
incurred and paid by the public utility during the full term of the power purchase agreement; and
   (4) if the purchase power agreement meets the requirements of this subdivision, it is reasonable
and in the public interest.
    (d) The commission shall specifically approve recovery by the public utility of any and all
Minnesota jurisdictional costs incurred by the public utility to improve, construct, install, or upgrade
transmission, distribution, or other electrical facilities owned by the public utility or other persons
in order to permit interconnection of the retrofitted biomass-fueled generating facilities or to obtain
transmission service for the energy provided by the facilities to the public utility pursuant to section
216B.1645, and shall disapprove any provision in the power purchase agreement that requires the
developer or owner of the project to pay the jurisdictional costs or that permit the public utility to
terminate the power purchase agreement as a result of the existence of those costs or the public
utility's obligation to pay any or all of those costs.
    (e) Upon request by the project owner, the public utility shall agree to amend the power purchase
agreement described in paragraph (b) and approved by the commission as required by paragraph
(c). The amendment shall be negotiated and executed within 45 days of the effective date of this
section and shall apply to prices paid after January 1, 2009. In no event shall the average price for
energy in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement exceed $104 per
megawatt hour by more than five percent. The public utility shall request approval of the amendment
by the commission within 30 days of execution of the amended power purchase agreement. The
amendment is not effective until approval by the commission. The commission must act on the
amendment within 90 days of submission of the request by the public utility. Upon approval of the
amended power purchase agreement, the commission shall allow the public utility to recover the
costs of the amended power purchase agreement, as provided in section 216B.1645.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.243, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Exemptions. This section does not apply to:
   (1) cogeneration or small power production facilities as defined in the Federal Power Act,
United States Code, title 16, section 796, paragraph (17), subparagraph (A), and paragraph (18),
subparagraph (A), and having a combined capacity at a single site of less than 80,000 kilowatts;
plants or facilities for the production of ethanol or fuel alcohol; or any case where the commission
has determined after being advised by the attorney general that its application has been preempted
by federal law;
   (2) a high-voltage transmission line proposed primarily to distribute electricity to serve the
demand of a single customer at a single location, unless the applicant opts to request that the
commission determine need under this section or section 216B.2425;
    (3) the upgrade to a higher voltage of an existing transmission line that serves the demand of a
single customer that primarily uses existing rights-of-way, unless the applicant opts to request that

   (4) a high-voltage transmission line of one mile or less required to connect a new or upgraded
substation to an existing, new, or upgraded high-voltage transmission line;
      (5) conversion of the fuel source of an existing electric generating plant to using natural gas; or
    (6) the modification of an existing electric generating plant to increase efficiency, as long as the
capacity of the plant is not increased more than ten percent or more than 100 megawatts, whichever

and what specific progress is being made to meet that need. To the extent possible, the report must
contain a description of specific transmission needs and the current status of proposals to address that
need. The report must identify any barriers to meeting transmission infrastructure needs and make
recommendations, including any legislation, that are necessary to overcome those barriers. The
report must be based on the best available information and must describe what assumptions are made
as the basis for the report. If the commissioner determines that there are difficulties in accurately
assessing future transmission infrastructure needs, the commissioner shall explain those difficulties
as part of the report. The commissioner is not required to conduct original research to support the
report. The commissioner may utilize information the commissioner, the commission, and the Office
of Energy Security possess and utilize in carrying out their existing statutory duties related to the
state's transmission infrastructure. The report must be in easily understood, nontechnical terms.

216B.097, including the number of households disconnected or denied fuel and the duration of the
disconnections or denials.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 22. LEGISLATIVE ENERGY COMMISSION; STUDY.
    The Legislative Energy Commission must study the conservation improvement program under
Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.241. The study can include any aspect of the program but must
include the following issues:
    (1) proper credit to utilities and associations for conservation caused by utility or association
activity with a focus on educational activity designed to induce behavior that causes conservation;
   (2) the use of third parties to develop or implement conservation improvement plans either
completely or as a supplement to utility and association activities; and
    (3) a mechanism so that utilities and associations can invest in plans statewide if that produces
the best conservation results.
  Sec. 23. APPLIANCE                  ENERGY         STANDARDS;           LEGISLATIVE           ENERGY
COMMISSION.
   The Legislative Energy Commission shall analyze the adoption of state energy use standards for
appliances it determines consume a significant amount of energy statewide and for which the state
1198                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [27TH DAY

is not preempted by federal law from adopting standards. Televisions must be one of the appliances
for which a standard must be analyzed. The analysis must include:
   (1) consideration of the effect of the standard on the appliance market in the state;
   (2) the effect of the standard on consumer costs of purchasing and operating an appliance;
   (3) technical ability to comply with a standard currently and in the future; and
   (4) energy savings achievable by a standard.
  Sec. 24. LEGISLATIVE ENERGY COMMISSION; LOW-CARBON FUEL STANDARD
STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
    The Legislative Energy Commission shall study and make recommendations on whether and
how to implement a low-carbon fuel standard for transportation fuels used in motor vehicles. The
standard would be designed to reduce the carbon content of those transportation fuels over time in an
amount the commission determines appropriate considering the full range of societal impacts caused
by the reduction, including environmental and economic impacts. The commission shall submit a
report on the results of the study along with legislative recommendations by January 15, 2010, to
the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with primary jurisdiction
over energy issues.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 25. NATURAL GAS UTILITIES; INTERIM ENERGY SAVINGS PLAN.
   The commissioner of commerce may approve an energy conservation improvement plan under
Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.241, subdivision 1c, paragraph (d), that:
    (1) is submitted to the commissioner in calendar year 2009 by a utility that provides natural gas
service at retail;
    (2) governs the conservation improvements to be undertaken by the utility over the next
three-year time period; and
    (3) is accompanied by a conservation potential study that specifies how the utility may meet and
exceed the minimum energy savings goal of one percent of gross annual retail energy sales within
five years of submission of the plan.
    Nothing in this section precludes the commissioner from requiring additional energy
conservation improvement activities and programs beyond those proposed by the utility in its
proposed plan as long as those additional activities and programs meet the requirements of
Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.241. The commissioner shall require all reasonable actions by
the utility that will increase the likelihood of the utility meeting and exceeding the minimum one
percent energy savings goal and the 1.5 percent goal as soon as reasonably feasible.
   Sec. 26. RESIDENTIAL ENERGY USE DISCLOSURE; STUDY AND REPORT.
    (a) The Legislative Energy Commission shall study the issue of disclosing the energy use of
a residence to a purchaser or renter. For purposes of this section, "residence" includes single-
and multiple-family dwellings, apartments, and manufactured homes. The study must include

consideration of:
    (1) the energy consumption information an energy supplier, including a utility, should furnish to
a residential property owner;
   (2) whether different types of energy use information disclosure should be required for existing
and newly constructed residences;
   (3) the energy use information that would be useful to a purchaser or renter of a residence; and
   (4) when and to which prospective or actual purchasers or renters disclosure should be made.
    (b) The commission shall convene a stakeholder group to assist in the study that must include,
among others, residential builders, apartment owners, tenant advocates, manufactured home park
owners, a nonprofit organization representing manufactured home park residents, utilities, real estate
professionals, energy advocates, and consumers. The commission shall report the results of the
study along with any recommended legislation to the chairs and ranking minority members of the
committees of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over energy policy by January 15, 2010.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 27. UTILITY RATES STUDY.
    The Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with the Office of Energy Security, shall
conduct a study of automatic cost-recovery mechanisms and alternative forms of utility rate
regulation. This study shall include an assessment of the impact of automatic cost-recovery
mechanisms on prices charged to utility consumers compared to traditional cost-recovery
mechanisms, an assessment of the impact of automatic recovery mechanisms on the level of
customer understanding of utility rates compared to traditional cost-recovery mechanisms, and an
assessment of alternative forms of utility rate regulation that may be used in place of automatic
cost-recovery mechanisms. The study shall also address methods to improve administration and
customer understanding of automatic cost-recovery mechanisms. The commission shall submit
this report to the legislature on or before June 30, 2010. The commission may assess public utilities
for the cost of the study. The assessment is not subject to a cap on assessments provided by section
216B.62 or any other law.
   Sec. 28. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
   (a) The revisor of statutes shall replace the phrase "parts 7820.1500 to 7820.2300" in Minnesota
Rules, part 7826.0200, with the phrase "Minnesota Statutes, sections 216B.096 and 216B.097."

    7.4 An amendment to an omnibus appropriation or tax bill that is a Senate file is out of order if

    7.5 An amendment to an omnibus appropriation or tax bill that is a Senate file is out of order if

1208                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [27TH DAY

to make its appointments pursuant to this rule, the majority group may make all the committee and

    10.5 A member may not serve as the chair of the same standing committee or the same division

a complaint that members have violated the open meeting requirements of Minnesota Statutes,

Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration shall immediately forward it in writing to
the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct without disclosing the identity of the complainant. The
complaint must not be further disclosed without the consent of the complainant, except to the
members against whom the complaint was made, unless the complaint was made by a member of
the Senate in writing under oath, in which case the investigatory procedures of Rule 55 apply.
   12.3 To the extent practical, a committee, subcommittee, or division shall announce each meeting
27TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 30, 2009                                        1209

to the public at least three calendar days before convening. The notice must state the name of the
committee, subcommittee, or division, the bill or bills to be considered, and the place and time of
meeting. A bill may not be considered on the day it was introduced, except by a vote of two-thirds of
the members of the committee, subcommittee, or division. The notice must be posted on the Senate's
Web site and on all Senate bulletin boards in the Capitol and the State Office Building. A notice must

requirement cannot be met, the committee, subcommittee, or division shall give simultaneous notice
to all of the known proponents and opponents of the bill as soon as practicable.
   12.4 A Senate committee, subcommittee, or division shall adjourn no later than 10:00 p.m. each
day, unless two-thirds of the members present vote to suspend this requirement.
   12.5 Committees, subcommittees, and divisions may not meet while the Senate is in session
without permission of the Senate. The names of the members excused shall be printed in the Journal.

jurisdiction, report hearings held by it, and make expenditures as authorized by the Committee on
Rules and Administration.
   12.8 A standing committee, but not a subcommittee or division, may require by subpoena or
otherwise the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of correspondence, books,
papers, and documents, in the manner provided by Minnesota Statutes, section 3.153.
   12.9 Upon the request of a member of a committee, subcommittee, or division to which a bill
has been referred, or upon the request of the chief author of the bill, a record must be made of the
vote on the bill or any amendment in the committee, subcommittee, or division.
    12.10 Upon request of three members of the committee before the vote is taken, the record of a
roll call vote in a standing committee must accompany the committee report and be printed in the
Journal.
    12.11 A committee report may only be based on action taken at a regular or special meeting of
the committee. A report in violation of this rule is out of order.


                                  13. HOUR OF CONVENING
    If the Senate adjourns without setting a time to reconvene, the Senate shall convene on the next

                                         14. PRESIDENT

the regular order of business.
   14.2 The President may call a member to preside. In the absence of the President, the President
Pro Tem, the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration, or the Chair's designee, shall

member to perform the duties of the President. Substitutions do not extend beyond adjournment.
   14.3 The President shall preserve order and decorum, may speak on points of order in preference
to members, and shall also decide all questions of order, subject to an appeal to the Senate by a
member.
    14.4 An appeal is decided by a majority vote of those present and voting. Upon an appeal from
the decision of the President, the question is, "Shall the decision of the President be the judgment
of the Senate?"
   14.5 The President shall sign all acts, memorials, addresses and resolutions. All writs, warrants,
and subpoenas issued by the Senate must be signed by the President and attested by the Secretary.
    14.6 Upon a finding by the Committee on Rules and Administration that the President refuses or
is unable to sign any of the documents described in this rule, the Chair of the Committee on Rules
and Administration, or some other member selected by the committee, shall assume the duties of
the President under this rule until the President is able to sign the documents described or until the

                       21. OBJECTIONS TO COMMITTEE REFERRALS
    A member may question the proper reference of a bill at the time the bill is reported by a standing
committee to which it was previously referred. When a member questions the reference of a bill,
the bill must be referred without debate to the Committee on Rules and Administration to report the
proper reference. Upon adoption of the report of the Committee on Rules and Administration, the

available or printed at least one calendar day before being considered in Committee of the Whole.

  23.2 The President may call a member to the Chair when the Senate resolves itself into the
Committee of the Whole.
    23.3 The rules observed in the Senate govern, as far as practicable, the proceedings of the
Committee of the Whole, and the Chair of the Committee of the Whole has the powers of the
President, as appropriate. However, a member may speak more than twice on the same subject and
a call for the previous question may not be made.
   23.4 Three members may request a roll call vote. The vote must be recorded in the Journal along
with the amendment.
   23.5 The recommendations of the Committee of the Whole must be reported to the Senate. The

must be placed on the Calendar.

committee may recommend that the bill be placed on the Consent Calendar. If the committee report
is adopted, the bill must be electronically available or printed and placed on the Consent Calendar
after its second reading. On the question of adoption of the report, the question of accepting the
recommendation that the bill be placed on the Consent Calendar may be divided from the question
of adopting the report in other respects.
  25.2 A majority of the whole Senate, or the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration,
may order a bill on General Orders placed on the Consent Calendar.
   25.3 The Consent Calendar must be electronically available or printed at least one calendar day

    25.4 If a member objects to consideration of a bill on the Consent Calendar at any time during its
consideration in the Senate before the question on final passage is put, and that objection is supported
by at least two other members, the bill is referred to the Committee of the Whole, and the Secretary
shall place it at the bottom of General Orders subject to Rule 22.2, except that it need not lie over
one calendar day before consideration in the Committee of the Whole.

occasions to take the bill up after it was designated a special order.


                                           27. MOTIONS
    27.1 A motion or amendment must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
or committee offering it.
   27.2 When a motion is made, it must be stated by the President. If it is in writing, it must be
handed to the Secretary and read to the members.
   27.3 After a motion is stated by the President, or read by the Secretary, it is in possession of the
Senate, but may be withdrawn by the author at any time before decision or amendment.


                               28. PRECEDENCE OF MOTIONS

        3. To reconsider.
        4. To lay on the table.
        5. For the previous question.

          8. To amend.
          9. To postpone indefinitely.
   28.2 Motions numbered 1, 2, 4 and 5 above are not debatable.
   28.3 These motions have precedence in the foregoing order; but when a motion for the previous
question has been made, or the main question ordered, a motion to lay on the table is not in order.
   28.4 A motion to postpone to a day certain, to refer, to postpone indefinitely, or to amend, having
been decided, may not again be put on the same day, nor at the same stage of the bill or proposition.


                                   29. MOTION TO ADJOURN
    A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to a time certain is always in order. The latter motion
is debatable solely as to the time. When either motion is rejected, it may not be renewed until further
business has been transacted.


                                30. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
    30.1 When a motion or question has been decided, a member who voted with the prevailing side
may move for reconsideration on the same day on which the vote was taken or within the next two
calendar days or, if later, the first day the Senate meets after the vote was taken. The motion takes
precedence over all other questions except a motion to adjourn or recess. When a motion to adjourn
is adopted before the disposition of the motion for reconsideration, a motion for reconsideration
must lie over until the next succeeding day the Senate meets except as provided in this rule.
    30.2 When notice of intent to move reconsideration of the final action of the Senate on a question
is given by a member, the Secretary shall retain the subject of the notice until after the expiration of
the time during which the motion can be made.
    30.3 A notice of intent to move for reconsideration is not in order after the Tuesday before the
third Saturday in May, but a motion to reconsider may be made.
   30.4 A motion for reconsideration having been once voted on may not be made again nor
reconsidered.


                       31. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION
   31.1 Unless a motion for the previous question is made specifically applicable to a subsidiary
motion, it must be in this form: "Shall the main question now be put?" If the motion for the previous
question is supported by a majority of the members present, its effect is to put an end to all debate
and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon all pending amendments in their order and then upon the
main question.
   31.2 On a motion for the previous question, a call of the Senate is in order before the President
submits the question to the Senate.
    31.3 On a motion for the previous question there is no debate. All incidental questions of order,
arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and pending the motion, must be decided,
1216                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [27TH DAY

whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate.


                                     32. MOTION TO REFER
     A bill or resolution may be referred to committee at any time before its passage. If an amendment
is reported on the referral to any committee other than the Committee of the Whole, it must again be
read the second time, considered in Committee of the Whole, read the third time and placed on final
passage. If the referral is to the Committee of the Whole it must be placed at the head of General
Orders, except when the referral is from the Consent Calendar under Rule 25.4.


                      33. MOTION TO AMEND BILL OR RESOLUTION
    33.1 A motion to amend must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
offering it.
    33.2 In drawing an amendment to a bill or resolution, reference must be made, first to the number
of the bill, then to the page, and then to the line or lines where language is to be stricken or inserted.
    33.3 In filling blanks, the largest sum, the longest time and the greatest distance must be first
taken.
   33.4 The title to a bill may be amended by the Secretary at any time the bill is amended by the
Senate.
    33.5 An amendment is not in order to a bill on the Calendar or after third reading without the
unanimous consent of the Senate unless it fills a blank, amends the title, is proposed to the chief
author of the bill by the Revisor of Statutes to correct technical defects found by the Revisor while
engrossing earlier amendments to the bill, or is proposed to a bill on the Consent Calendar before
the bill is given its third reading.


                               34. MOTION TO SUSPEND RULES
   34.1 A rule may be suspended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole Senate.
    34.2 A motion to suspend the rules for the purpose of advancing a bill may be made only under
the order of business, "Motions and Resolutions".

    35.1 An amendment proposed to the Senate or to the Committee of the Whole that is not germane
is out of order.
     35.2 A non-germane amendment includes one that relates to a substantially different subject, or
is intended to accomplish a substantially different purpose, than that of the original bill to which it
is proposed.
    35.3 An amendment to insert a constitutional amendment is not germane to a bill that does not
already include a constitutional amendment.
27TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 30, 2009                                       1217

   35.4 Whether an amendment is germane is to be decided by the President, who may put the
question to the body if the President chooses.
    35.5 A motion to remove an amendment placed on a House bill under Rule 45.1 is out of order
if removal of the amendment would make a portion of the House bill not germane to the Senate
companion for which it was substituted.
    35.6 If a House amendment to a Senate bill is not germane to the Senate bill, a motion to concur
in the House amendment is out of order.

    36.1 When a member is about to speak to the Senate, the member shall rise and respectfully

or not the member is in order. If a member is called to order for words spoken in debate, the words
excepted to must be taken down in writing by the Secretary immediately.


                                 37. ABSENCE OF MEMBERS

the whole Senate, or until the Senate adjourns.
   38.4 A majority of the whole Senate may excuse members not answering the call.
   38.5 A call may not be imposed after voting has commenced.

    39.1 A member may call for a division of the question when the division is possible. A motion
to strike and insert is indivisible.
    39.2 The defeat of a motion to strike does not preclude an amendment nor a motion to strike and
insert.

of the Whole, shall vote upon the request of another member unless excused by the Senate.

    45.1 A House bill, after its first reading, must be referred as follows, unless there is a motion by
the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration or a designee of the Chair:
    (a) If there is no Senate companion bill, the House bill must be referred to the appropriate
standing committee, unless there is objection under Rule 4.10.
   (b) If there is a Senate companion bill, the House bill must be referred to the standing committee

to the Senate companion bill. If the bills are identical, the report must recommend that the House bill

proposed amendment, the House bill as amended must be given its second reading and substituted
for the Senate companion bill and the Senate companion bill must be indefinitely postponed.

the Committee on Rules and Administration. The subcommittee consists of three members, one of
whom must be a member of the minority group.
    46.2 The Subcommittee on Conference Committees shall appoint all conference committees of
the Senate and report the appointments to the Senate. In the appointment of members of conference
committees between the two houses, the Subcommittee on Conference Committees shall appoint
those who are in accord with the position of the Senate. Whenever practical, the subcommittee shall
give preference to authors of bills in dispute and to members of standing committees in which the
bills were considered.


                     47. DISPOSITION OF BILLS ON ADJOURNMENT
    Adjournment of the regular session in an odd-numbered year to a date certain in the following
year is equivalent to daily adjournment, except that a bill on the Calendar, Consent Calendar, General

conference committee has been discharged under Joint Rule 3.02, must be returned to the standing
committee other than the Committee on Rules and Administration from which it was last reported to
the Senate, unless otherwise provided for by motion before adjournment. Bills returned to committee
under this rule must, upon request of the chief author, be given priority for consideration by the
committee in the even-numbered year ahead of all other bills in the order in which they appeared
on the Calendar, Consent Calendar, or General Orders.


                       48. PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF BILLS

executive session may be ordered by a vote of three of its members whenever the subcommittee

proceedings on the complaint are open to the public.

its proceedings. The subcommittee may appoint a suitable person to conduct the investigation and

classification, profession, or occupation, shall disclose the potential conflict of interest by following

lobbyist's appearance.
    58.2 A lobbyist shall not knowingly, either directly or through a third party, furnish false or
misleading information or make a false or misleading statement that is relevant and material to a
matter before the Senate or any of its committees when the lobbyist knows or should know it will
influence the judgment or action of the Senate or any of its committees, subcommittees, or divisions.
    58.3 The Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct shall investigate a complaint by a member of the
Senate in writing under oath received before adjournment sine die in the last year of a Senate
term or during a special session held after that time that a lobbyist has violated Rule 58.1 or 58.2.
The investigatory procedures of Rule 55 apply, except as provided in this rule. The complaint and
proceedings on the complaint are private until the subcommittee has found probable cause to believe
that a violation of Rule 58.1 or 58.2 has occurred, unless they are made public by the lobbyist whose
conduct is the subject of the complaint or by the vote of at least three members of the subcommittee.
