   Sec. 6. [84.7741] OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE FORFEITURE.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings
given them.
    (b) "Appropriate agency" means a law enforcement agency that has the authority to make an
arrest for a violation of a designated offense.
   (c) "Claimant" means an owner of an off-highway vehicle or a person claiming a leasehold or
security interest in an off-highway vehicle.
   (d) "Designated offense" means a second gross misdemeanor violation under section 84.774,
paragraph (b).
   (e) "Family or household member" means:
   (1) a parent, stepparent, or guardian;
    (2) any of the following persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption: brother, sister,
stepbrother, stepsister, first cousin, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, grandparent, great-grandparent,
great-uncle, or great-aunt; or
   (3) persons residing together or persons who regularly associate and communicate with one
another outside of a workplace setting.
    (f) "Off-highway vehicle" and "vehicle" do not include an off-highway vehicle that is stolen or
taken in violation of the law.
   (g) "Owner" means a person legally entitled to possession, use, and control of an off-highway
vehicle, including a lessee of an off-highway vehicle if the lease agreement has a term of 180 days
or more. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person registered as the owner of an off-highway
5714                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [55TH DAY

vehicle according to the records of the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Natural
Resources is the legal owner. For purposes of this section, if an off-highway vehicle is owned jointly
by two or more people, each owner's interest extends to the whole of the vehicle and is not subject
to apportionment.
    (h) "Prosecuting authority" means the attorney in the jurisdiction in which the designated
offense occurred, or a designee, who is responsible for prosecuting violations of a designated
offense. If a state agency initiated the forfeiture and the attorney responsible for prosecuting the
designated offense declines to pursue forfeiture, the attorney general's office, or its designee, may
initiate forfeiture under this section.
    (i) "Security interest" means a bona fide security interest perfected according to section 168A.17,
subdivision 2, based on a loan or other financing that, if an off-highway vehicle is required to be
registered under chapter 168, is listed on the vehicle's title.
    Subd. 2. Seizure. (a) An off-highway vehicle subject to forfeiture under this section may be
seized by the appropriate agency upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the
vehicle.
   (b) Property may be seized without process if:
   (1) the seizure is incident to a lawful arrest or a lawful search;
    (2) the vehicle subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in
a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this section; or
    (3) the appropriate agency has probable cause to believe that the delay occasioned by the
necessity to obtain process would result in the removal or destruction of the vehicle. If property
is seized without process under this clause, the prosecuting authority must institute a forfeiture
action under this section as soon as is reasonably possible by serving a notice of seizure and intent
to forfeit at the address of the owner as listed in the records of the Department of Public Safety or
Department of Natural Resources.
    Subd. 3. Right to possession vests immediately; custody. All right, title, and interest in an
off-highway vehicle subject to forfeiture under this section vests in the appropriate agency upon
commission of the conduct resulting in the designated offense giving rise to the forfeiture. Any
vehicle seized under this section is not subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody of
the appropriate agency subject to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the
forfeiture proceedings. When an off-highway vehicle is seized under this section, the appropriate
agency may:
   (1) place the vehicle under seal;
   (2) remove the vehicle to a place designated by the agency;
   (3) place a disabling device on the vehicle; and
   (4) take other steps reasonable and necessary to secure the vehicle and prevent waste.
    Subd. 4. Bond by owner for possession. If the owner of an off-highway vehicle that has been
seized under this section seeks possession of the vehicle before the forfeiture action is determined,
the owner may, subject to the approval of the appropriate agency, give security or post bond payable
55TH DAY]                              FRIDAY, MAY 15, 2009                                          5715

to the appropriate agency in an amount equal to the retail value of the seized vehicle. On posting
the security or bond, the seized vehicle may be returned to the owner. The forfeiture action must
proceed against the security as if it were the seized vehicle.
   Subd. 5. Evidence. Certified copies of court records and off-highway vehicle and driver's records
concerning prior incidents are admissible as substantive evidence where necessary to prove the
commission of a designated offense.
    Subd. 6. Vehicle subject to forfeiture. An off-highway vehicle is subject to forfeiture under this
section if it was used in the commission of a designated offense.
   Subd. 7. Presumptions; limitations on vehicle forfeiture. (a) An off-highway vehicle is
presumed subject to forfeiture under this section if the driver:
   (1) is convicted of the designated offense upon which the forfeiture is based; or
   (2) fails to appear for a scheduled court appearance with respect to the designated offense charged
and fails to voluntarily surrender within 48 hours after the time required for appearance.
    (b) An off-highway vehicle encumbered by a security interest perfected according to section
168A.17, subdivision 2, or subject to a lease that has a term of 180 days or more, is subject to the
interest of the secured party or lessor unless the party or lessor had knowledge of or consented to the
act upon which the forfeiture is based. However, when the proceeds of the sale of a seized vehicle do
not equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance, the appropriate agency shall remit all proceeds of
the sale to the secured party after deducting the agency's costs for the seizure, tow, storage, forfeiture,
and sale of the vehicle. If the sale of the vehicle is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner
consistent with section 336.9-610, the agency is not liable to the secured party for any amount owed
on the loan in excess of the sale proceeds. The validity and amount of a nonperfected security interest
must be established by its holder by clear and convincing evidence.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the secured party's or lessor's interest in an off-highway
vehicle is not subject to forfeiture based solely on the secured party's or lessor's knowledge of the
act or omission upon which the forfeiture is based if the secured party or lessor demonstrates by
clear and convincing evidence that the party or lessor took reasonable steps to terminate use of the
vehicle by the offender.
    (d) An off-highway vehicle is not subject to forfeiture under this section if its owner can
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the owner did not have actual or constructive
knowledge that the vehicle would be used or operated in any manner contrary to law or that the
owner took reasonable steps to prevent use of the vehicle by the offender. If the offender is a family
or household member of the owner and has three or more prior off-highway vehicle convictions,
the owner is presumed to know of any vehicle use by the offender that is contrary to law.
   Subd. 8. Administrative forfeiture procedure. (a) An off-highway vehicle used to commit a
designated offense is subject to administrative forfeiture under this subdivision.
    (b) When an off-highway vehicle is seized under subdivision 2, or within a reasonable time
after seizure, the appropriate agency shall serve the driver or operator of the vehicle with a notice
of the seizure and intent to forfeit the vehicle. Additionally, when an off-highway vehicle is seized
under subdivision 2, or within a reasonable time after that, all persons known to have an ownership,
possessory, or security interest in the vehicle must be notified of the seizure and the intent to forfeit
5716                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [55TH DAY

the vehicle. For those vehicles required to be registered under chapter 168, the notification to a
person known to have a security interest in the vehicle is required only if the vehicle is registered
under chapter 168 and the interest is listed on the vehicle's title. Notice mailed by certified mail to the
address shown in Department of Public Safety records is sufficient notice to the registered owner
of the vehicle. For off-highway vehicles not required to be registered under chapter 168, notice
mailed by certified mail to the address shown in the applicable filing or registration for the vehicle
is sufficient notice to a person known to have an ownership, possessory, or security interest in the
vehicle. Otherwise, notice may be given in the manner provided by law for service of a summons
in a civil action.
   (c) The notice must be in writing and contain:
   (1) a description of the vehicle seized;
   (2) the date of the seizure; and
    (3) notice of the right to obtain judicial review of the forfeiture and of the procedure for obtaining
that judicial review, printed in English, Hmong, and Spanish. Substantially, the following language
must appear conspicuously: "IF YOU DO NOT DEMAND JUDICIAL REVIEW EXACTLY
AS PRESCRIBED IN MINNESOTA STATUTES, SECTION 84.7741, SUBDIVISION 8, YOU
LOSE THE RIGHT TO A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF THIS FORFEITURE AND YOU
LOSE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED PROPERTY. YOU MAY
NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FILING FEE FOR THE DEMAND IF DETERMINED YOU ARE
UNABLE TO AFFORD THE FEE. IF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH $7,500 OR LESS, YOU
MAY FILE YOUR CLAIM IN CONCILIATION COURT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE
CONCILIATION COURT FILING FEE IF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH LESS THAN $500."
    (d) Within 30 days following service of a notice of seizure and forfeiture under this subdivision,
a claimant may file a demand for a judicial determination of the forfeiture. The demand must be in
the form of a civil complaint and must be filed with the court administrator in the county in which
the seizure occurred, together with proof of service of a copy of the complaint on the prosecuting
authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture and the standard filing fee for civil actions unless
the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the value of the seized
property is $7,500 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of the
seized vehicle. A copy of the conciliation court statement of claim must be served personally or by
mail on the prosecuting authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture within 30 days following
service of the notice of seizure and forfeiture under this subdivision. If the value of the seized
property is less than $500, the claimant does not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee. No
responsive pleading is required of the prosecuting authority and no court fees may be charged for
the prosecuting authority's appearance in the matter. Pleadings, filings, and methods of service are
governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (e) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
vehicle as defendant and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges the
vehicle was improperly seized, the claimant's interest in the vehicle seized, and any affirmative
defenses the claimant may have. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return
of an off-highway vehicle seized under this section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any
person who has been served with a notice of seizure and forfeiture unless the person has complied
with this subdivision.
55TH DAY]                             FRIDAY, MAY 15, 2009                                        5717

    (f) If the claimant makes a timely demand for a judicial determination under this subdivision,
the forfeiture proceedings must be conducted according to subdivision 9.
     Subd. 9. Judicial forfeiture procedure. (a) This subdivision governs judicial determinations of
the forfeiture of an off-highway vehicle used to commit a designated offense. An action for forfeiture
is a civil in rem action and is independent of any criminal prosecution. All proceedings are governed
by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (b) If no demand for judicial determination of the forfeiture is pending, the prosecuting authority
may, in the name of the jurisdiction pursuing the forfeiture, file a separate complaint against the
vehicle, describing it, specifying that it was used in the commission of a designated offense, and
specifying the time and place of its unlawful use.
    (c) The prosecuting authority may file an answer to a properly served demand for judicial
determination, including an affirmative counterclaim for forfeiture. The prosecuting authority is
not required to file an answer.
    (d) A judicial determination under this subdivision must not precede adjudication in the
criminal prosecution of the designated offense without the consent of the prosecuting authority.
The district court administrator shall schedule the hearing as soon as practicable after adjudication
in the criminal prosecution. The district court administrator shall establish procedures to ensure
efficient compliance with this subdivision. The hearing is to the court without a jury.
    (e) There is a presumption that an off-highway vehicle seized under this section is subject to
forfeiture if the prosecuting authority establishes that the vehicle was used in the commission of a
designated offense. A claimant bears the burden of proving any affirmative defense raised.
   (f) If the forfeiture is based on the commission of a designated offense and the person charged
with the designated offense appears in court as required and is not convicted of the offense, the court
shall order the property returned to the person legally entitled to it upon that person's compliance
with the redemption requirements of subdivision 12.
    (g) If the lawful ownership of the vehicle used in the commission of a designated offense can
be determined and the owner makes the demonstration required under subdivision 7, paragraph
(d), the vehicle must be returned immediately upon the owner's compliance with the redemption
requirements of subdivision 12.
     (h) If the court orders the return of a seized vehicle under this subdivision, it must order that
filing fees be reimbursed to the person who filed the demand for judicial determination. In addition,
the court may order sanctions under section 549.211. Any reimbursement fees or sanctions must
be paid from other forfeiture proceeds of the law enforcement agency and prosecuting authority
involved and in the same proportion as distributed under subdivision 10, paragraph (b).
   Subd. 10. Disposition of forfeited vehicle. (a) If the vehicle is administratively forfeited under
subdivision 8, or if the court finds under subdivision 9 that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture under
subdivisions 6 and 7, the appropriate agency shall:
   (1) sell the vehicle and distribute the proceeds under paragraph (b); or
    (2) keep the vehicle for official use. If the agency keeps a forfeited off-highway vehicle for
official use, the agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the off-highway vehicle is
5718                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [55TH DAY

available for use by the agency's officers who participate in off-highway vehicle enforcement or
education programs.
    (b) The proceeds from the sale of forfeited vehicles, after payment of seizure, towing, storage,
forfeiture, and sale expenses and satisfaction of valid liens against the property, must be distributed
as follows:
   (1) 70 percent of the proceeds must be forwarded to the appropriate agency for deposit as a
supplement to the state or local agency's operating fund or similar fund for use in purchasing
equipment for off-highway vehicle enforcement, training, and education; and
    (2) 30 percent of the money or proceeds must be forwarded to the prosecuting authority
that handled the forfeiture for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for
prosecutorial purposes.
    Subd. 11. Sale of forfeited vehicle by secured party. (a) A financial institution with a valid
security interest in or a valid lease covering a forfeited off-highway vehicle may choose to dispose
of the vehicle under this subdivision, in lieu of the appropriate agency disposing of the vehicle
under subdivision 10. A financial institution wishing to dispose of an off-highway vehicle under
this subdivision shall notify the appropriate agency of its intent, in writing, within 30 days after
receiving notice of the seizure and forfeiture. The appropriate agency shall release the vehicle to
the financial institution or its agent after the financial institution presents proof of its valid security
agreement or of its lease agreement and the financial institution agrees not to sell the vehicle to a
family or household member of the violator, unless the violator is not convicted of the offense on
which the forfeiture is based. The financial institution shall dispose of the vehicle in a commercially
reasonable manner as defined in section 336.9-610.
    (b) After disposing of the forfeited vehicle, the financial institution shall reimburse the
appropriate agency for its seizure, storage, and forfeiture costs. The financial institution may then
apply the proceeds of the sale to its storage costs, to its sale expenses, and to satisfy the lien or the
lease on the vehicle. If any proceeds remain, the financial institution shall forward the proceeds to
the state treasury, which shall credit the appropriate fund as specified in subdivision 10.
    Subd. 12. Redemption requirements. (a) If an off-highway vehicle is seized by a peace officer
for a designated offense, the seized vehicle must be released only:
    (1) to the registered owner, a person authorized by the registered owner, a lienholder of record, or
a person who has purchased the vehicle from the registered owner who provides proof of ownership
of the vehicle;
   (2) if the vehicle is subject to a rental or lease agreement, to a renter or lessee who provides a
copy of the rental or lease agreement; or
   (3) to an agent of a towing company authorized by a registered owner if the owner provides
proof of ownership of the vehicle.
   (b) The proof of ownership or, if applicable, the copy of the rental or lease agreement required
under paragraph (a) must be provided to the law enforcement agency seizing the vehicle or to a
person or entity designated by the law enforcement agency to receive the information.
   (c) No law enforcement agency, local unit of government, or state agency is responsible or

financially liable for any storage fees incurred due to a seizure under this section.

main-traveled lanes of an interstate highway, or roadway shoulder or inside bank of a public road
right-of-way when required for the purpose of avoiding obstructions to travel or environmentally
sensitive areas when no other method of avoidance is possible; provided the all-terrain vehicle is

highways, except for those provisions relating to required equipment and except those provisions
which by their nature have no application.
    (f) A sled, trailer, or other device being towed by an all-terrain vehicle must be equipped with
reflective materials as required by rule of the commissioner.
   (g) A driver's license is not required to operate an all-terrain vehicle along or on a public

   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103B.3355, is amended to read:
   103B.3355 WETLAND FUNCTIONS FOR DETERMINING PUBLIC VALUES.
   (a) The public values of wetlands must be determined based upon the functions of wetlands for:
    (1) water quality, including filtering of pollutants to surface and groundwater, utilization of
nutrients that would otherwise pollute public waters, trapping of sediments, shoreline protection,
and utilization of the wetland as a recharge area for groundwater;
    (2) floodwater and stormwater retention, including the potential for flooding in the watershed,
the value of property subject to flooding, and the reduction in potential flooding by the wetland;
   (3) public recreation and education, including hunting and fishing areas, wildlife viewing areas,
and nature areas;
   (4) commercial uses, including wild rice and cranberry growing and harvesting and aquaculture;
   (5) fish, wildlife, native plant habitats;
   (6) low-flow augmentation; ­
                              a­
                               nd­
   (7) carbon sequestration; and
   (8) other public uses.
    (b) The Board of Water and Soil Resources, in consultation with the commissioners of natural
resources and agriculture and local government units, shall adopt rules establishing:
   (1) scientific methodologies for determining the functions of wetlands; and
   (2) criteria for determining the resulting public values of wetlands.
     (c) The methodologies and criteria established under this section or other methodologies and
criteria that include the functions in paragraph (a) and are approved by the board, in consultation
with the commissioners of natural resources and agriculture and local government units, must be
used to determine the functions and resulting public values of wetlands in the state. The functions
listed in paragraph (a) are not listed in order of priority.

    (d) Public value criteria established or approved by the board under this section do not apply in
areas subject to local comprehensive wetland protection and management plans established under
section 103G.2243.
    (e) The Board of Water and Soil Resources, in consultation with the commissioners of natural
resources and agriculture and local government units, may identify regions of the state where
preservation, enhancement, restoration, and establishment of wetlands would have high public
value. The board, in consultation with the commissioners, may identify high priority wetland
regions using available information relating to the factors listed in paragraph (a). The board shall
notify local units of government with water planning authority of these high priority regions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2009, and applies to rulemaking that
begins after that date.

by the board. The minimum amount of the water implementation tax shall be a tax rate times the
adjusted net tax capacity of the county for the preceding year. The rate shall be the rate, rounded
to the nearest .001 of a percent, that, when applied to the adjusted net tax capacity for all counties,
raises the amount of $1,500,000. The base grant will be in an amount equal to $37,500 less the
amount raised by ­h t­­

     Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103C.501, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Cost-sharing funds. (a) The state board shall allocate at least 70 percent of cost-sharing
funds to areas with high priority erosion, sedimentation, or water quality problems or water quantity
problems due to altered hydrology. The areas must be selected based on the statewide priorities
established by the state board. The allocated funds must be used for conservation practices for high
priority problems identified in the comprehensive and annual work plans of the districts.

   (b) The remaining cost-sharing funds may be allocated to districts as follows:
   (1) for technical and administrative assistance, not more than 20 percent of the funds; and
   (2) for conservation practices for lower priority erosion, sedimentation, or water quality
problems.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 103C.501, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Contracts by districts. (a) A district board may contract on a cost-share basis to
furnish financial aid to a land occupier or to a state agency for permanent systems for erosion

consistent with the district's comprehensive and annual work plans.
    (b) The duration of the contract must, at a minimum, be the time required to complete the planned
systems. A contract must specify that the land occupier is liable for monetary damages and penalties
in an amount up to 150 percent of the financial assistance received from the district, for failure
to complete the systems or practices in a timely manner or maintain the systems or practices as
specified in the contract.
    (c) A contract may provide for cooperation or funding with federal agencies. A land occupier or
state agency may provide the cost-sharing portion of the contract through services in kind.
   (d) The state board or the district board may not furnish any financial aid for practices designed
only to increase land productivity.
    (e) When a district board determines that long-term maintenance of a system or practice is
desirable, the board may require that maintenance be made a covenant upon the land for the effective
life of the practice. A covenant under this subdivision shall be construed in the same manner as a
conservation restriction under section 84.65.

    (3) the state or federal government has become titleholder to any of the beds or shores of the
public waters wetlands, subsequent to the preparation of the public waters inventory map filed with
the auditor of the county, pursuant to paragraph (a), and the responsible state or federal agency
declares that the water is necessary for the purposes of the public ownership.
    (c) The commissioner must provide notice of the reclassification to the local government unit,
the county board, the watershed district, if one exists for the area, and the soil and water conservation
district. Within 60 days of receiving notice from the commissioner, a party required to receive
the notice may provide a resolution stating objections to the reclassification. If the commissioner
receives an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the reclassification is not effective.
If the commissioner does not receive an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the
reclassification of a wetland under paragraph (b) is effective 60 days after the notice is received by
all of the parties.
    (d) The commissioner shall give priority to the reclassification of public waters wetlands that
are or have the potential to be affected by public works projects.
   (e) The commissioner may revise the public waters inventory map and list of each county:
   (1) to reflect the changes authorized in paragraph (b); and
   (2) as needed, to:
   (i) correct errors in the original inventory;
    (ii) add or subtract trout stream tributaries within sections that contain a designated trout stream
following written notice to the landowner;
   (iii) add depleted quarries, and sand and gravel pits, when the body of water exceeds 50 acres
and the shoreland has been zoned for residential development; and
   (iv) add or subtract public waters that have been created or eliminated as a requirement of a
permit authorized by the commissioner under section 103G.245.

   (5) protect private aquatic life from unauthorized taking or harvest.
   (b) Private aquatic life that is legally acquired and possessed is an article of interstate commerce
and may be restricted only as necessary to protect state fish and water resources.
    (c) The commissioner of natural resources shall establish license and other fees as provided
in section 16A.1285, subdivision 2, that would make aquaculture licensing and enforcement
self-sustaining. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner may, by written order
published in the State Register, establish the fees required by this section. The fees are not subject
to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The commissioner
shall develop best management practices for aquaculture to ensure the long-term sustainability
of aquaculture and wetlands used for aquaculture, including, but not limited to, fish farming in
man-made ponds.

(1) to (3) and the additional fee required under subdivision 2, paragraph (a). The fees must be set in
an amount that does not recover significantly more or less than the cost of providing the service. The
fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
The services covered under this provision include:
   (1) initial inspection of each water to be licensed;
   (2) fish health inspection and certification, including initial tissue sample collection, basic fish
health assessment, viral pathogen testing, and bacteriological testing; and

notify the affected applicants that their requested locations and time period are subject to a drawing.
After notification, the commissioner shall allow the affected applicants a minimum of seven days

not to a location or time period for which applications are already at or above the limits specified in
subdivisions 7 and 8.
    (c) After the applicants have been given at least seven days to change their applications, the
commissioner shall conduct a drawing for all locations and time periods for which applications
exceed limits. First preference in the drawings shall be given to applicants for established or
traditional fishing contests, and second preference to applicants for contests that are not established
as traditional fishing contests based on the number of times they have been unsuccessful in previous
drawings. Except for applicants of established or traditional fishing contests, an applicant who
is successful in a drawing loses all accumulated preference. "Established or traditional fishing

years for the same lake and time period to remain established or traditional.
    (d) The commissioner has until November 7 to approve or deny permit applications that
are submitted by 4:30 p.m. on the last Friday in September. The commissioner may approve a
permit application that is received after 4:30 p.m. on the last Friday in September if approving the

    Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the outstanding loan balance as projected by
the lender to the anticipated time of payment to the borrower of the final installment of committed
principal shall not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the property at inception of the loan.
If upon reappraisal of the property made at any time during the term of the loan, the projected
outstanding loan balance does not exceed 70 percent of the reappraised value of the property, the
schedule of the lender's installment payments may be extended and the amount of the committed
principal amount increased, provided the revised outstanding loan balance at payment of the lender's
final installment of committed principal does not exceed 80 percent of the reappraised value of the
property.

    (ii) a discussion of the borrower's finances, assets, liabilities, expenses, and income needs and a
review of options other than a reverse mortgage loan that are available to the borrower, including
other housing, social services, health, and financial options;
   (iii) a review of other home equity conversion or other loan options that are or may become
available to the borrower;
    (iv) an explanation of the financial implication of entering into a reverse mortgage loan,
including the costs of the loan;
    (v) an explanation that a reverse mortgage loan may have tax consequences, affect eligibility
for assistance under federal and state programs, and have an impact on the estate and heirs of the
borrower;
   (vi) an explanation of the lending process; and
   (vii) an opportunity for the borrower to ask questions of the counselor.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 47.58, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Lender default; forfeiture. A lender who fails to make loan advances as required in
the loan documents, and fails to cure an actual default after notice as specified in the loan documents,
shall forfeit any right to repayment of the outstanding loan balance with respect to a mortgage that
is not federally insured. Any mortgage that is not federally insured securing a reverse mortgage
agreement in which a forfeiture has occurred pursuant to this subdivision may be declared null and
void by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 47.58, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10. Right of rescission. (a) The borrower may rescind any reverse mortgage within ten
days of execution by providing written notice to the lender. The effects of a rescission shall be
the same as provided in Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation Z, title 12, section 226.23. Any
mortgage originated in connection with a reverse mortgage loan is null and void upon rescission.
Within ten days of receipt of the written notice of rescission, the lender shall provide the borrower a
written notice of acknowledgment that the mortgage is null and void and a satisfaction of mortgage.
    (b) The lender shall provide the borrower with the following notice, which must be on a separate
piece of paper and in at least ten-point type, between 24 to 72 hours prior to execution of the reverse
mortgage:

"You are entitled to rescind (cancel) this reverse mortgage transaction for any reason within ten days
from the day you execute the reverse mortgage documents. The rescission must be in writing and
sent by certified mail to the lender at the address stated in this document."
   (c) Notice of recission is effective when the borrower deposits a certified letter properly
addressed and postage prepaid in the mailbox.
     (d) A notice of rescission given by the borrower need not take a particular form and is sufficient
if it indicates by any form of written expression the intention of the borrower not to be bound by the
reverse mortgage transaction.
      (e) No act of the borrower is effective to waive the right to rescind as provided in this section.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 47.58, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Suitability. Prior to referring a prospective borrower for counseling under subdivision
8, a lender must have reasonable grounds for believing that a reverse mortgage loan is suitable
for the borrower and must make reasonable inquiries to determine suitability. Suitability for a
reverse mortgage loan will be determined by reference to the totality of the particular borrower's
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the borrower's income, age, assets, the costs and
benefits of a reverse mortgage loan, and other financial options available to the borrower.
      Sec. 7. [58.19] REVERSE MORTGAGE LOANS COORDINATION WITH CHAPTER
47.
    No person acting as a residential mortgage originator or servicer, including a person required to
be licensed under this chapter, and no person exempt from the licensing requirements of this chapter
under section 58.04, shall make, provide, or arrange for a reverse mortgage as defined in chapter
47 without complying with that chapter and verifying that the reverse mortgage is suitable for the
borrower.
  Sec. 8. [60K.57] CROSS-SELLING LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE MORTGAGE
PROCEEDS.
    (a) No producer shall sell or encourage the purchase of an annuity, life insurance, or long-term
care insurance product where the producer knows or should know that the purchase will be made
using proceeds from a reverse mortgage.
   (b) This section shall not apply with respect to the purchase of an annuity, life insurance, or
long-term care insurance product made more than 18 months after the date the reverse mortgage
loan was made."

that there is a contribution sufficiency under subdivision 2 equal to or greater than 0.5 percent of
covered payroll for two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution rates for the

within 15 days after the period of accumulation. If reasonable proof is supplied as to only part of
a claim, and the part totals $100 or more, the part is overdue if not paid within the time provided
by this section. Medical or funeral expense benefits may be paid by the reparation obligor directly
to persons supplying products, services, or accommodations to the claimant. Claims by a health
provider defined in section 62J.03, subdivision 8, for medical expense benefits covered by this
chapter shall be submitted to the reparation obligor pursuant to the uniform electronic transaction

55TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, MAY 15, 2009                                      5849

                                                                                     May 15, 2009
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
   I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 1033, Chapter 81, a bill that allows a city, county or
town to manage or control private property which has benefited from public assistance.
    A developer or owner of property who enters into an agreement with a local unit of government
for receipt of public assistance should abide by the terms of the agreement.
   However, this law appears unnecessary. Parties to a development agreement could insert
provisions dealing with the concerns this bill attempts to address in their agreement.
    In its current form, this bill would also allow a city, county or town to more broadly "manage
or control" a property without providing notice in the public assistance agreement that the local
government entity could use the provision of public assistance to invoke such management or
control. At the very least, the bill should require notice in applicable development agreements
regarding the circumstances under which the management or control of the property would occur.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 1033 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 477 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
55TH DAY]                            FRIDAY, MAY 15, 2009                                      5851

   That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 477 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.7411, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Pollution Control Agency. (a) Information held by the commissioner of the Pollution

   Sec. 2. [115A.1331] PAINT STEWARDSHIP PILOT PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) For purposes of sections 115A.1331 to 115A.1333, the following
terms have the meanings given.
   (b) "Architectural paint" means interior and exterior architectural coatings sold in containers of

use.
  (c) "Distributor" means a company that has a contractual relationship with one or more

    Subd. 2. Pilot program. (a) Beginning September 1, 2009, manufacturers of architectural paint
sold at retail must, through a representative organization, implement a statewide paint stewardship
pilot program that minimizes public sector involvement in the management of postconsumer
paint by reducing its generation, promoting its reuse and recycling, and negotiating and executing
agreements to collect, transport, and process postconsumer paint for end-of-life management in an
environmentally sound fashion. In developing the pilot program, manufacturers of architectural
paint must consult with and consider the views of representatives of the Solid Waste Management
Coordinating Board, the Association of Minnesota Counties, the Solid Waste Administrators
Association, and household hazardous waste programs administered in both rural and metropolitan
counties. The pilot program must include a funding mechanism whereby each architectural paint
manufacturer remits to the representative organization payment of the paint stewardship assessment
for each container of architectural paint it sells in this state. The paint stewardship assessment
must be included in the cost of all architectural paint sold to Minnesota retailers and distributors,
5852                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [55TH DAY

and each Minnesota retailer or distributor must include the assessment in the purchase price of all
architectural paint sold in this state.
    (b) To ensure that the funding mechanism is equitable and sustainable, a uniform paint
stewardship assessment must be established for all architectural paint sold. The paint stewardship
assessment may not exceed $0.35 per container of architectural paint. The paint stewardship
assessment must be reviewed by the commissioner and must not exceed the costs of the paint
stewardship pilot program.
    (c) Paint manufacturers or their representative organization shall provide Minnesota consumers
with educational materials regarding the paint stewardship assessment and the paint stewardship
pilot program in a manner designed to ensure that consumers are made aware that a provision for
the operation of a paint stewardship program is included in the purchase price of all architectural
paint sold in the state.
   (d) Paint retailers may participate in the pilot program as paint collection points on a voluntary
basis.
   Sec. 3. [115A.1332] CONDUCT AUTHORIZED.
    A manufacturer or organization of manufacturers that organizes collection, transport, and
processing of postconsumer paint under section 115A.1331 is immune from liability for the conduct
under state laws relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, and other regulation
of trade or commerce only to the extent that the conduct is necessary to plan and implement its
chosen organized collection or recycling system.
   Sec. 4. [115A.1333] REPORTS.
    (a) On October 15, 2010, manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail in this state must,
through a representative organization, submit a report to the commissioner describing the paint
stewardship pilot program. At a minimum, the report must contain:

evaluation of the methods used to disseminate those materials; and
   (7) an analysis of the environmental costs and benefits of collecting and recycling latex paint.
  (b) Data reported to the commissioner by a manufacturer or the representative organization of
manufacturers is classified as nonpublic data, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, except
55TH DAY]                             FRIDAY, MAY 15, 2009                                      5853

that the commissioner may release the data in summary form in which individual manufacturers,
distributors, or retailers are not identified and from which neither their identities nor any other
characteristics that could uniquely identify an individual manufacturer or retailer are ascertainable.
    (c) By January 15, 2012, the commissioner shall submit a report to the chairs and ranking
minority members of the committees in the senate and house of representatives that have primary
jurisdiction over solid waste policy describing the results of the paint stewardship pilot program
and recommending whether it should be made permanent and any modifications to improve
its functioning and efficiency. In preparing the report, the commissioner must consult with
representatives of the Solid Waste Management Coordinating Board, the Association of Minnesota
Counties, the Solid Waste Administrators Association, and household hazardous waste programs
administered in both rural and metropolitan counties, and must include their views in the report.
The report must include an estimate of the savings to state and local units of government compared
with the costs of the program.
    Sec. 5. [115A.1334] EXPIRATION.
    Sections 115A.1331 to 115A.1334 expire June 30, 2012.

    Subd. 2. Order; notice. (a) If in any city a building becomes vacant or unoccupied and is deemed
hazardous due to the fact that the building is open to trespass and has not been secured and the
building could be made safe by securing the building, the governing body may order the building
secured and shall cause notice of the order to be served upon the owner of record of the premises or

mortgage or sheriff's certificate, and any neighborhood association for the neighborhood in which the
building is located that has requested notice, by delivering or mailing a copy to the owner or agent,

the identified taxpayer, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate, and the neighborhood
association, at the last known address. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.
   (b) The notice under this subdivision must include a statement that:
    (1) informs the owner and the holder of any mortgage or sheriff's certificate of the requirements
of subdivision 3 and that costs may be assessed against the property if the person does not secure
the building;
    (2) informs the owner and the holder of any mortgage or sheriff's certificate that the person may
request a hearing before the governing body challenging the governing body's determination that
the property is vacant or unoccupied and hazardous; and
     (3) notifies the holder of any sheriff's certificate of the holder's duty under section 582.031,
subdivision 1, paragraph (b), to enter the premises to protect the premises from waste and trespass
if the order is not challenged or set aside and there is prima facie evidence of abandonment of the
property as described in section 582.032, subdivision 7.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 463.251, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Securing building by city; lien. If the owner of the building or a holder of the sheriff's
certificate of sale fails to either comply or provide to the governing body a reasonable plan and
schedule to comply with an order issued under subdivision 2 or to request a hearing on the order
within ­s­x
         i­ 14 days after the order is served, the governing body shall cause the building to be properly
secured and the cost of securing the building may be charged against the real estate as provided in
section 463.21. In the metropolitan area, as defined in section 473.121, subdivision 2, the governing
body may work with neighborhood associations to develop and implement plans to secure vacant
buildings in a timely and cost-effective fashion. The city may use rehabilitation and revitalization
funds in implementing this section.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.151, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Limitation on lease and notice to tenant. (a) Once a landlord has received notice
of a contract for deed cancellation under section 559.21 or notice of a mortgage foreclosure sale
under chapter 580 or 582, or summons and complaint under chapter 581, the landlord may only
enter into (i) a periodic residential lease agreement with a term of not more than two months or the
time remaining in the contract cancellation period or the mortgagor's redemption period, whichever
is less or (ii) a fixed term residential tenancy not extending beyond the cancellation period or the
landlord's period of redemption until:
   (1) the contract for deed has been reinstated or paid in full;
   (2) the mortgage default has been cured and the mortgage reinstated;
   (3) the mortgage has been satisfied;
   (4) the property has been redeemed from a foreclosure sale; or
   (5) a receiver has been appointed.
    (b) Before entering into a lease under this section and accepting any rent or security deposit from
a tenant, the landlord must notify the prospective tenant in writing that the landlord has received
5856                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [55TH DAY

notice of a contract for deed cancellation or notice of a mortgage foreclosure sale as appropriate,
and the date on which the contract cancellation period or the mortgagor's redemption period ends.
   (c) This section does not apply to a manufactured home park as defined in section 327C.01,
subdivision 5.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2009, and applies to leases entered
into on or after that date.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.178, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Withholding rent. No tenant may withhold payment of all or any portion of rent for
the last payment period of a residential rental agreement, except an oral or written month to month
residential rental agreement concerning which neither the tenant nor landlord has served a notice
to quit, or for the last month of a contract for deed cancellation period under section 559.21 or a
mortgage foreclosure redemption period under chapter 580, 581, or 582, on the grounds that the
deposit should serve as payment for the rent. Withholding all or any portion of rent for the last
payment period of the residential rental agreement creates a rebuttable presumption that the tenant
withheld the last payment on the grounds that the deposit should serve as payment for the rent.
Any tenant who remains in violation of this subdivision after written demand and notice of this
subdivision shall be liable to the landlord for the following:
   (1) a penalty in an amount equal to the portion of the deposit which the landlord is entitled to
withhold under subdivision 3 other than to remedy the tenant's default in the payment of rent; and
   (2) interest on the whole deposit as provided in subdivision 2, in addition to the amount of rent
withheld by the tenant in violation of this subdivision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2009, and applies to cancellations of
contracts for deed in which the notice of cancellation is first served or published on or after August
1, 2009, and mortgage foreclosures under chapter 581 in which the lis pendens is recorded on or
after August 1, 2009.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 580.021, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies to foreclosure of mortgages by advertisement
under this chapter and foreclosure of mortgages by action under chapter 581 on property consisting
of one to four family dwelling units, one of which the owner occupies as the owner's principal place
of residency ­on

from waste and trespass, until the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate receives notice that
the premises are occupied. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate does not become a
mortgagee in possession by taking actions authorized or required under this section. An affidavit of
the sheriff, the building or housing regulatory authority of a municipality in which the property is
located, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate, or a person acting on behalf of the holder,
describing the premises and stating that the same are vacant or unoccupied, is prima facie evidence
of the facts stated in the affidavit and is entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder or
the registrar of titles in the county where the premises are located, if it contains a legal description
of the premises.
    (b) If the holder of a sheriff's certificate knows that there is prima facie evidence of abandonment
of the property, as described in section 582.032, subdivision 7, clauses (1) to (6), the holder or the
holder's agents:
    (1) shall enter the premises and make reasonable periodic inspections, install or change the locks
on all doors, install locks on all windows that do not have locks, and ensure that any existing window
locks are functioning properly; and
    (2) may, to protect the premises from waste, trespass, or falling below minimum community
standards for public safety and sanitation, enter the premises and board windows, doors, and other
openings; install and operate an alarm system; and otherwise prevent or minimize damage to the
premises from the elements, vandalism, trespass, or other illegal activity.
    (c) Upon an installation or change of locks as required by this section, the holder of a sheriff's
certificate must deliver a key to the premises to the mortgagor or any person lawfully claiming
through the mortgagor, upon request.
    Subd. 2. Authorized actions. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate may take the
following actions to protect the premises from waste, trespass, or from falling below minimum
community standards for public safety and sanitation: make reasonable periodic inspections,  ­; install
or change locks on doors and windows,     ­; board windows, doors, and other openings; install and
operate an alarm system,   ­; and otherwise prevent or minimize damage to the premises from the
elements, vandalism, trespass, or other illegal activities. If the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's
certificate installs or changes locks under this section, a key to the premises must be promptly
delivered to the mortgagor or any person lawfully claiming through the mortgagor, upon request.
    Subd. 3. Costs. All costs incurred by the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate to protect
the premises from waste or trespass or from falling below minimum community standards for public
safety and sanitation may be added to the principal balance of the mortgage or the costs allowable
upon redemption. The costs may bear interest to the extent provided in the mortgage and may be
added to the redemption price if the costs are incurred after a foreclosure sale. If the costs are incurred
after a foreclosure sale, the holder of any sheriff's certificate of sale or certificate of redemption must
comply with the provisions of section 582.03. The provisions of this section are in addition to, and
do not limit or replace, any other rights or remedies available to holders of mortgages and sheriff's
certificates, at law or under the applicable mortgage agreements.

     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 582.032, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Before foreclosure sale. Notwithstanding section 580.23 or 581.10, if at any time
before the foreclosure sale but not more than 30 days before the first publication of the notice
of sale, a court order is entered reducing the mortgagor's redemption period to five weeks under
subdivision 7, after the mortgaged premises have been sold as provided in chapter 580 or 581, the
mortgagor, and the mortgagor's personal representatives or assigns, within five weeks after the sale
under chapter 580, or within five weeks after the date of the order confirming the sale under chapter
581, may redeem the mortgaged premises as provided in section 580.23, subdivision 1, or 581.10,
as applicable. ­    I­f­­

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2009, and applies to foreclosures for
which the notice of sale is first published on or after that date.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 582.032, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Summons and complaint. In a foreclosure by advertisement, the party foreclosing
a mortgage or holding the sheriff's certificate of sale or the political subdivision in which the
mortgaged premises are located may initiate a proceeding in district court to reduce the mortgagor's
redemption period under this section. The proceeding must be initiated by the filing of a complaint,
naming the mortgagor, or the mortgagor's personal representatives or assigns of record, as
defendant, in district court for the county in which the mortgaged premises are located. If the
proceeding is initiated by a political subdivision, the party foreclosing the mortgage or holding the
sheriff's certificate of sale must also be named as a defendant, and the summons and complaint shall
be delivered by certified mail to the foreclosing attorney. If the proceeding is commenced after
the foreclosure sale, the holders of junior liens and interests entitled to notice under subdivision 3
must also be named as defendants. The complaint must identify the mortgaged premises by legal
description and must identify the mortgage by the names of the mortgagor and mortgagee, and
any assignee of the mortgagee; the date of its making; and pertinent recording information. The
complaint must allege that the mortgaged premises are:
     (1) ten acres or less in size;
   (2) improved with a residential dwelling consisting of less than five units, which is not a model
home or a dwelling under construction;
     (3) not property used in agricultural production; and
     (4) abandoned.
    The complaint must request an order reducing the mortgagor's redemption period to five weeks.
When the complaint has been filed, the court shall issue a summons commanding the person or
persons named in the complaint to appear before the court on a day and at a place stated in the
summons. The appearance date shall be not less than 15 nor more than 25 days from the date of the
issuing of the summons. A copy of the filed complaint must be attached to the summons.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 582.032, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

sheriff's certificate may make a motion to reduce the mortgagor's redemption period under this
section. The political subdivision in which the mortgaged premises are located may intervene in
the action and make a motion to reduce the redemption period. The motion must conform generally
to the pleading requirements provided in subdivision 4. For purposes of the motion, the court has
continuing jurisdiction over the parties and the mortgaged premises through the expiration of the
redemption period. When the motion has been filed, the court shall issue an order to show cause
commanding the parties it considers appropriate to appear before the court on a day and at a place
stated in the order. The appearance date may not be less than 15 nor more than 25 days after the date
of the order to show cause. A copy of the motion must be attached to the order to show cause.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 582.032, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Hearing; evidence; order. At the hearing on the summons and complaint or order to
show cause, the court shall enter an order reducing the mortgagor's redemption period as provided in
subdivision 2 or 3, as applicable, if evidence is presented supporting the allegations in the complaint
or motion and no appearance is made to oppose the relief sought. An affidavit by the sheriff or a
deputy sheriff of the county in which the mortgaged premises are located, or of a building inspector,
zoning administrator, housing official, or other municipal or county official having jurisdiction over
the mortgaged premises, stating that the mortgaged premises are not actually occupied and further
setting forth any of the following supporting facts, is prima facie evidence of abandonment:
    (1) windows or entrances to the premises are boarded up or closed off, or multiple window panes
are broken and unrepaired;
   (2) doors to the premises are smashed through, broken off, unhinged, or continuously unlocked;
   (3) gas, electric, or water service to the premises has been terminated;
   (4) rubbish, trash, or debris has accumulated on the mortgaged premises;
    (5) the police or sheriff's office has received at least two reports of trespassers on the premises,
or of vandalism or other illegal acts being committed on the premises; or
   (6) the premises are deteriorating and are either below or are in imminent danger of falling below
minimum community standards for public safety and sanitation.
    An affidavit of the party foreclosing the mortgage or holding the sheriff's certificate, or one
of their agents or contractors, stating any of the above supporting facts, and that the affiant has
changed locks on the mortgaged premises under section 582.031 and that for a period of ten days
no party having a legal possessory right has requested entrance to the premises, is also prima facie
evidence of abandonment. Either affidavit described above, or an affidavit from any other person
having knowledge, may state facts supporting any other allegations in the complaint or motion and
is prima facie evidence of the same. Written statements of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal
representatives or assigns, including documents of conveyance, which indicate a clear intent to
abandon the premises, are conclusive evidence of abandonment. In the absence of affidavits or
written statements, or if rebuttal evidence is offered by the defendant or a party lawfully claiming
through the defendant, the court may consider any competent evidence, including oral testimony,
concerning any allegation in the complaint or motion. A defendant's failure to appear at the hearing
after service of process in compliance with subdivision 6 is conclusive evidence of abandonment
by the defendant, subject to vacation under Rule 60.02 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure.
