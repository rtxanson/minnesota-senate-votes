persons who have applied for and received an instruction permit under subdivision 2.
    (b) The permit holder may, with the permit in possession, operate a motor vehicle, but must be

sole purpose of obtaining emergency assistance to prevent a crime about to be committed, or in the
reasonable belief that a person's life or safety was in danger. Violation of this paragraph is a petty
misdemeanor subject to section 169.89, subdivision 2.

section 169A.20, 169A.33, 169A.35, or sections 169A.50 to 169A.53. If the permit holder drives a
motor vehicle in violation of the law, the commissioner shall suspend, cancel, or revoke the permit
in accordance with the statutory section violated.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 171.055, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Use of provisional license. (a) A provisional license holder may operate a motor vehicle
only when every occupant under the age of 18 has a seat belt or child passenger restraint system
properly fastened. A person who violates this paragraph is subject to a fine of $25. A peace officer
may not issue a citation for a violation of this paragraph unless the officer lawfully stopped or
detained the driver of the motor vehicle for a moving violation as defined in section 171.04. The
commissioner shall not record a violation of this paragraph on a person's driving record.
    (b) A provisional license holder may not operate a vehicle while communicating over, or
otherwise operating, a cellular or wireless telephone, whether handheld or hands free, when the
vehicle is in motion. The provisional license holder may assert as an affirmative defense that the
violation was made for the sole purpose of obtaining emergency assistance to prevent a crime about
to be committed, or in the reasonable belief that a person's life or safety was in danger. Violation of
this paragraph is a petty misdemeanor subject to section 169.89, subdivision 2.
    
    (b
     ) (c) If the holder of a provisional license during the period of provisional licensing incurs (1) a
conviction for a violation of section 169A.20, 169A.33, 169A.35, or sections 169A.50 to 169A.53,
(2) a conviction for a crash-related moving violation, or (3) more than one conviction for a moving
violation that is not crash related, the person may not be issued a driver's license until 12 consecutive
months have expired since the date of the conviction or until the person reaches the age of 18 years,
whichever occurs first.

    () (d) For the first six months of provisional licensure, a provisional license holder may not
     c
operate a motor vehicle carrying more than one passenger under the age of 20 years who is not a
member of the holder's immediate family. For the second six months, the holder of the license may
not operate a motor vehicle that is carrying more than three passengers who are under the age of 20
years and who are not members of the holder's immediate family. This paragraph does not apply if
the provisional license holder is accompanied by a parent or guardian.
   
   (d
    ) (e) For the first six months of provisional licensure, a provisional license holder may operate
a motor vehicle between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m. only when the license holder is:

   (2) driving between the license holder's home and a school event for which the school has not
provided transportation;

   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
   Senator Ortman moved to amend S.F. No. 2437 as follows:
   Page 2, after line 9, insert:
   "Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings given
them:
   (a) "Domestic abuse" means the following, if committed against a family or household member
by a family or household member:
   (1) physical harm, bodily injury, or assault;
   (2) the infliction of fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault; 
                                                                                    or
    (3) terroristic threats, within the meaning of section 609.713, subdivision 1; criminal sexual
conduct, within the meaning of section 609.342, 609.343, 609.344, 609.345, or 609.3451; or
interference with an emergency call within the meaning of section 609.78, subdivision 2; or
   (4) using or threatening to use any form of domination or control for the purpose of causing a
family or household member to obtain an unwanted medical procedure.
   (b) "Family or household members" means:
   (1) spouses and former spouses;
   (2) parents and children;
   (3) persons related by blood;
   (4) persons who are presently residing together or who have resided together in the past;
    (5) persons who have a child in common regardless of whether they have been married or have
lived together at any time;
   (6) a man and woman if the woman is pregnant and the man is alleged to be the father, regardless
of whether they have been married or have lived together at any time; and
   (7) persons involved in a significant romantic or sexual relationship.
     Issuance of an order for protection on the ground in clause (6) does not affect a determination of
paternity under sections 257.51 to 257.74. In determining whether persons are or have been involved
in a significant romantic or sexual relationship under clause (7), the court shall consider the length
of time of the relationship; type of relationship; frequency of interaction between the parties; and,
if the relationship has terminated, length of time since the termination.
   (c) "Qualified domestic violence-related offense" has the meaning given in section 609.02,
subdivision 16."

acceptance or a written counteroffer within 30 days. After that time, interest on the judgment or
award shall be calculated by the judge or arbitrator in the following manner. The prevailing party
shall receive interest on any judgment or award from the time of commencement of the action
or a demand for arbitration, or the time of a written notice of claim, or as to special damages
from the time when special damages were incurred, if later, until the time of verdict, award, or
report only if the amount of its offer is closer to the judgment or award than the amount of the
opposing party's offer. If the amount of the losing party's offer was closer to the judgment or award
than the prevailing party's offer, the prevailing party shall receive interest only on the amount
of the settlement offer or the judgment or award, whichever is less, and only from the time of
commencement of the action or a demand for arbitration, or the time of a written notice of claim,
or as to special damages from when the special damages were incurred, if later, until the time
the settlement offer was made. Subsequent offers and counteroffers supersede the legal effect of
earlier offers and counteroffers. For the purposes of clause (2), the amount of settlement offer
must be allocated between past and future damages in the same proportion as determined by the
trier of fact. Except as otherwise provided by contract or allowed by law, preverdict, preaward, or
prereport interest shall not be awarded on the following:
    (1) judgments, awards, or benefits in workers' compensation cases, but not including third-party
actions;
    (2) judgments or awards for future damages;
    (3) punitive damages, fines, or other damages that are noncompensatory in nature;
    (4) judgments or awards not in excess of the amount specified in section 491A.01; and
    (5) that portion of any verdict, award, or report which is founded upon interest, or costs,
disbursements, attorney fees, or other similar items added by the court or arbitrator.

interest per annum. The rate of interest shall be based on the secondary market yield of one year
United States Treasury bills, calculated on a bank discount basis as provided in this section.
    On or before the 20th day of December of each year the state court administrator shall determine
the rate from the one-year constant maturity treasury yield for the most recent calendar month,
reported on a monthly basis in the latest statistical release of the board of governors of the Federal
Reserve System. This yield, rounded to the nearest one percent, or four percent, whichever is greater,
shall be the annual interest rate during the succeeding calendar year. The state court administrator
shall communicate the interest rates to the court administrators and sheriffs for use in computing
the interest on verdicts and shall make the interest rates available to arbitrators.
