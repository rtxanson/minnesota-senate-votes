       Sec. 14. AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE HEALTH PLAN FOR FARMERS.
    Subdivision 1. Pilot project requirements. Notwithstanding contrary provisions of Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 62H, the following apply to a joint self-insurance pilot project administered by
a trust sponsored by one or more agricultural cooperatives organized under Minnesota Statutes,
chapter 308A or 308B, or under a federal charter for the purpose of offering health coverage to
members of the cooperatives and their families, provided the project satisfies the other requirements
of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 62H:
   (1) Minnesota Statutes, section 62H.02, paragraph (b), does not apply;
   (2) the notice period required under Minnesota Statutes, section 62H.02, paragraph (e), is 90
days;
    (3) a joint self-insurance plan may elect to treat the sale of a health plan to or for an employer
that has only one eligible employee who has not waived coverage as the sale of an individual health
plan as allowed under Minnesota Statutes, section 62L.02, subdivision 26;
   (4) Minnesota Statutes, section 297I.05, subdivision 12, paragraph (c), applies; and
   (5) the trust must pay the assessment for the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association as
provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 62E.11.
     Subd. 2. Evaluation and renewal. The pilot project authorized under this section is for a period
of four years from the date of initial enrollment. The commissioner of commerce shall grant an
extension of four additional years if the trust provides evidence that it remains in compliance with
the requirements of this section and other applicable laws and rules. If the commissioner determines
that the operation of the trust has not improved access, expanded health plan choices, or improved
the affordability of health coverage for farm families, or that it has significantly damaged access,
choice, or affordability for other consumers not enrolled in the trust, the commissioner shall provide
at least 180 days' advance written notice to the trust and to the chairs of the senate and house finance
and policy committees with jurisdiction over health and insurance of the commissioner's intention
not to renew the pilot project at the expiration of a four-year period.
     Subd. 3. Use of surplus lines. Plans created under this section may use surplus lines carriers to
fulfill its obligations under chapter 62H."
   Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
   Amend the title accordingly
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.

     Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 10A.20, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Third-party reimbursement. An individual or association filing a report disclosing
an expenditure or noncampaign disbursement that must be reported and itemized under subdivision
3, paragraph (g) or (l), that is a reimbursement to a third party must report the purpose of each
expenditure or disbursement for which the third party is being reimbursed. In the alternative, the

goods or services that were not directly provided by the individual or association to whom the
expenditure or disbursement is made. Third-party reimbursements include payments to credit card
companies and reimbursement of individuals for expenses they have incurred.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2935 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate concur in the House amendment and that S.F. No. 2935 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
                                            "ARTICLE 1
                                            LICENSING
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144A.071, subdivision 4c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4c. Exceptions for replacement beds after June 30, 2003. (a) The commissioner of
health, in coordination with the commissioner of human services, may approve the renovation,
replacement, upgrading, or relocation of a nursing home or boarding care home, under the following
conditions:
    (1) to license and certify an 80-bed city-owned facility in Nicollet County to be constructed on
the site of a new city-owned hospital to replace an existing 85-bed facility attached to a hospital that
is also being replaced. The threshold allowed for this project under section 144A.073 shall be the
maximum amount available to pay the additional medical assistance costs of the new facility;
    (2) to license and certify 29 beds to be added to an existing 69-bed facility in St. Louis County,
provided that the 29 beds must be transferred from active or layaway status at an existing facility in
St. Louis County that had 235 beds on April 1, 2003.
98TH DAY]                             THURSDAY, MAY 6, 2010                                          10563

The licensed capacity at the 235-bed facility must be reduced to 206 beds, but the payment rate at
that facility shall not be adjusted as a result of this transfer. The operating payment rate of the facility
adding beds after completion of this project shall be the same as it was on the day prior to the day
the beds are licensed and certified. This project shall not proceed unless it is approved and financed
under the provisions of section 144A.073;
    (3) to license and certify a new 60-bed facility in Austin, provided that: (i) 45 of the new beds
are transferred from a 45-bed facility in Austin under common ownership that is closed and 15 of
the new beds are transferred from a 182-bed facility in Albert Lea under common ownership; (ii) the
commissioner of human services is authorized by the 2004 legislature to negotiate budget-neutral
planned nursing facility closures; and (iii) money is available from planned closures of facilities
under common ownership to make implementation of this clause budget-neutral to the state. The
bed capacity of the Albert Lea facility shall be reduced to 167 beds following the transfer. Of the 60
beds at the new facility, 20 beds shall be used for a special care unit for persons with Alzheimer's
disease or related dementias;
    (4) to license and certify up to 80 beds transferred from an existing state-owned nursing
facility in Cass County to a new facility located on the grounds of the Ah-Gwah-Ching campus.
The operating cost payment rates for the new facility shall be determined based on the interim
and settle-up payment provisions of Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0057, and the reimbursement
provisions of section 256B.431. The property payment rate for the first three years of operation
shall be $35 per day. For subsequent years, the property payment rate of $35 per day shall be
adjusted for inflation as provided in section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), as long as the
facility has a contract under section 256B.434; ­an
                                                  ­­d
    (5) to initiate a pilot program to license and certify up to 80 beds transferred from an existing
county-owned nursing facility in Steele County relocated to the site of a new acute care facility as
part of the county's Communities for a Lifetime comprehensive plan to create innovative responses
to the aging of its population. Upon relocation to the new site, the nursing facility shall delicense
28 beds. The property payment rate for the first three years of operation of the new facility shall be
increased by an amount as calculated according to items (i) to (v):
    (i) compute the estimated decrease in medical assistance residents served by the nursing facility
by multiplying the decrease in licensed beds by the historical percentage of medical assistance
resident days;
    (ii) compute the annual savings to the medical assistance program from the delicensure of 28
beds by multiplying the anticipated decrease in medical assistance residents, determined in item (i),
by the existing facility's weighted average payment rate multiplied by 365;
     (iii) compute the anticipated annual costs for community-based services by multiplying the
anticipated decrease in medical assistance residents served by the nursing facility, determined in item
(i), by the average monthly elderly waiver service costs for individuals in Steele County multiplied
by 12;
   (iv) subtract the amount in item (iii) from the amount in item (ii);
   (v) divide the amount in item (iv) by an amount equal to the relocated nursing facility's
occupancy factor under section 256B.431, subdivision 3f, paragraph (c), multiplied by the historical
percentage of medical assistance resident days.

   For subsequent years, the adjusted property payment rate shall be adjusted for inflation as
provided in section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), as long as the facility has a contract
under section 256B.434.­; and
    (6) to consolidate and relocate nursing facility beds to a new site in Goodhue County and to
integrate these services with other community-based programs and services under a communities

relocation of an existing 84-bed, hospital-owned nursing facility and the entire closure or downsizing
of beds from a 65-bed nonprofit nursing facility in the community resulting in the delicensure of
69 beds in the two existing facilities. Notwithstanding the carryforward of the approval authority
in section 144A.073, subdivision 11, the funding approved in April 2009 by the commissioner of
health for a project in Goodhue County shall not carry forward. The closure of the 69 beds shall not
be eligible for a planned closure rate adjustment under section 256B.437. The construction project
permitted in this clause shall not be eligible for a threshold project rate adjustment under section
256B.434, subdivision 4f. The property payment rate for the first three years of operation of the new
facility shall be increased by an amount as calculated according to items (i) to (vi):
    (i) compute the estimated decrease in medical assistance residents served by both nursing
facilities by multiplying the difference between the occupied beds of the two nursing facilities for
the reporting year ending September 30, 2009, and the projected occupancy of the facility at 95
percent occupancy by the historical percentage of medical assistance resident days;
    (ii) compute the annual savings to the medical assistance program from the delicensure by
multiplying the anticipated decrease in the medical assistance residents, determined in item (i), by
the hospital-owned nursing facility weighted average payment rate multiplied by 365;
    (iii) compute the anticipated annual costs for community-based services by multiplying the
anticipated decrease in medical assistance residents served by the facilities, determined in item (i),
by the average monthly elderly waiver service costs for individuals in Goodhue County multiplied
by 12;
   (iv) subtract the amount in item (iii) from the amount in item (ii);
   (v) multiply the amount in item (iv) by 48.5 percent; and
   (vi) divide the difference of the amount in item (iv) and the amount in item (v) by an amount
equal to the relocated nursing facility's occupancy factor under section 256B.431, subdivision 3f,
paragraph (c), multiplied by the historical percentage of medical assistance resident days.
   For subsequent years, the adjusted property payment rate shall be adjusted for inflation as
provided in section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), as long as the facility has a contract
under section 256B.434.
   (b) Projects approved under this subdivision shall be treated in a manner equivalent to projects
approved under subdivision 4a.

licensing inspection, or investigating an alleged violation of applicable laws or rules. In conducting
inspections, the commissioner may request and shall receive assistance from other state, county,
and municipal governmental agencies and departments. The applicant or license holder shall allow
the commissioner to photocopy, photograph, and make audio and video tape recordings during the
inspection of the program at the commissioner's expense. The commissioner shall obtain a court

order or the consent of the subject of the records or the parents or legal guardian of the subject
before photocopying hospital medical records.
   Persons served by the program have the right to refuse to consent to be interviewed,
photographed, or audio or videotaped. Failure or refusal of an applicant or license holder to fully
comply with this subdivision is reasonable cause for the commissioner to deny the application or
immediately suspend or revoke the license.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245A.04, subdivision 7, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 7. Grant of license; license extension. (a) If the commissioner determines that the
program complies with all applicable rules and laws, the commissioner shall issue a license. At
minimum, the license shall state:
   (1) the name of the license holder;
   (2) the address of the program;
   (3) the effective date and expiration date of the license;
   (4) the type of license;
   (5) the maximum number and ages of persons that may receive services from the program; and
   (6) any special conditions of licensure.
   (b) The commissioner may issue an initial license for a period not to exceed two years if:
    (1) the commissioner is unable to conduct the evaluation or observation required by subdivision
4, paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), because the program is not yet operational;
   (2) certain records and documents are not available because persons are not yet receiving services
from the program; and
   (3) the applicant complies with applicable laws and rules in all other respects.
   (c) A decision by the commissioner to issue a license does not guarantee that any person or
persons will be placed or cared for in the licensed program. A license shall not be transferable
to another individual, corporation, partnership, voluntary association, other organization, or
controlling individual or to another location.
  (d) A license holder must notify the commissioner and obtain the commissioner's approval before
making any changes that would alter the license information listed under paragraph (a).
    (e) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h), the commissioner shall not issue or reissue a
license if the applicant, license holder, or controlling individual has:
   (1) been disqualified and the disqualification was not set aside and no variance has been granted;
   (2) has been denied a license within the past two years;
   (3) had a license revoked within the past five years; or
98TH DAY]                            THURSDAY, MAY 6, 2010                                         10569

   (4) has an outstanding debt related to a license fee, licensing fine, or settlement agreement for
which payment is delinquent.
   When a license is revoked under clause (1) or (3), the license holder and controlling individual
may not hold any license under chapter 245A or 245B for five years following the revocation, and
other licenses held by the applicant, license holder, or controlling individual shall also be revoked.
   (f) The commissioner shall not issue or reissue a license if an individual living in the household
where the licensed services will be provided as specified under section 245C.03, subdivision 1, has
been disqualified and the disqualification has not been set aside and no variance has been granted.
    (g) Pursuant to section 245A.07, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), when a license has been suspended
or revoked and the suspension or revocation is under appeal, the program may continue to operate
pending a final order from the commissioner. If the license under suspension or revocation will
expire before a final order is issued, a temporary provisional license may be issued provided any
applicable license fee is paid before the temporary provisional license is issued.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (g), when a revocation is based on the disqualification of a
controlling individual or license holder, and the controlling individual or license holder is ordered
under section 245C.17 to be immediately removed from direct contact with persons receiving
services or is ordered to be under continuous, direct supervision when providing direct contact
services, the program may continue to operate only if the program complies with the order and
submits documentation demonstrating compliance with the order. If the disqualified individual
fails to submit a timely request for reconsideration, or if the disqualification is not set aside and no
variance is granted, the order to immediately remove the individual from direct contact or to be
under continuous, direct supervision remains in effect pending the outcome of a hearing and final
order from the commissioner.

Program, Code of Federal Regulations, title 7, subtitle B, chapter II, subchapter A, part 226,
relocation within the same county by a licensed family day care provider, shall be considered an
extension of the license for a period of no more than 30 calendar days or until the new license is
issued, whichever occurs first, provided the county agency has determined the family day care
provider meets licensure requirements at the new location.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (j) Unless otherwise specified by statute, all licenses expire at 12:01 a.m. on the day after the
expiration date stated on the license. A license holder must apply for and be granted a new license
to operate the program or the program must not be operated after the expiration date.
    (k) The commissioner shall not issue or reissue a license if it has been determined that a tribal
licensing authority has established jurisdiction to license the program or service.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245A.07, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Sanctions; appeals; license. (a) In addition to making a license conditional under
section 245A.06, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the license, impose a fine, or secure
an injunction against the continuing operation of the program of a license holder who does not
comply with applicable law or rule. When applying sanctions authorized under this section, the

commissioner shall consider the nature, chronicity, or severity of the violation of law or rule and
the effect of the violation on the health, safety, or rights of persons served by the program.

the date the final order is issued. If the license holder prevails on the appeal, a new nonprovisional
license shall be issued for the remainder of the current license period.
    (c) If a license holder is under investigation and the license is due to expire before completion
of the investigation, the program shall be issued a new license upon completion of the reapplication
requirements and payment of any applicable license fee. Upon completion of the investigation, a
licensing sanction may be imposed against the new license under this section, section 245A.06, or
245A.08.
    (d) Failure to reapply or closure of a license by the license holder prior to the completion of
any investigation shall not preclude the commissioner from issuing a licensing sanction under this
section, section 245A.06, or 245A.08 at the conclusion of the investigation.
      Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.07, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Immediate suspension expedited hearing. (a) Within five working days of receipt of
the license holder's timely appeal, the commissioner shall request assignment of an administrative
law judge. The request must include a proposed date, time, and place of a hearing. A hearing must
be conducted by an administrative law judge within 30 calendar days of the request for assignment,
unless an extension is requested by either party and granted by the administrative law judge for
good cause. The commissioner shall issue a notice of hearing by certified mail or personal service
at least ten working days before the hearing. The scope of the hearing shall be limited solely to
the issue of whether the temporary immediate suspension should remain in effect pending the
commissioner's final order under section 245A.08, regarding a licensing sanction issued under
subdivision 3 following the immediate suspension. The burden of proof in expedited hearings
under this subdivision shall be limited to the commissioner's demonstration that reasonable cause
exists to believe that the license holder's actions or failure to comply with applicable law or rule
poses, or if the actions of other individuals or conditions in the program poses an imminent risk
of harm to the health, safety, or rights of persons served by the program. "Reasonable cause"
means there exist specific articulable facts or circumstances which provide the commissioner with
a reasonable suspicion that there is an imminent risk of harm to the health, safety, or rights of
persons served by the program.

    (b) The administrative law judge shall issue findings of fact, conclusions, and a recommendation
within ten working days from the date of hearing. The parties shall have ten calendar days to
submit exceptions to the administrative law judge's report. The record shall close at the end of the
ten-day period for submission of exceptions. The commissioner's final order shall be issued within
ten working days from the close of the record. Within 90 calendar days after a final order affirming
an immediate suspension, the commissioner shall make a determination regarding whether a final
licensing sanction shall be issued under subdivision 3. The license holder shall continue to be
prohibited from operation of the program during this 90-day period.
    (c) When the final order under paragraph (b) affirms an immediate suspension, and a final
licensing sanction is issued under subdivision 3 and the license holder appeals that sanction,
the license holder continues to be prohibited from operation of the program pending a final
commissioner's order under section 245A.08, subdivision 5, regarding the final licensing sanction.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. License suspension, revocation, or fine. (a) The commissioner may suspend or revoke
a license, or impose a fine if a license holder fails to comply fully with applicable laws or rules, if a
license holder, a controlling individual, or an individual living in the household where the licensed
services are provided or is otherwise subject to a background study has a disqualification which
has not been set aside under section 245C.22, or if a license holder knowingly withholds relevant
information from or gives false or misleading information to the commissioner in connection with
an application for a license, in connection with the background study status of an individual, during
an investigation, or regarding compliance with applicable laws or rules. A license holder who has
had a license suspended, revoked, or has been ordered to pay a fine must be given notice of the action
by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address shown on
the application or the last known address of the license holder. The notice must state the reasons the
license was suspended, revoked, or a fine was ordered.
    (b) If the license was suspended or revoked, the notice must inform the license holder of the right
to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612.
The license holder may appeal an order suspending or revoking a license. The appeal of an order
suspending or revoking a license must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If
mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder receives notice that the license has been suspended or revoked. If a request is
made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder received the order. Except as provided in subdivision 2a, paragraph (c), if a license
holder submits a timely appeal of an order suspending or revoking a license, the license holder may
continue to operate the program as provided in section 245A.04, subdivision 7, paragraphs (g) and
(h), until the commissioner issues a final order on the suspension or revocation.
    (c)(1) If the license holder was ordered to pay a fine, the notice must inform the license holder of
the responsibility for payment of fines and the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and
Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The appeal of an order to pay a fine must be made
in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent
to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder receives notice that the fine

has been ordered. If a request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner
within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order.
    (2) The license holder shall pay the fines assessed on or before the payment date specified. If
the license holder fails to fully comply with the order, the commissioner may issue a second fine
or suspend the license until the license holder complies. If the license holder receives state funds,
the state, county, or municipal agencies or departments responsible for administering the funds shall
withhold payments and recover any payments made while the license is suspended for failure to pay
a fine. A timely appeal shall stay payment of the fine until the commissioner issues a final order.
    (3) A license holder shall promptly notify the commissioner of human services, in writing, when
a violation specified in the order to forfeit a fine is corrected. If upon reinspection the commissioner
determines that a violation has not been corrected as indicated by the order to forfeit a fine, the
commissioner may issue a second fine. The commissioner shall notify the license holder by certified
mail or personal service that a second fine has been assessed. The license holder may appeal the
second fine as provided under this subdivision.
    (4) Fines shall be assessed as follows: the license holder shall forfeit $1,000 for each
determination of maltreatment of a child under section 626.556 or the maltreatment of a vulnerable
adult under section 626.557 for which the license holder is determined responsible for the
maltreatment under section 626.556, subdivision 10e, paragraph (i), or 626.557, subdivision 9c,
paragraph (c); the license holder shall forfeit $200 for each occurrence of a violation of law or rule
governing matters of health, safety, or supervision, including but not limited to the provision of
adequate staff-to-child or adult ratios, and failure to comply with background study requirements
under chapter 245C; and the license holder shall forfeit $100 for each occurrence of a violation of
law or rule other than those subject to a $1,000 or $200 fine above. For purposes of this section,
"occurrence" means each violation identified in the commissioner's fine order. Fines assessed
against a license holder that holds a license to provide the residential-based habilitation services,
as defined under section 245B.02, subdivision 20, and a license to provide foster care, may be
assessed against both licenses for the same occurrence, but the combined amount of the fines shall
not exceed the amount specified in this clause for that occurrence.
    (5) When a fine has been assessed, the license holder may not avoid payment by closing, selling,
or otherwise transferring the licensed program to a third party. In such an event, the license holder
will be personally liable for payment. In the case of a corporation, each controlling individual is
personally and jointly liable for payment.

section 260C.301, or a similar law of another jurisdiction; or
    (4) committed an act that has resulted in the involuntary transfer of permanent legal and physical
custody of a child to a relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (d), clause (1), or
a similar law of another jurisdiction.
    (o) Persons who conduct assessments or investigations under this section shall take into account
accepted child-rearing practices of the culture in which a child participates and accepted teacher
discipline practices, which are not injurious to the child's health, welfare, and safety.
   (p) "Accidental" means a sudden, not reasonably foreseeable, and unexpected occurrence or
event which:
   (1) is not likely to occur and could not have been prevented by exercise of due care; and
    (2) if occurring while a child is receiving services from a facility, happens when the facility and
the employee or person providing services in the facility are in compliance with the laws and rules
relevant to the occurrence or event.
   (q) "Nonmaltreatment mistake" means:
    (1) at the time of the incident, the individual was performing duties identified in the center's
child care program plan required under Minnesota Rules, part 9503.0045;

    (2) the individual has not been determined responsible for a similar incident that resulted in a
finding of maltreatment for at least seven years;
   (3) the individual has not been determined to have committed a similar nonmaltreatment mistake
under this paragraph for at least four years;
    (4) any injury to a child resulting from the incident, if treated, is treated only with remedies that
are available over the counter, whether ordered by a medical professional or not; and
    (5) except for the period when the incident occurred, the facility and the individual providing
services were both in compliance with all licensing requirements relevant to the incident.
    This definition only applies to child care centers licensed under Minnesota Rules, chapter 9503.
If clauses (1) to (5) apply, rather than making a determination of substantial maltreatment by the
individual, the commissioner of human services shall determine that a nonmaltreatment mistake
was made by the individual.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 626.556, subdivision 10e, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 10e. Determinations. (a) The local welfare agency shall conclude the family assessment
or the investigation within 45 days of the receipt of a report. The conclusion of the assessment or
investigation may be extended to permit the completion of a criminal investigation or the receipt of
expert information requested within 45 days of the receipt of the report.
    (b) After conducting a family assessment, the local welfare agency shall determine whether
services are needed to address the safety of the child and other family members and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment.
     (c) After conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall make two determinations:
first, whether maltreatment has occurred; and second, whether child protective services are needed.
    (d) If the commissioner of education conducts an assessment or investigation, the commissioner
shall determine whether maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken
by the school facility. If a determination is made that maltreatment has occurred, the commissioner
shall report to the employer, the school board, and any appropriate licensing entity the determination
that maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken by the school facility.
In all other cases, the commissioner shall inform the school board or employer that a report was
received, the subject of the report, the date of the initial report, the category of maltreatment alleged
as defined in paragraph (f), the fact that maltreatment was not determined, and a summary of the
specific reasons for the determination.
    (e) When maltreatment is determined in an investigation involving a facility, the investigating
agency shall also determine whether the facility or individual was responsible, or whether both the
facility and the individual were responsible for the maltreatment using the mitigating factors in
paragraph (i). Determinations under this subdivision must be made based on a preponderance of the
evidence and are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as maintained by the commissioner
of education.
   (f) For the purposes of this subdivision, "maltreatment" means any of the following acts or
omissions:
10586                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [98TH DAY

   (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (g);
   (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (f);
   (3) sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
   (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (m); or
   (5) maltreatment of a child in a facility as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (i).
    (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination that child protective services are
needed means that the local welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment
or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, as defined in section 626.559,
subdivision 1, to conclude that a child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective intervention
is not provided and that the individuals responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not
likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or risk of maltreatment.
    (h) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has occurred solely because the child's
parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and depends
upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu
of medical care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious danger to the child's health,
the local welfare agency may ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child.
   (i) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party, or whether
both the facility and the individual are responsible for determined maltreatment in a facility, the
investigating agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were according to, and followed
the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive; however,
this is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive or knew or should have known of
the errors and took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements placed
upon an employee, including the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and the
adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility training, an individual's participation in the
training, the caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the scope of the individual
employee's authority and discretion; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
The evaluation of the facility's responsibility under clause (2) must not be based on the completeness
of the risk assessment or risk reduction plan required under section 245A.66, but must be based on
the facility's compliance with the regulatory standards for policies and procedures, training, and
supervision as cited in Minnesota Statutes and Minnesota Rules.
    (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (i), when maltreatment is determined to have been committed
by an individual who is also the facility license holder, both the individual and the facility must
be determined responsible for the maltreatment, and both the background study disqualification
standards under section 245C.15, subdivision 4, and the licensing actions under sections 245A.06
98TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 6, 2010                                      10587

or 245A.07 apply.
    (k) Individual counties may implement more detailed definitions or criteria that indicate which
allegations to investigate, as long as a county's policies are consistent with the definitions in
the statutes and rules and are approved by the county board. Each local welfare agency shall
periodically inform mandated reporters under subdivision 3 who work in the county of the
definitions of maltreatment in the statutes and rules and any additional definitions or criteria that
have been approved by the county board.

year no later than March 1.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011.
    Sec. 23. TRANSFER OF REAL PROPERTY.
    (a) Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, sections 16B.281 to 16B.287, or other law,
administrative rule, or commissioner's order to the contrary, the commissioner of administration
may, in one or more transactions, sell by private sale to a federally recognized Indian tribe located
in the state of Minnesota for fair market value all or part of the real property at the Brainerd

deemed conclusive under section 245C.29.
    (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the
right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction of, admission to, or Alford Plea to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions
1 to 4, or for a disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision
under section 245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified
individual and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified
based on a judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for
purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if the commissioner does not set aside a disqualification of
an individual who was disqualified based on both a preponderance of evidence and a conviction
or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the
disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the hearing conducted
under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.

    Subd. 2. Consolidated fair hearing following a reconsideration decision. (a) If an individual
who is disqualified on the bases of serious or recurring maltreatment requests a fair hearing on

    (e) In determining whether the disqualification should be set aside, the administrative law
judge shall consider all of the characteristics that cause the individual to be disqualified in
order to determine whether the individual poses a risk of harm. The administrative law judge's
recommendation and the commissioner's order to set aside a disqualification that is the subject of
the hearing constitutes a determination that the individual does not pose a risk of harm and that the
individual may provide direct contact services in the individual program specified in the set aside.

hearing. In such cases, the scope of review by the human services referee shall include both
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification. The failure to exercise the right to an
administrative reconsideration shall not be a bar to a hearing under this section if federal law
provides an individual the right to a hearing to dispute a finding of maltreatment. Individuals and
organizations specified in this section may contest the specified action, decision, or final disposition
before the state agency by submitting a written request for a hearing to the state agency within 30
days after receiving written notice of the action, decision, or final disposition, or within 90 days of
such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or relative shows good cause why the request
was not submitted within the 30-day time limit; or
    (11) any person with an outstanding debt resulting from receipt of public assistance, medical
care, or the federal Food Stamp Act who is contesting a setoff claim by the Department of Human
Services or a county agency. The scope of the appeal is the validity of the claimant agency's intention
to request a setoff of a refund under chapter 270A against the debt.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.
   (c) For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
    (d) The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under paragraph (a), clause
(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement

under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care
payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.
   (e) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.
   (f) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (g) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.556, subdivision 10i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10i. Administrative reconsideration; review panel. (a) Administrative reconsideration
is not applicable in family assessments since no determination concerning maltreatment is made.
For investigations, except as provided under paragraph (e), an individual or facility that the
commissioner of human services, a local social service agency, or the commissioner of education
determines has maltreated a child, an interested person acting on behalf of the child, regardless
of the determination, who contests the investigating agency's final determination regarding
maltreatment, may request the investigating agency to reconsider its final determination regarding
maltreatment. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the investigating
agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice of the final determination regarding
maltreatment or, if the request is made by an interested person who is not entitled to notice, within
15 days after receipt of the notice by the parent or guardian of the child. If mailed, the request for
reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency within 15 calendar days
of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. If the request for reconsideration
is made by personal service, it must be received by the investigating agency within 15 calendar
days after the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. Effective January 1,
2002, an individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under this section and who
was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification
under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the maltreatment determination and notice of
disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the investigating agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the investigating agency denies the request
or fails to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration,
the person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045 may submit to the commissioner
of human services or the commissioner of education a written request for a hearing under that
section. Section 256.045 also governs hearings requested to contest a final determination of the
commissioner of education. For reports involving maltreatment of a child in a facility, an interested

serious or recurring maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or
a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case
hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for
under section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the contested case hearing shall include the
maltreatment determination, disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license. In such
cases, a fair hearing regarding the maltreatment determination and disqualification shall not be
conducted under section 256.045. Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration
of a maltreatment determination as provided under this subdivision, and reconsideration of a
disqualification as provided under section 245C.22, shall also not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and

    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under section
245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections 245C.27,
626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.

    Subd. 9d. Administrative reconsideration; review panel. (a) Except as provided under
paragraph (e), any individual or facility which a lead agency determines has maltreated a vulnerable
adult, or the vulnerable adult or an interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult,
regardless of the lead agency's determination, who contests the lead agency's final disposition of
an allegation of maltreatment, may request the lead agency to reconsider its final disposition. The
request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the lead agency within 15 calendar days
after receipt of notice of final disposition or, if the request is made by an interested person who
is not entitled to notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the vulnerable adult or the
vulnerable adult's legal guardian. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and
sent to the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final
disposition. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the
lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final disposition.
An individual who was determined to have maltreated a vulnerable adult under this section and
who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the lead
agency within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification. If the
request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the lead agency
within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the lead agency denies the request or fails
to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration, the
person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045, may submit to the commissioner
of human services a written request for a hearing under that statute. The vulnerable adult, or an

interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult, may request a review by the Vulnerable
Adult Maltreatment Review Panel under section 256.021 if the lead agency denies the request or
fails to act upon the request, or if the vulnerable adult or interested person contests a reconsidered
disposition. The lead agency shall notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under
this paragraph. The request must be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the
lead agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration
or of a reconsidered disposition. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency
determination with which the person is dissatisfied.
   (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the lead agency changes the final disposition, it
shall notify the parties specified in subdivision 9c, paragraph (d).
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult"
means a person designated in writing by the vulnerable adult to act on behalf of the vulnerable
adult, or a legal guardian or conservator or other legal representative, a proxy or health care agent
appointed under chapter 145B or 145C, or an individual who is related to the vulnerable adult, as
defined in section 245A.02, subdivision 13.
     (e) If an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, on the basis of a
determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and the individual has requested
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph (a) and reconsideration of
the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and requested reconsideration of the disqualification shall be consolidated into a
single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination is denied ­                     o­r­

    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under section
245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections 245C.27,
626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) Until August 1, 2002, an individual or facility that was determined by the commissioner of
human services or the commissioner of health to be responsible for neglect under section 626.5572,
subdivision 17, after October 1, 1995, and before August 1, 2001, that believes that the finding
of neglect does not meet an amended definition of neglect may request a reconsideration of the
determination of neglect. The commissioner of human services or the commissioner of health shall
mail a notice to the last known address of individuals who are eligible to seek this reconsideration.
The request for reconsideration must state how the established findings no longer meet the elements
of the definition of neglect. The commissioner shall review the request for reconsideration and make
a determination within 15 calendar days. The commissioner's decision on this reconsideration is the
final agency action.
   (1) For purposes of compliance with the data destruction schedule under subdivision 12b,
paragraph (d), when a finding of substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a
reconsideration under this paragraph, the date of the original finding of a substantiated maltreatment
must be used to calculate the destruction date.
    (2) For purposes of any background studies under chapter 245C, when a determination of
substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a reconsideration under this paragraph,
any prior disqualification of the individual under chapter 245C that was based on this determination
of maltreatment shall be rescinded, and for future background studies under chapter 245C the
commissioner must not use the previous determination of substantiated maltreatment as a basis for
disqualification or as a basis for referring the individual's maltreatment history to a health-related
licensing board under section 245C.31.
   Sec. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    A bill for an act relating to public utilities; requiring disclosure of public utility's travel,
entertainment, and related expenses included in rate change request; amending Minnesota Statutes
2008, sections 13.681, by adding a subdivision; 216B.16, by adding a subdivision.

                                                                                         May 5, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2519 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 2519 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.681, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 8. Public utility expense data. Treatment of employee expense data submitted in a rate
case petition is governed by section 216B.16, subdivision 17.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Travel, entertainment, and related employee expenses. (a) The commission may not
allow as operating expenses a public utility's travel, entertainment, and related employee expenses
that the commission deems unreasonable and unnecessary for the provision of utility service. In
order to assist the commission in evaluating the travel, entertainment, and related employee expenses
that may be allowed for ratemaking purposes, a public utility filing a general rate case petition shall
include a schedule separately itemizing all travel, entertainment, and related employee expenses as
specified by the commission, including but not limited to the following categories:
   (1) travel and lodging expenses;
   (2) food and beverage expenses;
   (3) recreational and entertainment expenses;
   (4) board of director-related expenses, including and separately itemizing all compensation and
10608                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [98TH DAY

expense reimbursements;
    (5) expenses for the ten highest paid officers and employees, including and separately itemizing
all compensation and expense reimbursements;
   (6) dues and expenses for memberships in organizations or clubs;
   (7) gift expenses;
   (8) expenses related to owned, leased, or chartered aircraft; and
   (9) lobbying expenses.
    (b) To comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), each applicable expense incurred in
the most recently completed fiscal year must be itemized separately, and each itemization must
include the date of the expense, the amount of the expense, the vendor name, and the business
purpose of the expense. The separate itemization required by this paragraph may be provided using
standard accounting reports already utilized by the utility involved in the rate case, in a written
format or an electronic format that is acceptable to the commission. For expenses identified in
response to paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), the utility shall disclose the total amounts for each
expense category and provide separate itemization for those expenses incurred by or on behalf of
any employee at the level of vice president or higher and for board members. The petitioning utility
shall also provide a one-page summary of the total amounts for each expense category included in
the petitioning utility's proposed test year.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, data submitted to the commission under
paragraph (a) are public data. The commission or an administrative law judge assigned to the case
may treat the salary of one or more of the ten highest paid officers and employees, other than the
five highest paid, as private data on individuals as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12, or
issue a protective order governing release of the salary, if the utility establishes that the competitive
disadvantage to the utility that would result from release of the salary outweighs the public interest
in access to the data. Access to the data by a government entity that is a party to the rate case must
not be restricted."
   Delete the title and insert:
   "A bill for an act relating to public utilities; modifying provisions related to recovery of expenses
by utilities; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 13.681, by adding a subdivision; 216B.16,
by adding a subdivision."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes

   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2011 to 2021,
