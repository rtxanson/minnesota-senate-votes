   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary of a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, and contributions
were made at the applicable rates under section 353.27, 353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service by a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, that were covered
by payments in lieu of salary deductions under sections 353.27, subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   (3) service by a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, in years during which the
public employee was not a member but for which the member later elected, while a member, to
10352                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [97TH DAY

obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted by any law then in effect;
   (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made by a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, deposited, and
credited to the fund;
    (5) a period by a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, of authorized personal,
parental, or medical leave of absence without pay, including a leave of absence covered under the
federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not exceed one year, and for which a member obtained
service credit for each month in the leave period by payment under section 353.0161 to the fund
made in place of salary deductions. An employee must return to public service and render a minimum
of three months of allowable service in order to be eligible to make payment under section 353.0161
for a subsequent authorized leave of absence without pay. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (6) a periodic, repetitive leave by a person who was first employed before July 1, 2010, that is
offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision. The leave program may not exceed 208
hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the association by the employer. A participating
member obtains service credit by making employee contributions in an amount or amounts based
on the member's average salary that would have been paid if the leave had not been taken. The
employer shall pay the employer and additional employer contributions on behalf of the participating
member. The employee and the employer are responsible to pay interest on their respective shares
at the rate of 8.5 percent a year, compounded annually, from the end of the normal cycle until full
payment is made. An employer shall also make the employer and additional employer contributions,
plus 8.5 percent interest, compounded annually, on behalf of an employee who makes employee
contributions but terminates public service. The employee contributions must be made within one
year after the end of the annual normal working cycle or within 30 days after termination of public
service, whichever is sooner. The executive director shall prescribe the manner and forms to be
used by a governmental subdivision in administering a periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment,
the member must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff of a person who was first employed before July
1, 2010, under subdivision 12, limited to three months allowable service per authorized temporary
or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee who has received the maximum service credit
allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff must return to public service and must
obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service subsequent to the layoff in order to receive
allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary or seasonal layoff;
    (8) a period during which a member who was first employed before July 1, 2010, is absent
from employment by a governmental subdivision by reason of service in the uniformed services, as
defined in United States Code, title 38, section 4303(13), if the member returns to public service with
the same governmental subdivision upon discharge from service in the uniformed service within
the time frames required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the
member did not separate from uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge
or under other than honorable conditions. The service is credited if the member pays into the fund
equivalent employee contributions based upon the contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that
the uniformed service was performed multiplied by the full and fractional years being purchased
and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual salary rate is the average annual salary during the
purchase period that the member would have received if the member had continued to be employed
97TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2010                                        10353

in covered employment rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that
rate is not reasonably certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three times
the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from the military
service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the contributions
required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of the discharge
date. Payment may not be accepted following 30 days after termination of public service under
subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause are not paid in
full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional
number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the
total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this
clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the member if the member
makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must be made from funds
available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer contribution rate or
rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary
rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The governmental subdivision
involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of service credit obtainable under
this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase period is required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and
employer contribution amounts payable under this clause. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5
percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service
to the end of the month in which the payment is received. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period; or
   (9) a period specified under subdivision 40.
    (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable
service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
     (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief
association that has consolidated with the Public Employees Retirement Association or to which
section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage provided by the public
employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following the consolidation or under
section 353.665, subdivision 4, "applicable service" is a period of service credited by the local police
or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the consolidation based on law and on
bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date of the initiation of the consolidation
procedure.
   (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either for
vesting purposes or for benefit calculation purposes.

    Subdivision 1. Grant program. The commissioner of public safety shall establish a lifesaver
grant program to assist local law enforcement agencies with the costs of developing lifesaver
rapid response programs designed to quickly find individuals with medical conditions that cause
wandering and result in many of these individuals becoming lost and missing. The search and
rescue program must electronically track a lost or missing vulnerable senior citizen or an individual
who is mentally impaired due to autism, Down Syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, or other mental
impairment that causes wandering. The lifesaver program participant wears a small transmitter
on the wrist to allow the local law enforcement agency to electronically locate the participant, if
necessary, using a radio transmitter. Grants may be awarded to new and existing programs. The
commissioner shall administer and promote the grant program throughout the state and serve as
liaison to lifesaver programs.
    Subd. 2. Lifesaver advisory task force. (a) The commissioner of public safety must convene
a task force to facilitate the coordination and implementation of lifesaver programs. When funding
for the lifesaver grants becomes available, the task force shall advise the commissioner on the
development and administration of the grant program. The commissioner shall appoint five persons
from various geographic areas of the state to the task force. The task force must be composed of
at least one member experienced in an area of mental impairment, one member experienced in the
area of law enforcement, and one member experienced in the development of a lifesaver or similar
program.
   (b) Notwithstanding section 15.059, the task force does not expire.
    Subd. 3. Application; eligibility. A county law enforcement agency or two or more county,
or county and city law enforcement agencies may apply for a grant to the commissioner of public
safety in a form and manner established by the commissioner. The application must include:
   (1) an estimate of the number of people who might qualify for lifesaver assistance;
   (2) an estimate of the start-up cost for new programs or expansion costs for existing programs;
   (3) a statement of the number of personnel available for tracking lost persons;
   (4) a statement of available local funding sources; and
   (5) other information requested by the commissioner.
   Subd. 4. Grant awards. To the extent funds are available, the commissioner, in consultation
with the advisory task force under subdivision 2, may award grants to eligible applicants to develop
a new lifesaver program grants to eligible applicants to expand an existing program. If eligible
applicants exceed the funds available, all grants must be reduced proportionately so that each eligible
applicant receives the same proportion of the amount for which the applicant was eligible. Recipients
developing a new lifesaver program shall be given priority over recipients expanding an existing
program. Grant recipients must be located throughout the state to the extent feasible and consistent
with this section.
   Subd. 5. Uses of grant award. (a) A grant recipient may use an award only for the following:
   (1) to purchase emergency response kits, which shall include, at a minimum, equipment
necessary to track and triangulate searches, transmitters, or any other related equipment; and

or expand an existing program.
    Subd. 6. Lifesaver grant program account. The lifesaver grant program account is established
in the state treasury. The account shall consist of contributions from private sources and

chapter 14 as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including at least, the annual
deadline for submitting applications for a grant, procedures for reporting search and rescue statistics

   The motion did not prevail. So the amendment was not adopted.
   Senator Vandeveer moved to amend S.F. No. 2337 as follows:
   Page 49, after line 32, insert:
   "Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.48, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited practices. A nursing facility is not eligible to receive medical
assistance payments unless it refrains from all of the following:
   (a) Charging private paying residents rates for similar services which exceed those which are
approved by the state agency for medical assistance recipients as determined by the prospective
desk audit rate, except under the following circumstances:
   (1) the nursing facility may:
   ­
   (1
    ­­) (i) charge private paying residents a higher rate for a private room,
                                                                            ­; and
    ­
    (­
     2­) (ii) charge for special services which are not included in the daily rate if medical assistance
residents are charged separately at the same rate for the same services in addition to the daily rate
paid by the commissioner.    ­;
   (2) effective July 1, 2010, through September 30, 2011, nursing facilities may charge private
paying residents rates up to two percent higher than the allowable payment rate determined by the
commissioner for the RUG's group currently assigned to the resident;
   (3) effective October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2012, nursing facilities may charge private
paying residents rates up to four percent higher than the allowable payment rate determined by the
commissioner for the RUG's group currently assigned to the resident; and
   (4) effective October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2013, nursing facilities may charge private
paying residents rates up to six percent higher than the allowable payment rate determined by the
commissioner for the RUG's group currently assigned to the resident.
    Nothing in this section precludes a nursing facility from charging a rate allowable under the
facility's single room election option under Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11. Services
covered by the payment rate must be the same regardless of payment source. Special services, if
offered, must be available to all residents in all areas of the nursing facility and charged separately
at the same rate. Residents are free to select or decline special services. Special services must not
include services which must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with licensure
10376                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [97TH DAY

or certification standards and that if not provided would result in a deficiency or violation by the
nursing facility. Services beyond those required to comply with licensure or certification standards
must not be charged separately as a special service if they were included in the payment rate for the
previous reporting year. A nursing facility that charges a private paying resident a rate in violation of
this clause is subject to an action by the state of Minnesota or any of its subdivisions or agencies for
civil damages. A private paying resident or the resident's legal representative has a cause of action
for civil damages against a nursing facility that charges the resident rates in violation of this clause.
The damages awarded shall include three times the payments that result from the violation, together
with costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees or their equivalent. A private
paying resident or the resident's legal representative, the state, subdivision or agency, or a nursing
facility may request a hearing to determine the allowed rate or rates at issue in the cause of action.
Within 15 calendar days after receiving a request for such a hearing, the commissioner shall request
assignment of an administrative law judge under sections 14.48 to 14.56 to conduct the hearing as
soon as possible or according to agreement by the parties. The administrative law judge shall issue
a report within 15 calendar days following the close of the hearing. The prohibition set forth in
this clause shall not apply to facilities licensed as boarding care facilities which are not certified as
skilled or intermediate care facilities level I or II for reimbursement through medical assistance.
    (b) Effective October 1, 2013, paragraph (a) no longer applies, except that special services,
if offered, must be available to all residents of the nursing facility and charged separately at the
same rate. Residents are free to select or decline special services. Special services must not include
services which must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with licensure or
certification standards and that if not provided would result in a deficiency or violation by the
nursing facility.
    (c)(1) Charging, soliciting, accepting, or receiving from an applicant for admission to the
facility, or from anyone acting in behalf of the applicant, as a condition of admission, expediting
the admission, or as a requirement for the individual's continued stay, any fee, deposit, gift, money,
donation, or other consideration not otherwise required as payment under the state plan. For
residents on medical assistance, medical assistance payment according to the state plan must be
accepted as payment in full for continued stay, except where otherwise provided for under statute;
    (2) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to loan any money to
the nursing facility;
    (3) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to promise to leave all
or part of the individual's estate to the facility; or
   (4) requiring a third-party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission,
expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility.
Nothing in this paragraph would prohibit discharge for nonpayment of services in accordance with
state and federal regulations.

      ) (d) Requiring any resident of the nursing facility to utilize a vendor of health care services
chosen by the nursing facility. A nursing facility may require a resident to use pharmacies that
utilize unit dose packing systems approved by the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy, and may require
a resident to use pharmacies that are able to meet the federal regulations for safe and timely
administration of medications such as systems with specific number of doses, prompt delivery of
medications, or access to medications on a 24-hour basis. Notwithstanding the provisions of this

utilizes a specific system of unit dose drug packing.

   The motion did not prevail. So the amendment was not adopted.
   Senator Hann moved to amend S.F. No. 2337 as follows:
   Page 84, after line 2, insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62A.31, subdivision 1r, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1r. Community rate. Each health maintenance organization, health service plan
corporation, insurer, or fraternal benefit society that sells Medicare-related coverage shall establish
a separate community rate for that coverage. Beginning January 1, 1993, no Medicare-related
coverage may be offered, issued, sold, or renewed to a Minnesota resident, except at the community
rate required by this subdivision. The same community rate must apply to newly issued coverage
and to renewal coverage.
   For coverage that supplements Medicare and for the Part A rate calculation for plans governed
by section 1833 of the federal Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section 1395, et
seq., the community rate may take into account only the following factors:
   (1) actuarially valid differences in benefit designs or provider networks;
   (2) geographic variations in rates if preapproved by the commissioner of commerce; ­
                                                                                      a­

   (3) age variations in rates if preapproved by the commissioner of commerce; and
    (4) premium reductions in recognition of healthy lifestyle behaviors, including but not limited
to, refraining from the use of tobacco. Premium reductions must be actuarially valid and must
relate only to those healthy lifestyle behaviors that have a proven positive impact on health. Factors
used by the health carrier making this premium reduction must be filed with and approved by the
commissioner of commerce.
   For insureds not residing in Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, or
Washington County, a health plan may, at the option of the health carrier, phase in compliance
under the following timetable:
    (i) a premium adjustment as of March 1, 1993, that consists of one-half of the difference between
the community rate that would be applicable to the person as of March 1, 1993, and the premium
rate that would be applicable to the person as of March 1, 1993, under the rate schedule permitted

on December 31, 1992. A health plan may, at the option of the health carrier, implement the entire
premium difference described in this clause for any person as of March 1, 1993, if the premium
difference would be 15 percent or less of the premium rate that would be applicable to the person as
of March 1, 1993, under the rate schedule permitted on December 31, 1992, if the health plan does
so uniformly regardless of whether the premium difference causes premiums to rise or to fall. The
premium difference described in this clause is in addition to any premium adjustment attributable
to medical cost inflation or any other lawful factor and is intended to describe only the premium
difference attributable to the transition to the community rate; and
    (ii) with respect to any person whose premium adjustment was constrained under clause (i), a
premium adjustment as of January 1, 1994, that consists of the remaining one-half of the premium
difference attributable to the transition to the community rate, as described in clause (i).
    A health plan that initially follows the phase-in timetable may at any subsequent time comply
on a more rapid timetable. A health plan that is in full compliance as of January 1, 1993, may not
use the phase-in timetable and must remain in full compliance. Health plans that follow the phase-in
timetable must charge the same premium rate for newly issued coverage that they charge for renewal
coverage. A health plan whose premiums are constrained by clause (i) may take the constraint into
account in establishing its community rate.
   From January 1, 1993 to February 28, 1993, a health plan may, at the health carrier's option,
charge the community rate under this paragraph or may instead charge premiums permitted as of
December 31, 1992."

    Marriage, so far as its validity in law is concerned, is a civil contract between a man and a woman,
to which the consent of the parties, capable in law of contracting, is essential. The legislature intends
that only a marriage between one man and one woman be recognized in this state. Lawful marriage
may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex and only when a license has been
obtained as provided by law and when the marriage is contracted in the presence of two witnesses
and solemnized by one authorized, or whom one or both of the parties in good faith believe to be
authorized, so to do. Marriages subsequent to April 26, 1941, not so contracted shall be null and

Health Plan.
   (d) To the extent permitted by federal law, the board shall have the same right of subrogation over
contractual retiree health benefits provided by employers as other contracts, allowing the Minnesota
Health Plan to recover the cost of services provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits,

Health Plan.

payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by this chapter shall result in the remedies and

delivery of high quality, coordinated health care services that enhance health; prevent illness,
disease, and disability; slow the progression of chronic diseases; and improve personal health
management. The board shall administer the Minnesota Health Plan. The board shall oversee:
   (1) the Office of Health Quality and Planning under section 62V.09; and
   (2) the Minnesota Health Fund under section 62V.19.
    Subd. 2. Board composition. The board shall consist of 15 members, including a representative
selected by each of the five rural regional health planning boards under section 62V.08 and three
representatives selected by the metropolitan regional health planning board under section 62V.08.
These members shall select the following:
   (1) one consumer member and one employer member appointed by the board members; and
    (2) five providers appointed by the board members that include one primary care physician, one
registered nurse, one mental health provider, one dentist, and one facility director.
   Subd. 3. Term and compensation; selection of chair. Board members shall serve four years.
Board members shall set the board's compensation not to exceed the compensation of Public Utilities
Commission members. The board shall select the chair from its membership.
   Subd. 4. General duties. The board shall:

    (2) hire an executive officer for the Minnesota Health Plan to administer all aspects of the plan
as directed by the board;
   (3) hire a director for the Office of Health Quality and Planning;
   (4) hire a director of the Minnesota Health Fund;
   (5) provide technical assistance to the regional boards established under section 62V.08;

of the Minnesota Health Plan.
    The board shall ensure that workers who may be displaced because of the administrative
efficiencies of the Minnesota Health Plan receive financial help and assistance in retraining
and job placement. Because there is currently a serious shortage of providers in many health
care professions, from medical technologists to registered nurses, and because many potentially
displaced health administrative workers already have training in some medical field, the dislocated
worker support program should emphasize retraining and placement into health care related
positions. As Minnesota residents, all displaced workers shall be covered under the Minnesota
Health Plan.
    Subd. 5. Conflict of interest committee. (a) The board shall establish a conflict of interest
committee to develop standards of practice for individuals or entities doing business with the

suppliers. The committee shall establish guidelines on the duty to disclose the existence of a
financial interest and all material facts related to that financial interest to the committee.
    (b) In considering the transaction or arrangement, if the committee determines a conflict
of interest exists, the committee shall investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or
arrangement. After exercising due diligence, the committee shall determine whether the Minnesota
Health Plan can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement
with a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest. If this is not reasonably
possible under the circumstances, the committee shall make a recommendation to the board on
whether the transaction or arrangement is in the best interest to the operation of the Minnesota
Health Plan for the benefit of the plan, and whether the transaction is fair and reasonable. The
committee shall provide the board with all material information used to make the recommendation.
After reviewing all relevant information, the board shall decide whether to approve the transaction
or arrangement.
   Subd. 6. Financial duties. The board shall:

10404                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [97TH DAY

increase in premiums. The board shall report to the legislature on the causes of the shortfall, reasons
for the failure of cost controls, and measures taken to correct the shortfall.
   Subd. 7. Minnesota Health Board management duties. The board shall:
   (1) develop and implement enrollment procedures for providers and persons eligible for the
program and disseminate, to providers of services and to the public, information concerning the
program and the persons eligible to receive benefits under the program;
   (2) implement eligibility standards for the Minnesota Health Plan, including standards to prevent
people moving to the state for the purpose of obtaining medical care;

functionality; and
    (9) annually report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of
representatives committees with jurisdiction over health care issues on the performance of the
Minnesota Health Plan, fiscal condition and need for payment adjustments, any needed changes

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 126C.41, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Retired employee health benefits. (a) A district may levy an amount up to the
amount the district is required by the collective bargaining agreement in effect on March 30,
1992, to pay for health insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed
employees who have terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active
teaching service or other active service, as applicable, before July 1, 1992, and to pay for health
insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who have
terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or other
active service, as applicable before July 1, 1998, only if a sunset clause is in effect for the current
collective bargaining agreement. The total amount of the levy each year may not exceed $600,000.

    (b) In addition to the levy authority granted under paragraph (a), a school district may levy
for other postemployment benefits expenses actually paid during the previous fiscal year. For
purposes of this subdivision, "postemployment benefits" means benefits giving rise to a liability
under Statement No. 45 of the Government Accounting Standards Board. A district seeking levy
authority under this subdivision must:
    (1) create or have created an actuarial liability to pay postemployment benefits to employees or
officers after their termination of service;
   (2) have a sunset clause in effect for the current collective bargaining agreement as required by
paragraph (a); and
   (3) apply for the authority in the form and manner required by the commissioner of education.
If the total levy authority requested under this paragraph exceeds the amount established in
paragraph (c), the commissioner must proportionately reduce each district's maximum levy
authority under this subdivision. The commissioner may subsequently adjust each district's levy
authority under this subdivision so long as the total levy authority does not exceed the maximum
levy authority for that year.
   (c) The maximum levy authority under paragraph (b) must not exceed the following amounts:
   (1) $9,242,000 for taxes payable in 2010;
   (2) $29,863,000 for taxes payable in 2011; and
    (3) for taxes payable in 2012 and later, the maximum levy authority must not exceed the sum of
the previous year's authority and $14,000,000.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.45, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Payment to creditors. Except where otherwise specifically authorized, state education
aid payments shall be made only to the school district, charter school, or other education organization
earning state aid revenues as a result of providing education services.

     ­­) (7) the arts, for which statewide or locally developed academic standards apply, as determined
by the school district. Public elementary and middle schools must offer at least three and require at
least two of the following four arts areas: dance; music; theater; and visual arts. Public high schools
must offer at least three and require at least one of the following five arts areas: media arts; dance;
music; theater; and visual arts.
   The commissioner must submit proposed standards in science and social studies to the legislature
by February 1, 2004.
For purposes of applicable federal law, the academic standards for language arts, mathematics, and
science apply to all public school students, except the very few students with extreme cognitive
or physical impairments for whom an individualized education plan team has determined that the
required academic standards are inappropriate. An individualized education plan team that makes
this determination must establish alternative standards.
    A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation requirements
that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A school district that
incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school year must provide
students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the opportunity to earn a
diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in effect when the students
entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve instruction or curriculum
as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and
120B.20.
   The commissioner must include the contributions of Minnesota American Indian tribes and
communities as they relate to the academic standards during the review and revision of the required
academic standards.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all school districts and charter schools beginning in the 2012-2013 school year and later.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.023, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Revisions and reviews required. (a) The commissioner of education must
revise and appropriately embed technology and information literacy standards consistent with
recommendations from school media specialists into the state's academic standards and graduation
requirements and implement a review cycle for state academic standards and related benchmarks,
consistent with this subdivision. During each review cycle, the commissioner also must examine
the alignment of each required academic standard and related benchmark with the knowledge and
skills students need for college readiness and advanced work in the particular subject area.
    (b) The commissioner in the 2006-2007 school year must revise and align the state's academic
standards and high school graduation requirements in mathematics to require that students
satisfactorily complete the revised mathematics standards, beginning in the 2010-2011 school year.
Under the revised standards:
   (1) students must satisfactorily complete an algebra I credit by the end of eighth grade; and

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all school districts and charter schools beginning in the 2012-2013 school year and later.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 120B.15, is amended to read:
   120B.15 GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS PROGRAMS.
    (a) School districts may identify students, locally develop programs addressing instructional and
affective needs, provide staff development, and evaluate programs to provide gifted and talented
students with challenging and appropriate educational programs.
97TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2010                                       10427

    (b) School districts may adopt guidelines for assessing and identifying students for participation
in gifted and talented programs. The guidelines should include the use of:
   (1) multiple and objective criteria; and
    (2) assessments and procedures that are valid and reliable, fair, and based on current theory and
research addressing the use of tools and methods that are sensitive to underrepresented groups,
including, but not limited to, low income, minority, twice-exceptional, and English language
learners.
    (c) School districts and charter schools must adopt procedures for the academic acceleration of
gifted and talented students. These procedures must include how the district will:
   (1) assess a student's readiness and motivation for acceleration; and
    (2) match the level, complexity, and pace of the curriculum to a student to achieve the best type
of academic acceleration for that student.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision
1a, shall include in the comprehensive assessment system, for each grade level to be tested,
state-constructed tests developed from and aligned with the state's required academic standards
under section 120B.021, include multiple choice questions, and be administered annually to all
students in grades 3 through 8. State-developed high school tests aligned with the state's required
academic standards under section 120B.021 and administered to all high school students in a
subject other than writing must include multiple choice questions. The commissioner shall establish
one or more months during which schools shall administer the tests to students each school year.
Schools that the commissioner identifies for stand-alone field testing or other national sampling
must participate as directed. Superintendents or charter school directors may appeal in writing to
the commissioner for an exemption from a field test based on undue hardship. The commissioner's
decision regarding the appeal is final. For students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006
school year, Minnesota basic skills tests in reading, mathematics, and writing shall fulfill students'
basic skills testing requirements for a passing state notation. The passing scores of basic skills
tests in reading and mathematics are the equivalent of 75 percent correct for students entering
grade 9 based on the first uniform test administered in February 1998. Students who have not
successfully passed a Minnesota basic skills test by the end of the 2011-2012 school year must pass
the graduation-required assessments for diploma under paragraph (b).
    (b) The state assessment system must be aligned to the most recent revision of academic
standards as described in section 120B.023 in the following manner:
   (1) mathematics;
   (i) grades 3 through 8 beginning in the 2010-2011 school year; and
   (ii) high school level beginning in the 2013-2014 school year;
   (2) science; grades 5 and 8 and at the high school level beginning in the 2011-2012 school year;

and
   (3) language arts and reading; grades 3 through 8 and high school level beginning in the
2012-2013 school year.
    (c) For students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, only the following
options shall fulfill students' state graduation test requirements:
      (1) for reading and mathematics:
    (i) obtaining an achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the Minnesota comprehensive assessments in grade 10 for reading
and grade 11 for mathematics or achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting
process on the graduation-required assessment for diploma in grade 10 for reading and grade 11 for
mathematics or subsequent retests;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in reading and the mathematics test for English language
learners or the graduation-required assessment for diploma equivalent of those assessments for
students designated as English language learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma
as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education plan or 504
plan;
    (iv) obtaining achievement level equivalent to or greater than proficient as determined through
a standard setting process on the state-identified alternate assessment or assessments in grade 10 for
reading and grade 11 for mathematics for students with an individual education plan; or
    (v) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education
plan; and
      (2) for writing:
      (i) achieving a passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma;
    (ii) achieving a passing score as determined through a standard setting process on the
state-identified language proficiency test in writing for students designated as English language
learners;
    (iii) achieving an individual passing score on the graduation-required assessment for diploma
as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education plan or 504
plan; or
    (iv) achieving an individual passing score on the state-identified alternate assessment or
assessments as determined by appropriate state guidelines for students with an individual education
plan.
    (d) Students enrolled in grade 8 in any school year from the 2005-2006 school year to the
2009-2010 school year who do not pass the mathematics graduation-required assessment for
                                                                          ­­t

    In addition, the school board granting the students their diplomas may formally decide to
include a notation of high achievement on the high school diplomas of those graduating seniors
who, according to established school board criteria, demonstrate exemplary academic achievement
during high school.
    (e) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school test results shall be available to districts for
diagnostic purposes affecting student learning and district instruction and curriculum, and for
establishing educational accountability. The commissioner must disseminate to the public the high
school test results upon receiving those results.
    (f) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school tests must be aligned with state academic
standards. The commissioner shall determine the testing process and the order of administration.
The statewide results shall be aggregated at the site and district level, consistent with subdivision
1a.
   (g) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternate assessments;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
     (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
    (h) Any 12th grade student who does not achieve a passing score on an assessment required by
this section must receive up to four weeks of remediation before the next testing opportunity. The
student may participate in any reading retest administration beginning in November of the student's
senior year, provided a valid form is available.

commissioner and to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees
having jurisdiction over kindergarten through grade 12 education on the implementation of the
requirements of this subdivision.

    When available, a school district must post its current local school wellness policy on its Web

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.16, is amended to read:
   122A.16 HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHER DEFINED.
    (a) A qualified teacher is one holding a valid license, under this chapter, to perform the particular
service for which the teacher is employed in a public school.
    (b) For the purposes of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, a highly qualified teacher is one
who holds a valid license under this chapter to perform the particular service for which the teacher
is employed in a public school or who meets the requirements of a highly objective uniform state
standard of evaluation (HOUSSE).
   All Minnesota teachers teaching in a core academic subject area, as defined by the federal No
Child Left Behind Act, in which they are not fully licensed may complete the following HOUSSE
process in the core subject area for which the teacher is requesting highly qualified status by
completing an application, in the form and manner described by the commissioner, that includes:
   (1) documentation of student achievement as evidenced by norm-referenced test results that are
objective and psychometrically valid and reliable;
   (2) evidence of local, state, or national activities, recognition, or awards for professional
contribution to achievement;
    (3) description of teaching experience in the teachers' core subject area in a public school
under a waiver, variance, limited license or other exception; nonpublic school; and postsecondary
institution;
                             ­­
   (4) test results from the P r­­­s

                                       I subject area content test;
   (5) evidence of advanced certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards;
   (6) evidence of the successful completion of course work or pedagogy courses; and
   (7) evidence of the successful completion of high quality professional development activities.
    Districts must assign a school administrator to serve as a HOUSSE reviewer to meet with
teachers under this paragraph and, where appropriate, certify the teachers' applications. Teachers
satisfy the definition of highly qualified when the teachers receive at least 100 of the total number
of points used to measure the teachers' content expertise under clauses (1) to (7). Teachers may
acquire up to 50 points only in any one clause (1) to (7). Teachers may use the HOUSSE process

to satisfy the definition of highly qualified for more than one subject area.
   (c) Achievement of the HOUSSE criteria is not equivalent to a license. A teacher must obtain
permission from the Board of Teaching in order to teach in a public school.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.091, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility. A district that offers a concurrent enrollment course according to an
agreement under section 124D.09, subdivision 10, is eligible to receive aid for the costs of
providing postsecondary courses at the high school. Beginning in fiscal year 2011, districts only
are eligible for aid if the college or university concurrent enrollment courses offered by the district:

charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action.
    (h) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;

of directors; or
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) An authorizer, after receiving an application from a school
developer, may charter a licensed teacher under section 122A.18, subdivision 1, or a group of
individuals that includes one or more licensed teachers under section 122A.18, subdivision 1,
to operate a school subject to the commissioner's approval of the authorizer's affidavit under
paragraph (b). The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A
or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
10436                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [97TH DAY

    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among

school contract.
    (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as
a cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must
establish a board of directors composed of at least five members who are not related parties until
a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according

be composed of at least five members who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the
school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents
or legal guardians of children enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members
of the school's board of directors. A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board
election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with

it makes available to the public.
    (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one

paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must show that:
   (1) the expansion proposed by the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
    (2) the charter school expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating
students' improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter
120B;
   (3) the charter school is fiscally sound and has the financial capacity to implement the proposed
expansion; and
   (4) the authorizer finds that the charter school has the management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the authorizer of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the authorizer then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school may not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.

of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating
a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed
action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and
that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the
authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract.
Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 15-business-day
period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written
request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to the charter school's board
of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal hearing before taking
final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract no later than 20

renew the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves the transfer
to a different eligible authorizer to authorize the charter school. Both parties must jointly submit
their intent in writing to the commissioner to mutually terminate the contract. The sponsor that is
a party to the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about
the fiscal and operational status and student performance of the school. Before the commissioner
determines whether to approve a transfer of authorizer, the commissioner first must determine
whether the charter school and prospective new authorizer can identify and effectively resolve
those circumstances causing the previous authorizer and the charter school to mutually agree to
terminate the contract. If no transfer of sponsor is approved, the school must be dissolved according
to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
     (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing under

     Sec. 5. [125A.031] RESOLVING DISPUTES AMONG DISTRICTS.
    If districts dispute which is the responsible district for providing or making available special
education and related services to a child with a disability who is not currently enrolled in a district
because the child's district of residence is disputed, the district in which that child first tries to
enroll shall provide or make available special education and related services to the child until
the commissioner is notified and expeditiously resolves the dispute. For purposes of this section,
"district" means a school district or a charter school.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Third party reimbursement. (a) Beginning July 1, 2000, districts shall seek
reimbursement from insurers and similar third parties for the cost of services provided by the
district whenever the services provided by the district are otherwise covered by the child's health
coverage. Districts shall request, but may not require, the child's family to provide information
about the child's health coverage when a child with a disability begins to receive services from
the district of a type that may be reimbursable, and shall request, but may not require, updated
information after that as needed.
    (b) For children enrolled in medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under
chapter 256L who have no other health coverage, a district shall provide an initial written notice to
the enrolled child's parent or legal representative of its intent to seek reimbursement from medical

assistance or MinnesotaCare for the individual education plan health-related services provided by
the district. The notice shall include:
    (1) the right of the parent or legal representative to request a copy of all records concerning
individual education plan health-related services disclosed by the district to any third party;
    (2) the right of the parent or legal representative to withdraw consent for disclosure of a child's
records at any time without consequence, including consent that was initially given as part of the
application process for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section 256B.08, subdivision 1;
and
    (3) a decision to revoke consent for schools to share information from education records does
not impact a parent's eligibility for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance.
   (c) The district shall give the parent or legal representative annual written notice of:
    (1) the district's intent to seek reimbursement from medical assistance or MinnesotaCare for
individual education plan health-related services provided by the district;
    (2) the right of the parent or legal representative to request a copy of all records concerning
individual education plan health-related services disclosed by the district to any third party; and
   (3) the right of the parent or legal representative to withdraw consent for disclosure of a child's
records at any time without consequence, including consent that was initially given as part of the
application process for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section 256B.08, subdivision 1.
The written notice shall be provided as part of the written notice required by Code of Federal
Regulations, title 34, section 300.504.
    (d) In order to access the private health care coverage of a child who is covered by private health
care coverage in whole or in part, a district must:
   (1) obtain annual written informed consent from the parent or legal representative, in compliance
with subdivision 5; and
    (2) inform the parent or legal representative that a refusal to permit the district or state Medicaid
agency to access their private health care coverage does not relieve the district of its responsibility
to provide all services necessary to provide free and appropriate public education at no cost to the
parent or legal representative.
    (e) If the commissioner of human services obtains federal approval to exempt covered
individual education plan health-related services from the requirement that private health care
coverage refuse payment before medical assistance may be billed, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) shall
also apply to students with a combination of private health care coverage and health care coverage
through medical assistance or MinnesotaCare.
   (f) In the event that Congress or any federal agency or the Minnesota legislature or any state
agency establishes lifetime limits, limits for any health care services, cost-sharing provisions, or
otherwise provides that individual education plan health-related services impact benefits for persons
enrolled in medical assistance or MinnesotaCare, the amendments to this subdivision adopted in
2002 are repealed on the effective date of any federal or state law or regulation that imposes the
limits. In that event, districts must obtain informed consent consistent with this subdivision as it

granted to an online learning student count toward the graduation and credit requirements of the
enrolling district. The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students,
including online learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online
learning students. If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds
a graduation standard or the grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or
requirement is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning
credits or courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section
124D.03, subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning
student in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online
learning provider that is not the enrolling district.

      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses equal to a maximum of 50 percent of the
student's full schedule of courses per term during a single school year and the student may exceed the
supplemental online learning registration limit if the enrolling district permits supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if the enrolling district and the online learning provider agree
to the instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for paying any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.
    (d) An enrolling district may offer online learning to its enrolled students. Such online learning
does not generate online learning funds under this section. An enrolling district that offers online
learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the reporting requirements or review criteria
under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district is a full-time online provider. A teacher with a
Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to enrolled students receiving online
learning from an enrolling district. The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts
with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The
instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a teacher holding a Minnesota
license.
    (e) Both full-time and supplemental online learning providers are subject to the reporting
requirements and review criteria under subdivision 7. A teacher holding a Minnesota license must
assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students. The delivery of instruction occurs
when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and
assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a
teacher holding a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants a waiver, a teacher providing
online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in any one online learning
course or program. Statewide assessments must be administered by a licensed school employee
in a secure location.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply to enroll in an approved full-time online learning program, consistent with
subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll in classes at a local
school under a contract for instructional services between the online learning provider and the school
district.
   (g) An online learning provider must not spend public funds for advertising in an amount that
exceeds five percent of its total operating budget. On June 30 of each year, the online learning
provider must submit a report to the commissioner showing the expenses for all advertising and the

provider's annual budget.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.095, subdivision 10, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 10. Online Learning Advisory Council. (a) An Online Learning Advisory Council
is established. The term for each council member shall be three years. The advisory council is
composed of 12 members from throughout the state who have demonstrated experience with or
interest in online learning. The members of the council shall be appointed by the commissioner.
The advisory council shall bring to the attention of the commissioner any matters related to online
learning and provide input to the department in matters related, but not restricted, to:
   (1) quality assurance;
   (2) teacher qualifications;
   (3) program approval;
   (4) special education;
   (5) attendance;
   (6) program design and requirements; and
   (7) fair and equal access to programs.
  (b) By February 1 of each year, beginning 2011, the Online Learning Advisory Council must
make recommendations to the commissioner on the following:
   (1) legislative changes necessary to increase the department's oversight of online learning
programs and providers; and
   (2) an incentive program to reward online learning programs and providers that incorporate best
practices using a hybrid program model that blends online and face-to-face education.
    (c) Annually, by February 15, the commissioner must report findings of the advisory council
to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees
with jurisdiction of kindergarten through grade 12 education finance and policy.

  Sec. 2. [120B.015] STUDENT LEARNING; DEVELOPING,                                    MEASURING,
SUPPORTING, AND IMPROVING STUDENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS.
    (a) Minnesota's ability to fairly and comprehensively develop, measure, support, and improve
student learning and success and also close the academic achievement gap relies on school districts
and charter schools using both multiple measures of student performance to evaluate student
learning and effective strategies for eliciting parent, family, and community commitment for
student success. Student achievement data provide teachers with useful information to identify
students' educational challenges, monitor students' progress, and develop means to positively
impact students' achievement. Although districts and charter schools must use the statewide exams
under section 120B.30, as one indicator of students' readiness to graduate and pursue college
or a career, it is not the sole measure for judging student learning. Consistent with statutory
requirements and local decisions, school districts and charter schools must combine statewide
exams with other performance indicators contained in this chapter and other education chapters
to determine what students know and can do and to award high school diplomas. School districts
and charter schools must use their performance indicators to account for the needs of minority
students with historically lower high school graduation rates, English language learners, students
struggling to stay in school rather than drop out or pursue a GED, the narrowing of a test-focused
curriculum, and the neglect of higher order performance skills, among other considerations, as well
as implementation costs.

      (b) Consistent with paragraph (a), student achievement measures include:
    (1) student achievement data based on the results of statewide summative assessments and
other achievement measures such as formative and informal classroom assessments, teachers'
observations of students' classroom performance, student work samples, student portfolios, and
student report cards;
      (2) other data relevant to students such as student mobility, attendance, and disciplinary actions;
and
      (3) contextual data such as students' linguistic background.
    (c) Consistent with this section, multiple measures for high school graduation include:
acknowledgment of significant demographic factors in developing policies and assessments under
section 120B.31, subdivision 4; advanced placement and international baccalaureate programs

      120B.02 EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS FOR MINNESOTA'S STUDENTS.
    (a) The legislature is committed to establishing rigorous academic standards for Minnesota's
public school students. To that end, the commissioner shall adopt in rule statewide academic
standards. The commissioner shall not prescribe in rule or otherwise the delivery system, classroom
assessments, or form of instruction that school sites must use. For purposes of this chapter, a school
site is a separate facility, or a separate program within a facility that a local school board recognizes
as a school site for funding purposes.
      (b) All commissioner actions regarding the rule must be premised on the following:
      (1) the rule is intended to raise academic expectations for students, teachers, and schools;
      (2) any state action regarding the rule must evidence consideration of school district autonomy;
and

    (3) the Department of Education, with the assistance of school districts, must make available
information about all state initiatives related to the rule to students and parents, teachers, and the
general public in a timely format that is appropriate, comprehensive, and readily understandable.
    (c) When fully implemented, the requirements for high school graduation in Minnesota must
require students to satisfactorily complete, as determined by the school district, the course credit
requirements under section 120B.024, all state academic standards or local academic standards
where state standards do not apply, and successfully pass graduation examinations as required under
section 120B.30.
   (d) The commissioner shall periodically review and report on the state's assessment process.
   (e) School districts are not required to adopt specific provisions of the federal School-to-Work
programs.
    (f) The commissioner of education and the chairs of the house of representatives and senate
committees having jurisdiction over kindergarten through grade 12 education shall have the
authority to provisionally approve for adoption of the kindergarten through grade 12 standards
developed by the common core state standards initiative supplemented with up to 15 percent
additional standards recommended by the commissioner. Following such provisional approval
for adoption, the supplemented kindergarten through grade 12 common core standards shall be
adopted by rule in accordance with this section and sections 120B.021 and 120B.023 on or before
December 31, 2010, using an expedited process in accordance with section 14.389.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.35, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Federal expectations for student academic achievement. (a) Each school year, a
school district must determine if the student achievement levels at each school site meet federal
expectations. If student achievement levels at a school site do not meet federal expectations and the
site has not made adequate yearly progress for two consecutive school years, beginning with the
2001-2002 school year, the district must work with the school site to adopt a plan to raise student
achievement levels to meet federal expectations. The commissioner of education shall establish
student academic achievement levels to comply with this paragraph.
   (b) School sites identified as not meeting federal expectations must develop continuous
improvement plans in order to meet federal expectations for student academic achievement. The

improve student achievement. The plan must include parental involvement components.
   (c) The commissioner must:
    (1) assist school sites and districts identified as not meeting federal expectations to develop
a school continuous improvement plan to improve and hold accountable those school sites and
districts identified as not meeting federal expectations, which plan shall be at a minimum consistent
with the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), United States Code, title 20,
section 6301, et. seq.; and
   (2) provide technical assistance to schools that integrate student achievement measures into the
school continuous improvement plan.

    (d) The commissioner shall establish and maintain a continuous improvement Web site designed
to make data on every school and district available to parents, teachers, administrators, community
members, and the general public.
    (e) If a collective bargaining agreement governs the school's employees, a further agreement
between the school district or charter school, the collective bargaining unit, and the department may
be entered into to address those subjects, if any, that may inhibit the successful implementation of
the school's continuous improvement plan, the agreement may address subjects including, but not
limited to:
   (1) limitations on hiring, reassigning and transferring covered employees into and out of the
school sites, such as seniority limitations;
    (2) the methodology for determining which teachers may be transferred or reassigned as part of
the school's continuous improvement plan;
   (3) work rules relating to the educational calendar and scheduling of instructional time and
noninstructional time;
   (4) instructional reform;
   (5) professional development requirements and other specialized training;
   (6) retention and employment incentives, including performance incentives for effective teachers
and principals; and
   (7) any other subject required by these regulations to be addressed in the school's continuous
improvement plan.
    (f) In the event the parties are not able to reach the agreement required by paragraph (e) within
75 days of identification under paragraph (a), each party shall present its last best offer on the areas
of disagreement along with a draft agreement to the commissioner, who shall accept one of the last
best offers, or reject all of them. If the commissioner rejects all offers, the parties have 30 days
to confer and present the commissioner revised offers for reconsideration under this section. If no
agreement is reached after good-faith negotiations have taken place on all sides, the commissioner
may intervene and impose an alternative plan for implementation.

board must require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program
to provide remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in
their institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those
for whom English is a second language. The colleges and universities must provide assistance in the
specific academic areas of deficiency in which the person did not achieve a qualifying score. School
districts must provide similar, appropriate, and timely remedial assistance that includes a formal
diagnostic component and mentoring to those persons employed by the district who completed
their teacher education program outside the state of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach
in Minnesota and did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those
persons for whom English is a second language. The Board of Teaching shall report annually to
the education committees of the legislature on the total number of teacher candidates during the
most recent school year taking the skills examination, the number who achieve a qualifying score
on the examination, the number who do not achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the
distribution of all candidates' scores, the number of candidates who have taken the examination at
least once before, and the number of candidates who have taken the examination at least once before
and achieve a qualifying score.

teacher licensure must include in their teacher preparation programs a common core of teaching
knowledge and skills to be acquired by all persons recommended for teacher licensure. This
common core shall meet the standards developed by the interstate new teacher assessment and
support consortium in its 1992 "model standards for beginning teacher licensing and development."
Amendments to standards adopted under this paragraph are covered by chapter 14. The board of

    Subd. 10. Tiered licensure. (a) The Board of Teaching shall establish requirements for issuance
of initial licenses, standard licenses, and master teacher licenses. Requirements for earning each
differentiated license must be based at a minimum on teacher performance as measured by section
122A.411.

requirements for licensure as set forth by the Board of Teaching. An initial license must be issued
prior to the issuance of a standard license and cannot be issued for a duration of less than three
years.
    (c) "Standard teacher license" means a license obtained after successfully being employed
for at least three years in the area of initial licensure, completing an induction program and
the probationary period requirements set forth in section 122A.40, subdivision 5, or 122A.41,
subdivision 2, achieving the minimum expectations for teacher performance as measured by
section 122A.411, and completing continuous improvement including reflective practice under this
section.
    (d) "Master teacher license" means having met the requirements for a standard license, meeting
the definition of "highly effective" under section 122A.411, and either being certified by the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards or demonstrating instructional leadership at
the local level according to Board of Teaching established criteria. Licensed teachers who hold
current certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards shall be granted
a master teacher license.

     Subd. 5. Probationary period. (a) The first three consecutive years of a teacher's first teaching
experience in Minnesota in a single district is deemed to be a probationary period of employment,
and after completion thereof, the probationary period in each district in which the teacher is
thereafter employed shall be one year. The school board must adopt a plan for written evaluation
of teachers during the probationary period that complies with section 122A.411. Evaluation must
occur at least three times each year for a teacher performing services on 120 or more school days,
at least two times each year for a teacher performing services on 60 to 119 school days, and at least
one time each year for a teacher performing services on fewer than 60 school days. Days devoted
to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other staff development opportunities and
days on which a teacher is absent from school must not be included in determining the number of
school days on which a teacher performs services. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b),
during the probationary period any annual contract with any teacher may or may not be renewed
as the school board shall see fit. However, the board must give any such teacher whose contract it
declines to renew for the following school year written notice to that effect before July 1. If the
teacher requests reasons for any nonrenewal of a teaching contract, the board must give the teacher
its reason in writing, including a statement that appropriate supervision was furnished describing
the nature and the extent of such supervision furnished the teacher during the employment by the
board, within ten days after receiving such request. The school board may, after a hearing held upon
due notice, discharge a teacher during the probationary period for cause, effective immediately,

    (b) A board must discharge a probationary teacher, effective immediately, upon receipt of notice
under section 122A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), that the teacher's license has been revoked due
to a conviction for child abuse or sexual abuse.
    (c) A probationary teacher whose first three years of consecutive employment are interrupted for
active military service and who promptly resumes teaching consistent with federal reemployment
timelines for uniformed service personnel under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), is
considered to have a consecutive teaching experience for purposes of paragraph (a).
    (d) A probationary teacher must complete at least 60 days of teaching service each year during
the probationary period. Days devoted to parent-teacher conferences, teachers' workshops, and other
staff development opportunities and days on which a teacher is absent from school do not count as
days of teaching service under this paragraph.

mentors or coaches or having teachers participate in professional learning communities.
   (b) Districts shall provide support to teachers throughout their probationary period to ensure
new teachers are successfully building their portfolio to meet continuing tenure requirements. The
support to new teachers shall include:
    (1) professional learning driven by standards of professional practice to improve teaching and
reflection on practice, including an orientation process introducing the new teacher to the district,
school, and teaching assignment;
   (2) training to promote professional growth and differentiation based on teacher and student
needs;
    (3) trained mentors provided with opportunities to meet with the new teacher for coaching,
collaboration, and reflection on practice; to assist in implementation of professional growth plans;
and to conduct formative assessments and observations to measure new teachers' development and
to be utilized in improvement of teaching; and

practice, student learning, and teacher evaluations conducted at least three times per year pursuant
to the objective evaluation program described in subdivision 5, paragraph (a).

bargaining representative of the teachers may negotiate a plan providing for unrequested leave
of absence without pay or fringe benefits for as many teachers as may be necessary because
of discontinuance of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused
by consolidation of districts. Failing to successfully negotiate such a plan, the provisions of
subdivision 11 shall apply. The negotiated plan must not include provisions which would result in
the exercise of seniority by a teacher holding ­   a­p

without pay or fringe benefits, as many teachers as may be necessary because of discontinuance
of position, lack of pupils, financial limitations, or merger of classes caused by consolidation of
districts. The unrequested leave is effective at the close of the school year. In placing teachers on
unrequested leave, the board is governed by the following provisions:
    (a) The board may place probationary teachers on unrequested leave first in the inverse order
of their employment. A teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights must not be placed on
unrequested leave of absence while probationary teachers are retained in positions for which the
teacher who has acquired continuing contract rights is licensed;
    (b) Teachers who have acquired continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave
of absence in fields in which they are licensed in the inverse order in which they were employed
by the school district. In the case of equal seniority, the order in which teachers who have acquired
continuing contract rights shall be placed on unrequested leave of absence in fields in which they
are licensed is negotiable;
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (b), a teacher is not entitled to exercise any seniority
when that exercise results in that teacher being retained by the district in a field for which the teacher

preservice and in-service education for special education professionals and paraprofessionals and
for a related alternative early intervening services program under section 125A.56, and other
related costs for staff development efforts. A district may annually waive the requirement to
reserve their basic revenue under this section if a majority vote of the licensed teachers in the
district and a majority vote of the school board agree to a resolution to waive the requirement. A
district in statutory operating debt is exempt from reserving basic revenue according to this section.
Districts may expend an additional amount of unreserved revenue for staff development based on
their needs. With the exception of amounts reserved for staff development from revenues allocated
directly to school sites, the board must initially allocate 50 percent of the reserved revenue to each
school site in the district on a per teacher basis, which must be retained by the school site until
used. The board may retain 25 percent to be used for district wide staff development efforts. The
remaining 25 percent of the revenue must be used to make grants to school sites for best practices
methods. A grant may be used for any purpose authorized under section 120B.22, subdivision 2,

    Subd. 8. Duties. The board must superintend and manage the schools of the district; adopt
rules for their organization, government, and instruction; keep registers; and prescribe textbooks
and courses of study. The board may enter into an agreement with a postsecondary institution for
secondary or postsecondary nonsectarian courses to be taught at a secondary school, nonsectarian
postsecondary institution, or another location. The board must not enter into an agreement which
limits a district superintendent's duty to assign and reassign teachers or administrators to the schools
in which the teachers will teach or the administrators will administer.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
   (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
    (3) before the start of the school year, and at other times as needed, assign highly effective
teachers and administrators, as defined in section 122A.411, to schools to best meet student and
school needs as determined by the superintendent;
   (4) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
   ­

   Sec. 32. COMMISSIONER; RACE TO TOP APPLICATION.
    In the state's application for the second round of the federal race to the top grant, the
commissioner of education must include a state goal for student performance on the National
Assessment of Educational Progress assessments, for closing the achievement gap, and for
increasing graduation rates. In addition, the commissioner must require teacher leaders from
the lowest performing schools to participate in the American Federation of Teachers Education
Research and Dissemination Course: School, Family, Community to foster partnerships with
families and the community. The commissioner must acknowledge, based on the legislative
auditor's report, the current successes in the state for kindergarten through grade 8 students in
targeted service programs, and propose to bring the program to scale. The commissioner must
express Minnesota's commitment and belief that closing the achievement gap begins with a strong,
robust early childhood education system by highlighting the work of the Minnesota Early Childhood
Advisory Council, the quality rating and improvement system under Minnesota Statutes, section
124D.142, Minnesota Early Learning Foundation, and Parent Aware. The commissioner must
highlight the importance of reading instruction improvements to close the achievement gap, and
the commitment in both statute and rules of the Board of Teaching to general and special education
teacher preparation in reading instruction, both preservice and through staff development. The
commissioner must further highlight the Bush Foundation work, and the work of school districts
to provide community-centered schools as an integral component of our transformation strategy.

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 473.561, is amended to read:
  473.561 EXEMPTION FROM COUNCIL REVIEW; BUSINESS SUBSIDY ACT;
CHARTER LIMITATIONS.
    The acquisition and betterment of sports facilities by the commission shall be conducted
pursuant to sections 473.551 to 473.599 and shall not be affected by the provisions of sections
473.165 and 473.173. Section 116J.994 does not apply to any transactions of the commission or
other governmental entity related to the stadium or public infrastructure, or to any tenant or other
users of them. If the football stadium is located in the city of Minneapolis, the city may spend
money for acquisition, design, construction, and operation of the football stadium, notwithstanding
any limitation in its home rule charter. Actions taken by the city under sections 473.551 to 473.599,
in a planning or regulatory capacity, actions for which fair market value reimbursement is provided
or for which standard fees are collected, and any tax exemptions established under sections 473.551
to 473.599, are deemed not to be an expenditure or other use of city resources within the meaning
of any charter limitation.

and its governing body in issuing bonds under that chapter. The bonds may be sold at any price
and at public or private sale as determined by the council. They shall be payable solely from tax
and other revenues referred to in sections 473.551 to 473.595, excepting only the ­         a­

473.5812 to 473.5814. The bonds shall not be a general obligation or debt of the council or of
the commission, and shall not be included in the net debt of any city, county, or other subdivision
of the state for the purpose of any net debt limitation, provided that nothing herein shall affect
the obligation of the city of Minneapolis to levy a tax pursuant to agreements made under the
provisions of section 473.592. No election shall be required. The principal amount shall not be
limited except as provided in subdivision 3.
    Sec. 11. [473.5812] FOOTBALL STADIUM; COUNCIL DEBT OBLIGATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Use of bond proceeds. The council may by resolution authorize the sale and
issuance of its bonds for any or all of the following purposes:
   (1) to provide funds for the acquisition or betterment of a football stadium by the commission
pursuant to sections 473.551 to 473.5814;
    (2) to refund bonds issued under this section; and
   (3) to fund judgments entered by any court against the commission or against the council in
matters relating to the commission's functions related to the football stadium.
    Subd. 2. Amount; procedure. The council may sell and issue bonds in an amount to be
determined by the council. The bonds shall be sold, issued, and secured in the manner provided in
chapter 475 for bonds payable solely from revenues and the council shall have the same powers
and duties as a municipality and its governing body in issuing bonds under that chapter. The bonds
may be sold at any price and at public or private sale as determined by the council. The bonds shall
not be a general obligation or debt of the council or of the commission, and shall not be included
in the net debt of any city, county, or other subdivision of the state for the purpose of any net debt
limitation. No election is required.
   Subd. 3. Prerequisite. The council must not sell and issue bonds under this section until the
council determines that the criteria and conditions in section 473.5814 have been met.
    Subd. 4. Security; maturity. The council may pledge to the payment of the bonds money
in the escrow account and money pledged by the city of Minneapolis under section 473.5814,
money appropriated to the council in the football stadium account in section 473.5995, and
any other revenues from leases, rents, or other sources available to the council for debt service.
Notwithstanding section 475.54, the bonds may mature at not later than 40 years from the date of
issue, or the useful life of the asset, whichever is less. The bonds must recite that they are issued
under this section and section 473.5814, and the recital is conclusive as to the validity of the bonds
and the imposition and pledge of the revenues for their payment.
    Sec. 12. [473.5813] SELECTION CRITERIA; REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.
    Subdivision 1. Selection proposals. The commission shall issue a request for proposals for
political subdivisions to be selected to finance and construct a stadium for the team. In this section,
"political subdivision" includes home rule charter and statutory cities and counties. This proposal
must be published in the State Register and contain, at a minimum, the following requirements:
    (1) a requirement that all proposals specify a location for the new stadium or a process for
10498                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [97TH DAY

selecting a site in an expeditious fashion;
   (2) a list of taxes, fees, and expenditures that will form the commitment of the political
subdivision or subdivisions to the financing of the stadium;
   (3) a list of amenities, infrastructure, and other improvements that will be offered to the team
and the commission as part of the proposal for location of the new stadium; and
    (4) if applicable, a list of any proposed subsidiary uses of proposed financing tools, such as
financing for amateur sports, libraries, or other ancillary purposes.
    Subd. 2. Process. The commission shall receive all proposals and shall publish their contents.
The team and the commission shall jointly select a winning proposal and shall negotiate all necessary
agreements with the selected political subdivision necessary to begin the process of constructing a
stadium.
   Subd. 3. Requirements. The following must be used as the basis for each proposal:
   (1) the contributions proposed by the political subdivision are available to finance the stadium
and public infrastructure;
   (2) the state of Minnesota is not required to provide additional funding or resources not explicitly
required or allowed under this act;
    (3) all provisions of this chapter must be reflected in any proposal, but a specific modification
of a provision of this chapter may be proposed as a part of a proposal; and
    (4) to the extent practicable, consistent with the purpose of constructing a stadium in a
partnership with the team, all revenues raised should be related directly or indirectly to the persons
benefitting from the stadium.
   Sec. 13. [473.5814] CRITERIA AND CONDITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Binding and enforceable. In developing the stadium and entering into related
contracts, the commission must follow and enforce the criteria and conditions in this section,
provided that a determination by the council that those criteria or conditions have been met under
any agreement or otherwise shall be conclusive. All financing and use agreements between the
council, commission, and the football team must be executed by September 1, 2010.
    Subd. 2. Team contribution. The team must agree to contribute one-third of the stadium costs,
less a proportionate share of any amount by which actual stadium costs may be less than a budgeted
amount to be determined. The team contributions must be funded in cash during the construction
period. In addition to any other team contribution, the team must agree to assume and pay when due
all cost overruns for the stadium costs that exceed the budget.
    Subd. 3. Permanent seat licenses. The team must offer permanent seat licenses for sale to the
public, which gives the licensee the right to occupy the seat, upon purchase of a ticket to the event
for all events held at the stadium. If a ticket for an event is not purchased by the seat licensee within
two weeks of the event, a ticket for the seat may be sold to the general public. Purchase of a personal
seat license must entitle the purchaser to a proportionate share of the net revenue from use of the
stadium for events other than professional football games. Upon receipt, revenue from the sale of
permanent seat licenses must be transferred by the team to the council to be used to reduce the
97TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2010                                       10499

principal amount of bonds issued under section 473.5812, and may not be used by the team as a
part of its contribution under subdivision 2. The price of the licenses and the calculation of the
proportionate share of nongame revenues shall be negotiated between the team and the commission.
    Subd. 4. Local sales tax exemption. No local sales or use tax may be imposed on sales at the
stadium site, except a general sales tax permitted under section 297A.99.
    Subd. 5. Lease or use agreements; 40-year term. The commission must enter into a long-term
lease or use agreement with the football team for the football team's use of the stadium. The
football team must agree to play all regularly scheduled and postseason home games at the stadium.
Preseason games may also be scheduled and played at the stadium. The lease or use agreement must
be for a term of at least 40 years from the date of stadium completion. The lease or use agreement
must include terms for default, termination, and breach of the agreement. Recognizing that the
presence of professional football provides to the state of Minnesota and its citizens highly valued,
intangible benefits that are virtually impossible to quantify and, therefore, not recoverable in the
event of a football team owner's breach of contract, the lease and use agreements must provide for
specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce provisions relating to use of the stadium for
professional football and must not include escape clauses or buyout provisions. The football team
must not enter into or accept any agreement or requirement with or from the National Football
League or any other entity that is inconsistent with the football team's binding commitment to the
40-year term of the lease or use agreement or that would in any manner dilute, interfere with, or
negate the provisions of the lease or use agreement that includes a specific performance clause,
providing for specific performance or injunctive relief. The legislature conclusively determines,
as a matter of public policy, that the lease or use agreement, and any grant agreement under this
chapter that includes a specific performance clause:
   (1) explicitly authorize specific performance as a remedy for breach;
   (2) are made for adequate consideration and upon terms which are otherwise fair and reasonable;
   (3) have not been included through sharp practice, misrepresentation, or mistake;
   (4) if specifically enforced, do not cause unreasonable or disproportionate hardship or loss to the
football team or to third parties; and
   (5) involve performance in such a manner and the rendering of services of such a nature and
under such circumstances that the beneficiary cannot be adequately compensated in damages.
    Subd. 6. Lease or use agreements; revenues; payments. The commission must provide in the
lease or use agreements with the football team that the football team pay for use of the stadium as
follows: an amount to be determined by the commission in the first year, and an amount each year
thereafter necessary to cover actual and projected operational costs. The commission must agree to
provide for the football team to receive all game-day revenues, suite revenues, and proceeds from
the sale of naming rights. The agreement must provide for the commission to receive all general
ticket revenues from nonprofessional football games or events.
    Subd. 7. Notice of breach or default. Until 40 years from the date of stadium completion, the
football team must provide written notice to the commission not less than 90 days prior to any action,
including any action imposed upon the football team by the National Football League, that would
result in a breach or default of provisions of the lease or use agreements required to be included
10500                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [97TH DAY

under this section. If this notice provision is violated and the football team has already breached or
been in default under the required provisions, the commission or the state of Minnesota is authorized
to specifically enforce the lease or use agreement and Minnesota courts are authorized and directed
to fashion equitable remedies so that the football team may fulfill the conditions of the lease and use
agreements including, but not limited to, remedies against the National Football League.
    Subd. 8. Enforceable financial commitments. The commission must determine before stadium
construction begins that all public and private funding sources for construction of the stadium are
included in written agreements. The committed funds must be adequate to acquire, design, construct,
furnish, and equip the stadium.
    Subd. 9. Council and commission access to football team financial information. The lease
or use agreement must provide the council and commission access to annual audited financial
statements of the football team and other financial books and records that the council or commission
deems necessary to determine compliance by the football team with sections 473.551 to 473.599,
and to enforce the terms of any lease or use agreements entered into under sections 473.551 to
473.599. Any financial information obtained by the commission under this subdivision is nonpublic
data under section 13.02, subdivision 9.
    Subd. 10. Environmental planning and zoning. (a) The commission shall be the responsible
governmental unit for any environmental impact statement for the football stadium prepared under
section 116D.04. Notwithstanding section 116D.04, subdivision 2b, and implementing rules: (1) the
environmental impact statement shall not be required to consider alternative football stadium sites;
and (2) the environmental impact statement must be determined to be adequate before commencing
work on the foundation of the football stadium, but the football stadium and public infrastructure
may otherwise be started and all preliminary and final government decisions and actions may be
made and taken, including, but not limited to, acquiring land, obtaining financing, granting permits
or other land use approvals, entering into grant, lease, or use agreements, or preparing the site or
related public infrastructure prior to a determination of the adequacy of the environmental impact
statement.
    (b) In order to accomplish the objectives of sections 473.551 to 473.599 within the shortest
possible time frame, it is necessary to establish an alternative process for municipal land use and
development review. It is hereby found and declared that the construction of a football stadium
within the development area is consistent with the adopted area plan, is the preferred football
stadium location, and is a permitted land use. This subdivision establishes a procedure for all land
use and development reviews and approvals by the municipality for the football stadium and public
infrastructure and supersedes all land use and development rules and restrictions and procedures
imposed by other law, charter, or ordinance, including without limitation section 15.99. No later
than 30 days after enactment, the commission shall establish a stadium implementation committee
to make recommendations on the design plans submitted for the stadium, public infrastructure
and related improvements, including, but not limited to, street vacation, parking, roadways,
walkways, skyways, pedestrian bridges, bicycle paths, transit improvements to facilitate public
street access to the stadium and integration into the transportation plan for the municipality and
the region, lighting, landscaping, utilities, streets, drainage, environmental remediation, and land
acquired and prepared for private redevelopment in a manner related to the use of the football
stadium. The implementation committee must take action to issue its recommendations within
the time frames established in the planning and construction timetable issued by the commission
97TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2010                                        10501

which shall provide for no less than 60 days for the committee's review. The recommendations
of the implementation committee shall be forwarded to the municipality's planning commission
for an advisory recommendation and then to the municipality's governing body for final action
in a single resolution, which final action must be taken within 45 days of the submission of the
recommendations to the planning commission. The governing body of the municipality shall not
impose any unnecessary or unreasonable conditions on the recommendations of the implementation
committee, nor take any action or impose any conditions that will result in delay from the time
frames established in the planning and construction timetable or in additional overall costs. Failure
of the governing body to act within the 45-day period is deemed to be approval. The commission
may seek de novo review in the district court of any city council action. The district court or
any appellate court shall expedite review to the maximum extent possible and timely issue relief,
orders, or opinions as necessary to give effect to the provisions and objectives in this article.
   Subd. 11. No strikes; lockouts. The commission must negotiate a public sector project labor
agreement or other agreement to prevent strikes and lockouts that would halt, delay, or impede
construction of the stadium and related facilities.
   Subd. 12. Football team name retained. The lease or use agreement must provide that the
football team and National Football League will transfer to the state of Minnesota the Minnesota
Vikings' heritage and records, including the name, logo, colors, history, playing records, trophies,
and memorabilia in the event of any dissolution or relocation of the Vikings franchise.
    Subd. 13. Public share on sale of team. The lease or use agreement must provide that, if the team
is sold after the effective date of this act, a portion of the sale price must be paid to the commission
and deposited in a reserve fund for improvements to the stadium or expended as the commission
may otherwise direct. The portion required to be paid to the commission is 18 percent of the gross
sale price, declining to zero ten years after commencement of stadium construction in increments of
1.8 percent each year. The agreement must provide exceptions for sales to members of the owner's
family and entities and trusts beneficially owned by family members, sales to employees of equity
interests aggregating up to ten percent, and sales related to capital infusions not distributed to the
owners.
    Subd. 14. Stadium design. (a) If the commission obtains private funding sources sufficient
to cover the increased costs, the commission must ensure that the stadium receives Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for environmental design, and to the extent
practicable, that the stadium design is architecturally significant. The Department of Administration
and the Department of Commerce must cooperate with the commission to obtain any grants or
other funds that are available to help to pay for the cost of meeting the requirements for the LEED
certification.
    (b) The stadium design must, to the extent feasible, follow sustainable building guidelines
established under section 16B.325.
   (c) The commission must ensure that the stadium be, to the greatest extent practicable,
constructed of American-made steel.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 473.5995, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3. Account funds appropriated. All money in the stadium account is appropriated to the
council to pay debt service on bonds issued by the council for the acquisition and betterment of a
10502                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [97TH DAY

football stadium, as authorized in sections 473.5812 to 473.5814. Money in this account may be
pledged to the repayment of the debt.
   Sec. 15. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This act is effective the day following final enactment."

    A bill for an act relating to elections; requiring an affidavit of candidacy to state the candidate's

The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 655 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendments and that H. F. No. 655 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.607, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 8. Candidates for office; address of residence. The address of residence of certain
candidates for office is classified as provided in section 204B.06, subdivision 1b.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204B.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Address and telephone number. (a) An affidavit of candidacy must state a telephone
number where the candidate can be contacted. An affidavit must also state the candidate's address
of residence as determined under section 200.031, or at the candidate's request in accordance with
paragraph (c), the candidate's campaign contact address. The form for the affidavit of candidacy
must allow the candidate to request, if eligible, that the candidate's address of residence be classified
as private data, and to provide the certification required under paragraph (c) for classification of that
address.
     (b) For an office whose residency requirement must be satisfied by the close of the filing period,
a registered voter in this state may request in writing that the filing officer receiving the affidavit of
candidacy review the address as provided in this paragraph, at any time up to one day after the last
day for filing for office. If requested, the filing officer must determine whether the address provided
in the affidavit of candidacy is within the area represented by the office the candidate is seeking.
If the filing officer determines that the address is not within the area represented by the office, the
filing officer must immediately notify the candidate and the candidate's name must be removed from
the ballot for that office. A determination made by a filing officer under this paragraph is subject to
judicial review under section 204B.44.
    (c) If the candidate requests that the candidate's address of residence be classified as private data,
the candidate must list the candidate's address of residence on a separate form to be attached to the
affidavit. The candidate must also certify on the affidavit that a police report has been submitted or
97TH DAY]                                    WEDNESDAY, MAY 5, 2010                                                        10507

an order for protection has been issued in regard to the safety of the candidate or the candidate's
family. The address of residence provided by a candidate who makes a request for classification on
the candidate's affidavit of candidacy and provides the certification required by this paragraph is
classified as private data, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12, but may be reviewed by the
filing officer as provided in this subdivision.
    (d) The requirements of this subdivision do not apply to affidavits of candidacy for a candidate
for: (1) judicial office; (2) the office of county attorney; or (3) county sheriff.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective on May 18, 2010.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 211B.20, is amended to read:
  211B.20 DENIAL OF ACCESS BY POLITICAL CANDIDATES TO MULTIPLE UNIT
DWELLINGS.
     Subdivision 1. Prohibition. (a) It is unlawful for a person, either directly or indirectly, to deny
access to an apartment house, dormitory, nursing home, manufactured home park, other multiple

     (3) filed an affidavit of candidacy for elected office.
   A candidate granted access under this section must be allowed to be accompanied by campaign
volunteers.
    (b) Access to a facility or area is only required if it is located within the district or territory that
will be represented by the office to which the candidate seeks election, and the candidate and any
accompanying campaign volunteers seek access exclusively for the purpose of campaigning for a
candidate or registering voters. The candidate must be seeking election to office at the next general
or special election to be held for that office.
    (c) A candidate and any accompanying campaign volunteers granted access under this section
must be permitted to leave campaign materials for residents at their doors, except that the manager
of a nursing home may direct that the campaign materials be left at a central location within the
facility. The campaign materials must be left in an orderly manner.
    (d) If a facility or area contains multiple buildings, a candidate and accompanying volunteers
must be permitted to access more than one building on a single visit, but access is limited to
only one building at a time. If multiple candidates are traveling together, each candidate and that
candidate's accompanying volunteers is limited to one building at a time, but all of the candidates
and accompanying volunteers traveling together must not be restricted to accessing the same
building at the same time.
     (e) A violation of this section is a petty misdemeanor.

   (5) requiring a prior appointment to gain access to the facility; or

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Laws 2010, chapter 194, section 9, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Duties of ballot board; absentee ballots. (a) The members of the ballot board shall
take possession of all return envelopes delivered to them in accordance with section 203B.08. Upon
receipt from the county auditor, municipal clerk, or school district clerk, two or more members
of the ballot board shall examine each return envelope and shall mark it accepted or rejected in
the manner provided in this subdivision. Election judges performing the duties in this section must
be of different major political parties, unless they are exempt from that requirement under section
205.075, subdivision 4, or section 205A.10, subdivision 2.
    (b) The members of the ballot board shall mark the return envelope "Accepted" and initial or
sign the return envelope below the word "Accepted" if a majority of the members of the ballot board
examining the envelope are satisfied that:
    (1) the voter's name and address on the return envelope are the same as the information provided
on the absentee ballot application;
   (2) the voter signed the certification on the envelope;
    (3) the voter's Minnesota driver's license, state identification number, or the last four digits of
the voter's Social Security number are the same as the number provided on the voter's application
for ballots. If the number does not match the number as submitted on the application, or if a number
was not submitted on the application, the election judges must compare the signature provided by
the applicant to determine whether the ballots were returned by the same person to whom they were
transmitted;
   (4) the voter is registered and eligible to vote in the precinct or has included a properly completed
voter registration application in the return envelope; ­  an
                                                           ­­d
    (5) the certificate has been completed as prescribed in the directions for casting an absentee
ballot; and

   (6) the voter has not already voted at that election, either in person or, if it is after the close of
business on the fourth day before the election, by absentee ballot.
   The return envelope from accepted ballots must be preserved and returned to the county auditor.
    (c)(1) If a majority of the members of the ballot board examining a return envelope find that an
absentee voter has failed to meet one of the requirements provided in paragraph (b), they shall mark
the return envelope "Rejected," initial or sign it below the word "Rejected," list the reason for the
rejection on the envelope, and return it to the county auditor. There is no other reason for rejecting an
absentee ballot beyond those permitted by this section. Failure to place the ballot within the security
envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject an absentee ballot.
   (2) If an envelope has been rejected at least five days before the election, the envelope must
remain sealed and the official in charge of the ballot board shall provide the voter with a replacement
absentee ballot and return envelope in place of the rejected ballot.
    (3) If an envelope is rejected within five days of the election, the envelope must remain sealed
and the official in charge of the ballot board must attempt to contact the voter by telephone or e-mail
to notify the voter that the voter's ballot has been rejected. The official must document the attempts
made to contact the voter.
    (d) The official in charge of the absentee ballot board must mail the voter a written notice of
absentee ballot rejection between six and ten weeks following the election. If the official determines
that the voter has otherwise cast a ballot in the election, no notice is required. If an absentee ballot
arrives after the deadline for submission provided by this chapter, the notice must be provided
between six to ten weeks after receipt of the ballot. A notice of absentee ballot rejection must contain
the following information:
   (1) the date on which the absentee ballot was rejected or, if the ballot was received after the
required deadline for submission, the date on which the ballot was received;
   (2) the reason for rejection; and
   (3) the name of the appropriate election official to whom the voter may direct further questions,
along with appropriate contact information.
    (e) An absentee ballot return envelope marked "Rejected" may not be opened or subject to further
review except in an election contest filed pursuant to chapter 209.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 25, 2010."

The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 2668 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 2668 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 484.014, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Mandatory expungement. The court shall order expungement of an eviction case
commenced solely on the grounds provided in section 504B.285, subdivision 1, clause (1), if
the court finds that the defendant occupied real property that was subject to contract for deed

   (1) the time for contract cancellation or foreclosure redemption has expired and the defendant
vacated the property prior to commencement of the eviction action; or
   (2) the defendant was a tenant during the contract cancellation or foreclosure redemption period

   Sec. 2. [504B.118] RECEIPT FOR RENT PAID IN CASH.

for payment immediately upon receipt if the payment is made in person, or within three business
days if payment in cash is not made in person.
   Sec. 3. [504B.172] RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES.
    If a residential lease specifies an action, circumstances, or an extent to which a landlord, directly,
or through additional rent, may recover attorney fees in an action between the landlord and tenant,
the tenant is entitled to attorney fees if the tenant prevails in the same type of action, under the same
circumstances, and to the same extent as specified in the lease for the landlord.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for leases entered into on or after August 1, 2011,
and for leases renewed on or after August 1, 2012.

    Sec. 5. [504B.177] LATE FEES.
    (a) A landlord of a residential building may not charge a late fee if the rent is paid after the
due date, unless the tenant and landlord have agreed in writing that a late fee may be imposed. The
agreement must specify when the late fee will be imposed. In no case may the late fee exceed eight
percent of the overdue rent payment. Any late fee charged or collected is not considered to be either
interest or liquidated damages. For purposes of this paragraph, the "due date" does not include a
date, earlier than the date contained in the written or oral lease by which, if the rent is paid, the
tenant earns a discount.
   (b) If a federal statute, regulation, or handbook providing for late fees for a tenancy subsidized
under a federal program conflicts with paragraph (a), then the landlord may continue to publish
and implement a late payment fee schedule that complies with the federal statute, regulation, or
handbook.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011, for leases entered into or
renewed on or after that date.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.178, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Bad faith retention. The bad faith retention by a landlord of a deposit, the interest
thereon, or any portion thereof, in violation of this section shall subject the landlord to punitive
damages not to exceed ­  $2­0
                            ­0­ $500 for each deposit in addition to the damages provided in subdivision
4. If the landlord has failed to comply with the provisions of subdivision 3 or 5, retention of a deposit
shall be presumed to be in bad faith unless the landlord returns the deposit within two weeks after
the commencement of any action for the recovery of the deposit.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.215, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:

For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, where the person holding the
real property after the expiration of the time for redemption on foreclosure of a mortgage was a
tenant during the redemption period under a lease of any duration, and the lease began after the date
the mortgage was executed, but prior to the expiration of the time for redemption, the immediate
successor in interest must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no sooner than
the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, and effective no sooner than 90 days after the
date of the expiration of the time for redemption, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides

    (b) For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, where the term of
a bona fide lease extends more than 90 days beyond the date of the expiration of the time for
redemption, the immediate successor in interest must allow the tenant to occupy the premises until
the end of the remaining term of the lease, and provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate,
effective no sooner than the date the lease expires, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides
by all terms of the lease, except if the immediate successor in interest or an immediate subsequent
bona fide purchaser will occupy the unit as the primary residence, the immediate successor in interest
must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no sooner than the date of the expiration
of the time for redemption, effective no sooner than 90 days after the date of the expiration of the
time for redemption, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides by all terms of the lease.
   For purposes of this section, a "bona fide lease" means:
   (1) the mortgagor or the child, spouse, or parent of the mortgagor is not the tenant;
   (2) the lease or tenancy was the result of an arm's-length transaction; and
    (3) the lease or tenancy requires the receipt of rent that is not substantially less than fair market
rent for the property or the unit's rent is reduced or subsidized by a federal, state, or local subsidy.
    (c) For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, in the case of a tenancy
subject to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, where the term of the
lease extends more than 90 days beyond the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, the
immediate successor in interest must allow the tenant to occupy the premises until the end of the
remaining term of the lease and provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, effective no sooner
than the date the lease expires, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides by all terms of the
lease, except if the immediate successor in interest will occupy the unit as the primary residence,
the immediate successor in interest must provide at least 90 days' written notice to vacate, given no
sooner than the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, effective no sooner than 90 days
after the date of the expiration of the time for redemption, provided that the tenant pays the rent and
abides by all terms of the lease.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.285, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Grounds when the person holding over is a tenant in a property subject to a
contract for deed. For any eviction action commenced on or before December 31, 2012, the person
entitled to the premises may recover possession by eviction when any person holds over real property
after termination of contract to convey the property, provided that if the person holding the real
property after the expiration of the time for termination was a tenant during the termination period
under a lease of any duration and the lease began after the date the contract for deed was executed
but prior to the expiration of the time for termination, and the person has received:
    (1) at least two months' written notice to vacate no sooner than one month after the expiration of
the time for termination, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides by all terms of the lease;
or
   (2) at least two months' written notice to vacate no later than the date of the expiration of the
time for termination, which notice shall also state that the sender will hold the tenant harmless for
breaching the lease by vacating the premises if the contract is reinstated.

     Subd. 1c. Grounds for evictions on or after January 1, 2013. For any eviction action
commenced on or after January 1, 2013, the person entitled to the premises may recover possession
by eviction when any person holds over real property after the expiration of the time for redemption
on foreclosure of a mortgage, or after termination of contract to convey the property, provided that
if the person holding the real property after the expiration of the time for redemption or termination
was a tenant during the redemption or termination period under a lease of any duration, and the
lease began after the date the mortgage or contract for deed was executed, but prior to the expiration
of the time for redemption or termination and the person holding the premises has received:
    (1) at least two months' written notice to vacate no sooner than one month after the expiration
of the time for redemption or termination, provided that the tenant pays the rent and abides by all
terms of the lease; or
    (2) at least two months' written notice to vacate no later than the date of the expiration of the
term for redemption or termination, which notice shall also state that the sender will hold the tenant
harmless for breaching the lease by vacating the premise if the mortgage is redeemed or the contract
is reinstated.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 504B.291, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Action to recover. (a) A landlord may bring an eviction action for nonpayment
of rent irrespective of whether the lease contains a right of reentry clause. Such an eviction action is
equivalent to a demand for the rent. There is a rebuttable presumption that the rent has been paid if
the tenant produces a copy or copies of one or more money orders or produces one or more original
receipt stubs evidencing the purchase of a money order, if the documents: (i) total the amount of
the rent; (ii) include a date or dates approximately corresponding with the date rent was due; and
(iii) in the case of copies of money orders, are made payable to the landlord. This presumption is
rebutted if the landlord produces a business record that shows that the tenant has not paid the rent.
The landlord is not precluded from introducing other evidence that rebuts this presumption. In such
an action, unless the landlord has also sought to evict the tenant by alleging a material violation
of the lease under section 504B.285, subdivision 5, the tenant may, at any time before possession
has been delivered, redeem the tenancy and be restored to possession by paying to the landlord or
bringing to court the amount of the rent that is in arrears, with interest, costs of the action, and an
attorney's fee not to exceed $5, and by performing any other covenants of the lease.
    (b) If the tenant has paid to the landlord or brought into court the amount of rent in arrears but
is unable to pay the interest, costs of the action, and attorney's fees required by paragraph (a), the
court may permit the tenant to pay these amounts into court and be restored to possession within
the same period of time, if any, for which the court stays the issuance of the order to vacate under
section 504B.345.
    (c) Prior to or after commencement of an action to recover possession for nonpayment of rent,
the parties may agree only in writing that partial payment of rent in arrears which is accepted by
the landlord prior to issuance of the order granting restitution of the premises pursuant to section
504B.345 may be applied to the balance due and does not waive the landlord's action to recover
possession of the premises for nonpayment of rent.
    (d) Rental payments under this subdivision must first be applied to rent claimed as due in
the complaint from prior rental periods before applying any payment toward rent claimed in the
complaint for the current rental period, unless the court finds that under the circumstances the
