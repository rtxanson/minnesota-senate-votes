excellent legislative coverage and unique ability to get along with and interview politicians of every
political stripe; and
    WHEREAS, a hard worker who rides the bus to the Capitol early in the morning in order to get
the early "scoop" on the stories of the day, or bums a ride from other reporters for events outside
the halls of the Capitol, Eric is a native of Duluth who graduated from Duluth East High School and
received his degree from the University of Minnesota-Duluth in 1975; and
    WHEREAS, for more than two decades, Eric has been a familiar voice on WCCO radio, starting
off as a general assignment reporter in 1980 and taking over the state political news beat in 1985;
along with his wife Cathy Wurzer, he and his trademark scarf can be seen each Friday night at 7
p.m. on TPT's weekly public affairs program "Almanac"; and
   WHEREAS, known for his over-stuffed museum-like office, complete with a moosehead on the

won several Associated Press and broadcasting awards, always bringing timely and accurate news
from the Capitol each day to his listeners on WCCO; and
    WHEREAS, Eric is a member of the Society of Professional Journalists, and in his spare time,
he enjoys playing golf, playing guitar, and collecting guitars; and

Capitol employee or regular became a loyal WCCO listener because of Eric Eskola; and
    WHEREAS, it is a relief to those who count on Eric's political insights that they will still be able
to follow his exploits on "Almanac" every week; and
    WHEREAS, Eric's wit, humor, and political insight have endeared him to all throughout
his career, and his engaging coverage of politics on daily radio will be deeply missed; NOW,
THEREFORE,
    BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the State of Minnesota that it thanks and commends Eric
Eskola for the vital role he has played as political reporter for WCCO AM, and extends best wishes
to him for all his future endeavors.

The commissioner of commerce has all the powers provided by section 45.027 and shall proceed in

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 1b. Term of license; fee; premarital education. (a) The local registrar shall examine
upon oath the parties applying for a license relative to the legality of the contemplated marriage.
If one party is unable to appear in person, the party appearing may complete the absent applicant's
information. The local registrar shall provide a copy of the marriage application to the party who is
unable to appear, who must verify the accuracy of the party's information in a notarized statement.
The marriage license must not be released until the verification statement has been received by
the local registrar. If at the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal
impediment to it, including the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue
the license, containing the full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state
of residence, with the county seal attached, and make a record of the date of issuance. The license
shall be valid for a period of six months. Except as provided in paragraph (c), the local registrar
shall collect from the applicant a fee of $110 for administering the oath, issuing, recording, and
filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics the
reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period of
six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of the
county in which the application is made may authorize the license to be issued at any time before
expiration of the five-day period required under paragraph (a). A waiver of the five-day waiting
period must be in the following form:
    STATE OF MINNESOTA, COUNTY OF .................... (insert county name)

    STATE OF MINNESOTA, COUNTY OF .................... (insert county name)
    After reviewing the above application, I am satisfied that an emergency or extraordinary
circumstance exists that justifies the issuance of the marriage license before the expiration of

confirming that it was received. The premarital education must be provided by a licensed or ordained
minister or the minister's designee, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18,
or a person authorized to practice marriage and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education
must include the use of a premarital inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict
management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)
received at least 12 hours of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory
and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."

    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request.

and is based on the salary cost of investigators or assistants and at an average rate per day or fraction
thereof so as to provide for the total cost of the investigation. All money collected must be deposited
into the general fund. A natural person licensed under chapter 60K or 82 shall not be charged costs

60A.031.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 45.30, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

may be earned as a qualified instructor at the rate of three hours of continuing education credit for
each classroom hour of approved instruction. For licensed appraisers, no more than one-half of the
continuing education hours required for renewal of a license may be earned as a qualified instructor.
No credit will be earned if the licensee has previously obtained credit for the same course as either
a student or instructor during the same licensing period.
   (c) A licensee must not receive credit for more than eight hours of continuing education in one
day.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 60A.031, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
     Subd. 4. Examination report; foreign and domestic companies. (a) The commissioner
shall make a full and true report of every examination conducted pursuant to this chapter,
which shall include (1) a statement of findings of fact relating to the financial status and other
matters ascertained from the books, papers, records, documents, and other evidence obtained
by investigation and examination or ascertained from the testimony of officers, agents, or other
persons examined under oath concerning the business, affairs, assets, obligations, ability to
fulfill obligations, and compliance with all the provisions of the law of the company, applicant,
organization, or person subject to this chapter and (2) a summary of important points noted in the
report, conclusions, recommendations and suggestions as may reasonably be warranted from the
facts so ascertained in the examinations. The report of examination shall be verified by the oath of
the examiner in charge thereof, and shall be prima facie evidence in any action or proceedings in
the name of the state against the company, applicant, organization, or person upon the facts stated
therein.
   (b) No later than 60 days following completion of the examination, the examiner in charge shall

file with the department a verified written report of examination under oath. Upon receipt of the
verified report, the department shall transmit the report to the company examined, together with a
notice which provides the company examined with a reasonable opportunity of not more than 30
days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to matters contained in the examination
report.
   (c) Within 30 days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or
rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and review the report, together with the written
submissions or rebuttals and the relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers and enter an order:
   (1) adopting the examination report as filed or with modification or corrections. If the
examination report reveals that the company is operating in violation of any law, rule, or prior
order of the commissioner, the commissioner may order the company to take any action the
commissioner considers necessary and appropriate to cure the violation;
    (2) rejecting the examination report with directions to the examiners to reopen the examination
for purposes of obtaining additional data, documentation, or information, and refiling the report as
required under paragraph (b); or
   (3) calling for an investigatory hearing with no less than 20 days' notice to the company for
purposes of obtaining additional documentation, data, information, and testimony.
    (d)(1) All orders entered under paragraph (c), clause (1), must be accompanied by findings
and conclusions resulting from the commissioner's consideration and review of the examination
report, relevant examiner workpapers, and any written submissions or rebuttals. The order is a final
administrative decision and may be appealed as provided under chapter 14. The order must be served
upon the company by certified mail, together with a copy of the adopted examination report. Within
30 days of the issuance of the adopted report, the company shall file affidavits executed by each
of its directors stating under oath that they have received a copy of the adopted report and related
orders.
    (2) A hearing conducted under paragraph (c), clause (3), by the commissioner or authorized
representative, must be conducted as a nonadversarial confidential investigatory proceeding as
necessary for the resolution of inconsistencies, discrepancies, or disputed issues apparent upon the
face of the filed examination report or raised by or as a result of the commissioner's review of
relevant workpapers or by the written submission or rebuttal of the company. Within 20 days of
the conclusion of the hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order as required under paragraph
(c), clause (1).
    (3) The commissioner shall not appoint an examiner as an authorized representative to conduct
the hearing. The hearing must proceed expeditiously. Discovery by the company is limited to the
examiner's workpapers which tend to substantiate assertions in a written submission or rebuttal.
The commissioner or the commissioner's representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance of
witnesses or the production of documents considered relevant to the investigation whether under
the control of the department, the company, or other persons. The documents produced must be
included in the record. Testimony taken by the commissioner or the commissioner's representative
must be under oath and preserved for the record.
    This section does not require the department to disclose information or records which would
indicate or show the existence or content of an investigation or activity of a criminal justice agency.

   (4) The hearing must proceed with the commissioner or the commissioner's representative
posing questions to the persons subpoenaed. Thereafter, the company and the department may
present testimony relevant to the investigation. Cross-examination may be conducted only by the
commissioner or the commissioner's representative. The company and the department shall be
permitted to make closing statements and may be represented by counsel of their choice.
    (e)(1) Upon the adoption of the examination report under paragraph (c), clause (1), the
commissioner shall continue to hold the content of the examination report as private and
confidential information for a period of 30 days except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b).
Thereafter, the commissioner may open the report for public inspection if a court of competent
jurisdiction has not stayed its publication.
    (2) Nothing contained in this subdivision prevents or shall be construed as prohibiting the
commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination
report or results, or any matter relating to the reports, to the Commerce Department or the insurance
department of another state or country, or to law enforcement officials of this or another state or
agency of the federal government at any time, if the agency or office receiving the report or matters
relating to the report agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this
subdivision.
   (3) If the commissioner determines that regulatory action is appropriate as a result of an
examination, the commissioner may initiate proceedings or actions as provided by law.
    (f) All working papers, recorded information, documents and copies thereof produced by,
obtained by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination
made under this subdivision, or in the course of market analysis, must be given confidential
treatment and are not subject to subpoena and may not be made public by the commissioner or any
other person, except to the extent provided in paragraph (e). Access may also be granted to the

employee, the employer shall inform the employee within 14 days after termination or layoff of:
    (1) the employee's right to elect to continue the coverage;
    (2) the amount the employee must pay monthly to the employer to retain the coverage;
  (3) the manner in which and the office of the employer to which the payment to the employer
must be made; and
    (4) the time by which the payments to the employer must be made to retain coverage.
   The employee has 60 days within which to elect coverage. The 60-day period shall begin to run
on the date coverage would otherwise terminate or on the date upon which notice of the right to
coverage is received, whichever is later.
    If the covered employee or covered dependent dies during the 60-day election period and
before the covered employee makes an election to continue or reject continuation, then the covered
employee will be considered to have elected continuation of coverage. The beneficiary previously
selected by the former employee or covered dependent would then be entitled to a death benefit
equal to the amount of insurance that could have been continued less any unpaid premium owing
as of the date of death.
    Notice must be in writing and sent by first class mail to the employee's last known address which
the employee has provided to the employer.
      A notice in substantially the following form is sufficient: "As a terminated or laid off employee,
the law authorizes you to maintain your group insurance benefits, in an amount equal to the amount
of insurance in effect on the date you terminated or were laid off from employment, for a period of
up to 18 months. To do so, you must notify your former employer within 60 days of your receipt of
this notice that you intend to retain this coverage and must make a monthly payment of $............ at

benefits to prohibit greater than 100 percent coverage when an insured, subscriber, or enrollee is
covered by both an individual and a group contract providing coverage for hospital and medical
treatment or expenses. Benefits coordinated under this paragraph must provide for 100 percent
coverage of an insured, subscriber, or enrollee. To the extent appropriate, all coordination of benefits

Rules, part 2742.0200, subpart 2, and in Minnesota Rules, part 4685.0910, subpart 7, an individual

applicable coordination of benefit rules. When a covered person's other coverage is Medicare or
TRICARE, a health plan company must determine primacy and coordinate benefits in accordance
with the Medicare Secondary Payor or TRICARE provisions of federal law. This paragraph does
not apply to specified accident, hospital indemnity, specified disease, or other limited benefit
insurance policies.

    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62E.14, subdivision 4c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4c. Waiver of preexisting conditions for persons whose coverage is terminated or who
exceed the maximum lifetime benefit. (a) A Minnesota resident may enroll in the comprehensive
health plan with a waiver of the preexisting condition limitation described in subdivision 3 if that
persons's application for coverage is received by the writing carrier no later than 90 days after
termination of prior coverage and if the termination is for reasons other than fraud or nonpayment
of premiums.
    For purposes of this paragraph, termination of prior coverage includes exceeding the maximum
lifetime benefit of existing coverage.

   Coverage in the comprehensive health plan is effective on the date of termination of prior
coverage. The availability of conversion rights does not affect a person's rights under this paragraph.
   This section does not apply to prior coverage provided under policies designed primarily to
provide coverage payable on a per diem, fixed indemnity, or nonexpense incurred basis, or policies
providing only accident coverage.
    (b) An eligible individual, as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA), United States Code, chapter 42, section 300gg-41(b) may enroll in the comprehensive
health insurance plan with a waiver of the preexisting condition limitation described in subdivision
3 and a waiver of the evidence of rejection or similar events described in subdivision 1, clause (c).
The eligible individual must apply for enrollment under this paragraph by submitting a substantially
complete application that is received by the writing carrier no later than 63 days after termination
of prior coverage, and coverage under the comprehensive health insurance plan is effective as of
the date of receipt of the complete application. The six-month durational residency requirement
provided in section 62E.02, subdivision 13, does not apply with respect to eligibility for enrollment
under this paragraph, but the applicant must be a Minnesota resident as of the date that the application
was received by the writing carrier. A person's eligibility to enroll under this paragraph does not
affect the person's eligibility to enroll under any other provision.

(HCTC) for health insurance costs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, section 35, may enroll
in the comprehensive health insurance plan with a waiver of the preexisting condition limitation
described in subdivision 3, and without presenting evidence of rejection or similar requirements
described in subdivision 1, paragraph (c). The six-month durational residency requirement provided
in section 62E.02, subdivision 13, does not apply with respect to eligibility for enrollment under this
paragraph, but the applicant must be a Minnesota resident as of the date of application. A person's
eligibility to enroll under this paragraph does not affect the person's eligibility to enroll under any
other provision. This paragraph is intended solely to meet the minimum requirements necessary
to qualify the comprehensive health insurance plan as qualified health coverage under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, section 35(e)(2).
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62L.05, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Benefits. The medical services and supplies listed in this subdivision are the benefits
that must be covered by the small employer plans described in subdivisions 2 and 3. Benefits under
this subdivision may be provided through the managed care procedures practiced by health carriers:
    (1) inpatient and outpatient hospital services, excluding services provided for the diagnosis, care,
or treatment of chemical dependency or a mental illness or condition, other than those conditions

this clause must also be covered if rendered in a nonhospital environment, on the same basis as
coverage provided for those same treatments or services if rendered in a hospital, provided, however,
that this sentence must not be interpreted as expanding the types or extent of services covered;
    (2) physician, chiropractor, and nurse practitioner services for the diagnosis or treatment of
illnesses, injuries, or conditions;
   (3) diagnostic x-rays and laboratory tests;

for any person in whole or in part on the basis of credit information, including a credit reporting
product known as a "credit score" or "insurance score," without consideration and inclusion of any
other applicable underwriting factor.
    (b) If credit information, credit scoring, or insurance scoring is to be used in underwriting, the
insurer must disclose to the consumer that credit information will be obtained and used as part of
the insurance underwriting process.
   (c) Insurance inquiries and non-consumer-initiated inquiries must not be used as part of the credit
scoring or insurance scoring process.
    (d) If a credit score, insurance score, or other credit information relating to a consumer, with

generated because of the absence of a credit history, the insurer must exclude the use of credit as a
factor in the decision to reject, cancel, or nonrenew.
   (e) Insurers must upon the request of a policyholder reevaluate the policyholder's score. Any
change in premium resulting from the reevaluation must be effective upon the renewal of the policy.
An insurer is not required to reevaluate a policyholder's score pursuant to this paragraph more than
twice in any given calendar year.
    (f) Insurers must upon request of the applicant or policyholder provide reasonable underwriting
exceptions based upon prior credit histories for persons whose credit information is unduly
influenced by expenses related to a catastrophic injury or illness, temporary loss of employment,
or the death of an immediate family member. The insurer may require reasonable documentation

transmitted or available and a record of that request is retained by the health carrier; or
    (ii) electronic transmission or access will automatically occur if the group policyholder or the
enrollee or both has not opted out of that manner of transmission by request to the health carrier
and requested that the information be provided in writing. If the group policyholder or the enrollee
or both opts out of electronic transmission, a record of that request must be retained by the health
carrier;
   (2) the group policyholder or the enrollee or both is allowed to withdraw the request at any time;
    (3) if the information transmitted electronically contains individually identifiable data, it must
be transmitted to a secured mailbox. If the information made available electronically contains

purposes of this chapter, a catastrophe exists when, due to a specific, infrequent, and sudden natural
or man-made disaster or phenomenon, there have arisen losses to property in Minnesota that are
covered by insurance, and the losses are so numerous and severe that resolution of claims related
to such covered property losses will not occur expeditiously without the licensing of emergency
independent adjusters due to the magnitude of the catastrophic damage. A failure of claims to be
resolved expeditiously shall exist upon an insurer's filing with the department a written statement
that one of the following conditions exists: (1) the insurer expects to incur at least 500 claims as a
result of the event; or (2) the magnitude of the event is expected to generate twice the mean number
of claims for one month for the affected area. Such written statement may be sent electronically
to the commissioner. An insurer must notify the commissioner via ­                            an­­­ap

    The commissioner may summarily suspend or revoke the right of any person adjusting in this

that that person has engaged in any of the practices forbidden to a licensed adjuster under sections

to the temporary address stated in the registration and to the insurer or independent adjusting firm

may be extended for an additional 30 days upon 15 days' prior notice to the applicant. The
commissioner shall grant approval for self-insurance upon a determination that the financial ability
of the self-insurer's group is sufficient to fulfill all joint and several obligations of the member
companies that may arise under chapter 176 or this chapter; the gross annual premium of the group
members is at least ­$3

administer its program; and the required securities or surety bond shall be on deposit prior to the
effective date of coverage for any member. Approval shall be effective until revoked by order of
the commissioner or until the employer members of the group become insured.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to applications
processed on or after that date, but not to self-insured groups existing as of that date.
    Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 79A.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Private employers who have ceased to be self-insured. (a) Private employers who
have ceased to be private self-insurers shall discharge their continuing obligations to secure the
payment of compensation which is accrued during the period of self-insurance, for purposes of Laws
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                        11773

1988, chapter 674, sections 1 to 21, by compliance with all of the following obligations of current
certificate holders:
   (1) Filing reports with the commissioner to carry out the requirements of this chapter;
    (2) Depositing and maintaining a security deposit for accrued liability for the payment of any
compensation which may become due, pursuant to chapter 176. However, if a private employer
who has ceased to be a private self-insurer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer authorized
to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims
for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period, the policy will:
    (i) discharge the obligation of the employer to maintain a security deposit for the payment of the
claims covered under the policy;
    (ii) discharge any obligation which the self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment
of all claims for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period; and
    (iii) discharge the obligations of the employer to pay any future assessments to the self-insurers'
security fund; provided, however, that a member that terminates its self-insurance authority on or
after August 1, 2010, shall be liable for an assessment under paragraph (b). The actuarial opinion
shall not take into consideration any transfer of the member's liabilities to an insurance policy if the
member obtains a replacement policy as described in this subdivision within one year of the date of
terminating its self-insurance.
    A private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may instead buy an insurance
policy described above, except that it covers only a portion of the period of time during which
the private employer was self-insured; purchase of such a policy discharges any obligation that the
self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment of all claims for compensation arising out of
injuries occurring during the period for which the policy provides coverage, whether or not reported
during that period.
   A policy described in this clause may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been
approved as to form and substance by the commissioner; and
    (3) Paying within 30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund, for a
period of seven years from the last day its certificate of self-insurance was in effect. Thereafter, the
private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may either: (i) continue to pay within
30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund until it has no incurred liabilities
for the payment of compensation arising out of injuries during the period of self-insurance; or (ii)
pay the security fund a cash payment equal to four percent of the net present value of all remaining
incurred liabilities for the payment of compensation under sections 176.101 and 176.111 as certified
by a member of the casualty actuarial society. Assessments shall be based on the benefits paid by the
employer during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the employer's
right to self-insure is terminated or withdrawn.
    (b) With respect to a self-insurer who terminates its self-insurance authority after April 1, 1998,
that member shall obtain and file with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding
liabilities as determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society within 120

days of the date of its termination. If the actuarial opinion is not timely filed, the self-insurers'
security fund may, at its discretion, engage the services of an actuary for this purpose. The expense
of this actuarial opinion must be assessed against and be the obligation of the self-insurer. The
commissioner may issue a certificate of default against the self-insurer for failure to pay this
assessment to the self-insurers' security fund as provided by section 79A.04, subdivision 9. The

determined as follows: a percentage will be determined by dividing the security fund's members'
deficit as determined by the most recent audited financial statement of the security fund by the total
actuarial liability of all members of the security fund as calculated by the commissioner within 30
days of the exit date of the member. This quotient will then be multiplied by that exiting member's
total future liability as contained in the exiting member's actuarial opinion. If the payment is not
made within 30 days of the notification, interest on it at the rate prescribed by section 549.09 must
be paid by the former member to the security fund until the principal amount is paid in full.
    (c) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, who
has paid assessments to the self-insurers' security fund for seven years, and whose annualized
assessment is $15,000 or less, may buy out of its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security
fund by an amount calculated as follows: 1.35 multiplied by the indemnity case reserves at the time
of the calculation, multiplied by the then current self-insurers' security fund annualized assessment
rate.
    (d) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, and who
is paying assessments within the first seven years after ceasing to be self-insured under paragraph
(a), clause (3), may elect to buy out its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security fund
by obtaining and filing with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding liabilities as
determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. The opinion must separate
liability for indemnity benefits from liability for medical benefits, and must discount each up to four
percent per annum to net present value. Within 30 days after notification of approval of the actuarial
opinion by the commissioner, the member shall pay to the security fund an amount equal to 120
percent of that discounted outstanding indemnity liability, multiplied by the greater of the average
annualized assessment rate since inception of the security fund or the annual rate at the time of the
most recent assessment.
    (e) A former member who has paid the security fund according to paragraphs (b) to (d) and
subsequently receives authority from the commissioner to again self-insure shall be assessed under
section 79A.12, subdivision 2, only on indemnity benefits paid on injuries that occurred after the
former member received authority to self-insure again; provided that the member furnishes verified
data regarding those benefits to the security fund.
    (f) In addition to proceedings to establish liabilities and penalties otherwise provided, a failure
to comply may be the subject of a proceeding before the commissioner. An appeal from the
commissioner's determination may be taken pursuant to the contested case procedures of chapter
14 within 30 days of the commissioner's written determination.

purchaser disclosure materials that, to the extent material to an understanding of the issuer,
its business, and the securities being offered, substantially meet the disclosure conditions and

11790                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [106TH DAY

   (2) a description of the real property involved;
   (3) the list price and any terms required by the seller;
   (4) the amount of any compensation or commission or the basis for computing the commission;
   (5) a clear statement explaining the events or conditions that will entitle a broker to a
commission;
    (6) a clear statement explaining if the agreement may be canceled and the terms under which
the agreement may be canceled;
     ­
     (6
      ­­) (7) information regarding an override clause, if applicable, including a statement to the effect
that the override clause will not be effective unless the licensee supplies the seller with a protective
list within 72 hours after the expiration of the listing agreement;
   ­
   (7
    ­­) (8) the following notice in not less than ten point boldface type immediately preceding any
provision of the listing agreement relating to compensation of the licensee:
   "NOTICE: THE COMPENSATION FOR THE SALE, LEASE, RENTAL, OR
MANAGEMENT OF REAL PROPERTY SHALL BE DETERMINED BETWEEN EACH
INDIVIDUAL BROKER AND THE BROKER'S CLIENT.";
   ­
   (8
    ­­) (9) for residential property listings, the following "dual agency" disclosure statement:
    If a buyer represented by broker wishes to buy the seller's property, a dual agency will be created.
This means that broker will represent both the seller(s) and the buyer(s), and owe the same duties to
the buyer(s) that broker owes to the seller(s). This conflict of interest will prohibit broker from
advocating exclusively on the seller's behalf. Dual agency will limit the level of representation
broker can provide. If a dual agency should arise, the seller(s) will need to agree that confidential
information about price, terms, and motivation will still be kept confidential unless the seller(s)
instruct broker in writing to disclose specific information about the seller(s). All other information
will be shared. Broker cannot act as a dual agent unless both the seller(s) and the buyer(s) agree
to it. By agreeing to a possible dual agency, the seller(s) will be giving up the right to exclusive
representation in an in-house transaction. However, if the seller(s) should decide not to agree to a
possible dual agency, and the seller(s) want broker to represent the seller(s), the seller(s) may give
up the opportunity to sell the property to buyers represented by broker.
                                      Seller's Instructions to Broker
    Having read and understood this information about dual agency, seller(s) now instructs broker
as follows:
 ...........            Seller(s) will agree to a dual agency representation and will consider offers

    (­
     9­) (10) a notice requiring the seller to indicate in writing whether it is acceptable to the seller
to have the licensee arrange for closing services or whether the seller wishes to arrange for others
to conduct the closing; and
    ­
    (1
     ­0 ) (11) for residential listings, a notice stating that after the expiration of the listing agreement,
       ­­
the seller will not be obligated to pay the licensee a fee or commission if the seller has executed
another valid listing agreement pursuant to which the seller is obligated to pay a fee or commission
to another licensee for the sale, lease, or exchange of the real property in question. This notice may
be used in the listing agreement for any other type of real estate.
    (c) Prohibited provisions. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d), clause (2), licensees
shall not include in a listing agreement a holdover clause, automatic extension, or any similar
provision, or an override clause the length of which is more than six months after the expiration of
the listing agreement.
   (d) Override clauses. (1) Licensees shall not seek to enforce an override clause unless a
protective list has been furnished to the seller within 72 hours after the expiration of the listing
agreement.
    (2) A listing agreement may contain an override clause of up to two years in length when used
in conjunction with the purchase or sale of a business. The length of the override clause must
be negotiable between the licensee and the seller of the business. The protective list provided in
connection with the override clause must include the written acknowledgment of each party named
on the protective list, that the business which is the subject of the listing agreement was presented
to that party by the licensee.
    (e) Protective lists. A broker or salesperson has the burden of demonstrating that each person
on the protective list has, during the period of the listing agreement, either made an affirmative
showing of interest in the property by responding to an advertisement or by contacting the broker or
salesperson involved or has been physically shown the property by the broker or salesperson. For
the purpose of this section, the mere mailing or other distribution by a licensee of literature setting
forth information about the property in question does not, of itself, constitute an affirmative showing
of interest in the property on the part of a subsequent purchaser.
    For listings of nonresidential real property which do not contain the notice described in paragraph
(b), clause ­(1
              ­0­­
                 ) (11), the protective list must contain the following notice in boldface type:
  "IF YOU RELIST WITH ANOTHER BROKER WITHIN THE OVERRIDE PERIOD AND
THEN SELL YOUR PROPERTY TO ANYONE WHOSE NAME APPEARS ON THIS LIST,
YOU COULD BE LIABLE FOR FULL COMMISSIONS TO BOTH BROKERS. IF THIS
NOTICE IS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, SEEK COMPETENT ADVICE."

    Subd. 4. Broker's examination. (a) The examination for a real estate broker's license shall be
more exacting than that for a real estate salesperson, and shall require a higher degree of knowledge
of the fundamentals of real estate practice and law.
    (b) Every application for a broker's examination shall be accompanied by proof that the applicant
has had a minimum of two years of actual experience within the previous five-year period prior
to application as a licensed real estate salesperson in this or in another state having comparable
requirements or is, in the opinion of the commissioner, otherwise or similarly qualified by reason
of education or practical experience. The applicant shall have completed educational requirements
in accordance with subdivision 8.

    Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 82.32, is amended to read:
    82.32 LICENSING: CONTINUING EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTION.
    (a) All real estate salespersons and all real estate brokers shall be required to successfully
complete 30 hours of real estate continuing education, either as a student or a lecturer, in courses of
study approved by the commissioner, during the initial license period and during each succeeding
24-month license period. At least 15 of the 30 credit hours must be completed during the first 12
months of the 24-month licensing period. Licensees may not claim credit for continuing education
not actually completed as of the date their report of continuing education compliance is filed.
    (b) The commissioner may adopt rules defining the standards for course and instructor approval,
and may adopt rules for the proper administration of prelicense instruction as required under
section 82.29, subdivision 8, and continuing education as required under this section and sections

new delivery technology, including interactive technology, and the Internet. The commissioner
may approve courses of study in the real estate field offered in educational institutions of higher
learning in this state or courses of study in the real estate field developed by and offered under
the auspices of the National Association of Realtors, its affiliates, or private real estate schools.
Courses in motivation, salesmanship, psychology, or time management shall not be approved
by the commissioner for continuing education credit. The commissioner may approve courses
in any other subjects, including, but not limited to, communication, marketing, negotiation, and
technology for continuing education credit.
    (c) As part of the continuing education requirements of this section and sections 82.29; 82.31,
subdivisions 5 and 6; 82.33, subdivisions 1 and 4 to 6; and 82.44, the commissioner shall require
that all real estate brokers and salespersons receive:
   (1) at least one hour of training during each license period in courses in laws or regulations on
agency representation and disclosure; and
    (2) at least one hour of training during each license period in courses in state and federal fair
housing laws, regulations, and rules, other antidiscrimination laws, or courses designed to help
licensees to meet the housing needs of immigrant and other underserved populations.
    Clauses (1) and (2) do not apply to real estate salespersons and real estate brokers engaged solely
in the commercial real estate business who file with the commissioner a verification of this status
along with the continuing education report required under paragraph (a).
   (d) The commissioner is authorized to establish a procedure for renewal of course accreditation.
    (e) Approved continuing education courses may be sponsored or offered by a broker of a real
estate company and may be held on the premises of a company licensed under this chapter. All
continuing education course offerings must be open to any interested individuals. Access may be
restricted by the education provider based on class size only. Courses must not be approved if
attendance is restricted to any particular group of people. A broker must comply with all continuing
education rules prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall not approve any prelicense
instruction courses offered by, sponsored by, or affiliated with any person or company licensed to
engage in the real estate business.
    (f) Credit may not be earned if the licensee has previously obtained credit for the same course
as either a student or instructor during the same licensing period.
   (g) The real estate education course completion certificate must be in the form set forth by the
commissioner. Students are responsible for maintaining copies of course completion certificates.
    (h) An approved prelicense 30-hour broker course may be used for continuing education credit
by a real estate salesperson or broker if the course is completed during the appropriate licensing
period.

     Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 82.33, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Broker's responsibility. (a) A broker shall renew the license of each eligible
salesperson who is and will continue to be associated with the broker. For the purposes of this
subdivision, an eligible salesperson is one who has demonstrated compliance with all renewal
requirements before June 15 of the renewal year.
   (b) When a broker does not intend to renew the license of an eligible salesperson who is
associated with the broker, the broker must notify the salesperson in writing 30 days before June
15 of the renewal year.
    (c) When the broker responsible for the salesperson's license renewal does not renew an eligible
salesperson's license before the renewal deadline, the broker shall pay on the salesperson's behalf
any additional higher license fees that result.

with respect to disclosure of material facts.
    Subd. 4. Nonperformance of party. If a licensee is put on notice by a party to a real estate
transaction that the party will not perform according to the terms of a purchase agreement or other
similar written agreement to convey real estate, the licensee shall immediately disclose the fact
of that party's intent not to perform to the other party or parties to the transaction. The licensee
shall, if reasonably possible, inform the party who will not perform of the licensee's obligation to
disclose this fact to the other party or parties to the transaction before making the disclosure. The
obligation required by this section does not apply to notice of a party's inability to keep or fulfill any
contingency to which the real estate transaction has been made subject.

    Sec. 92. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 327B.04, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. License prerequisites. No application shall be granted nor license issued until the
applicant proves to the commissioner that:
    (a) the applicant has a permanent, established place of business at each licensed location. An
"established place of business" means a permanent enclosed building other than a residence, or a
commercial office space, either owned by the applicant or leased by the applicant for a term of at
least one year, located in an area where zoning regulations allow commercial activity, and where
the books, records and files necessary to conduct the business are kept and maintained. The owner
of a licensed manufactured home park who resides in or adjacent to the park may use the residence
as the established place of business required by this subdivision, unless prohibited by local zoning
ordinance.
    If a license is granted, the licensee may use unimproved lots and premises for sale, storage, and
display of manufactured homes, if the licensee first notifies the commissioner in writing;
    (b) if the applicant desires to sell, solicit or advertise the sale of new manufactured homes, it has
a bona fide contract or franchise in effect with a manufacturer or distributor of the new manufactured
home it proposes to deal in;
    (c) the applicant has secured: (1) a surety bond in the amount of $20,000 for each agency and
each subagency location that bears the applicant's name and the name under which the applicant will
be licensed and do business in this state. Each bond is for the protection of consumer customers,
and must be executed by the applicant as principal and issued by a surety company admitted to
do business in this state. Each bond shall be exclusively for the purpose of reimbursing consumer
customers and shall be conditioned upon the faithful compliance by the applicant with all of the laws
and rules of this state pertaining to the applicant's business as a dealer or manufacturer, including
sections 325D.44, 325F.67 and 325F.69, and upon the applicant's faithful performance of all its
legal obligations to consumer customers; and (2) a certificate of liability insurance in the amount
of $1,000,000 that provides aggregate coverage for the agency and each subagency location. In the
event of a policy cancellation, the insurer shall send written notice to the commissioner at the same
time that a cancellation request is received from or a notice is sent to the insured;
    (d) the applicant has established a trust account as required by section 327B.08, subdivision 3,
unless the applicant states in writing its intention to limit its business to selling, offering for sale,
soliciting or advertising the sale of new manufactured homes; and
    (e) the applicant has provided evidence of having had at least two years' prior experience in the
sale of manufactured homes, working for a licensed dealer.

the agency's collection activities are limited in the same manner;
   (2) the agency's collection activities are limited to collecting debts not incurred in this state from
consumers located in this state; and

       EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
       Sec. 96. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 340A.409, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Insurance required. (a) No retail license may be issued, maintained or renewed
unless the applicant demonstrates proof of financial responsibility with regard to liability imposed
by section 340A.801. The issuing authority must submit to the commissioner the applicant's
proof of financial responsibility. This subdivision does not prohibit a local unit of government
from requiring higher insurance or bond coverages, or a larger deposit of cash or securities. The
minimum requirement for proof of financial responsibility may be given by filing:
    (1) a certificate that there is in effect for the license period an insurance policy issued by an
insurer required to be licensed under section 60A.07, subdivision 4, or by an insurer recognized
as an eligible surplus lines carrier pursuant to section 60A.206 or pool providing at least $50,000
of coverage because of bodily injury to any one person in any one occurrence, $100,000 because
of bodily injury to two or more persons in any one occurrence, $10,000 because of injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one occurrence, $50,000 for loss of means of support of
any one person in any one occurrence, and $100,000 for loss of means of support of two or more
persons in any one occurrence;
       (2) a bond of a surety company with minimum coverages as provided in clause (1); or
   (3) a certificate of the commissioner of management and budget that the licensee has deposited
with the commissioner of management and budget $100,000 in cash or securities which may legally
be purchased by savings banks or for trust funds having a market value of $100,000.
   (b) This subdivision does not prohibit an insurer from providing the coverage required by this
subdivision in combination with other insurance coverage.
   (c) An annual aggregate policy limit for dram shop insurance of not less than $300,000 per policy
year may be included in the policy provisions.
       (d) A liability insurance policy required by this section must provide that it may not be canceled
for:
    (1) any cause, except for nonpayment of premium, by either the insured or the insurer unless the

the same time that a cancellation request is received from or a notice is sent to the insured.
   Sec. 97. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 471.61, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Insurance continuation. A unit of local government must allow a former employee
and the employee's dependents to continue to participate indefinitely in the employer-sponsored
hospital, medical, and dental insurance group that the employee participated in immediately before
retirement, under the following conditions:
    (a) The continuation requirement of this subdivision applies only to a former employee who
is receiving a disability benefit or an annuity from a Minnesota public pension plan other than a
volunteer firefighter plan, or who has met age and service requirements necessary to receive an
annuity from such a plan.
    (b) Until the former employee reaches age 65, the former employee and dependents must be
pooled in the same group as active employees for purposes of establishing premiums and coverage
for hospital, medical, and dental insurance. However, a former employee under the age of 65 who is
enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B due to the former employee's disability and for whom Medicare's
obligation to pay claims is primary, and the former employee's dependents, must be pooled in the
same group for purposes of this paragraph as former employees who have reached age 65.
    (c) A former employee may receive dependent coverage only if the employee received dependent
coverage immediately before leaving employment. This subdivision does not require dependent
coverage to continue after the death of the former employee. For purposes of this subdivision,
"dependent" has the same meaning for former employees as it does for active employees in the
unit of local government.
   (d) Coverage for a former employee and dependents may not discriminate on the basis of
evidence of insurability or preexisting conditions unless identical conditions are imposed on active
employees in the group that the employee left.
    (e) The former employee must pay the entire premium for continuation coverage, except
as otherwise provided in a collective bargaining agreement or personnel policy. A unit of local
government may discontinue coverage if a former employee fails to pay the premium within the
deadline provided for payment of premiums under federal law governing insurance continuation.
   (f) An employer must notify an employee before termination of employment of the options
available under this subdivision, and of the deadline for electing to continue to participate.
    (g) A former employee must notify the employer of intent to participate within the deadline
provided for notice of insurance continuation under federal law. A former employee who does
not elect to continue participation does not have a right to reenter the employer's group insurance
program.
   (h) A former employee who initially selects dependent coverage may later drop dependent
coverage while retaining individual coverage. A former employee may not drop individual
coverage and retain dependent coverage.
106TH DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                          11813

   (i) This subdivision does not limit rights granted to former employees under other state or federal
law, or under collective bargaining agreements or personnel plans.
    (j) Unless otherwise provided by a collective bargaining agreement, if retired employees were
not permitted to remain in the active employee group prior to August 1, 1992, a public employer
may assess active employees through payroll deduction for all or part of the additional premium
costs from the inclusion of retired employees in the active employee group. This paragraph does
not apply to employees covered by section 179A.03, subdivision 7.
   (k) Notwithstanding section 179A.20, subdivision 2a, insurance continuation under this
subdivision may be provided for in a collective bargaining agreement or personnel policy.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to coverage in
existence on or after that date.
   Sec. 98. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 514.20, is amended to read:
   514.20 SALE.
    If any sum secured by such lien be not paid within 90 days after it becomes due, the lienholder
may sell the property and out of the proceeds of such sale there shall be paid, first, the disbursements
aforesaid; second, all charges against the property paid by such person to any other person; and,
third, the total indebtedness then secured by the lien. The remainder, if any, shall be paid on demand
to the owner or other person entitled thereto. If the property subject to the lien is a motor vehicle

costs related to complying with this notice provision constitute "lawful charges" pursuant to section
514.19. Failure to comply with the notice provision in this section renders any lien created by this
chapter ineffective against any secured party listed on the certificate of title of the motor vehicle
involved.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment, and applies
to notices mailed on or after that date, provided however that it is also permissible to send notices
under this section by registered mail prior to August 1, 2010, and the costs of those notices are
lawful charges under this section.
   Sec. 99. Laws 2007, chapter 147, article 12, section 14, is amended to read:
       Sec. 14. AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE HEALTH PLAN FOR FARMERS.

Statutes, chapter 62H, the following apply to a joint self-insurance pilot project administered by
a trust sponsored by one or more agricultural cooperatives organized under Minnesota Statutes,
chapter 308A or 308B, or under a federal charter for the purpose of offering health coverage to
members of the cooperatives and their families, provided the project satisfies the other requirements
of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 62H:
   (1) Minnesota Statutes, section 62H.02, paragraph (b), does not apply;

   (2) the notice period required under Minnesota Statutes, section 62H.02, paragraph (e), is 90
days;
    (3) a joint self-insurance plan may elect to treat the sale of a health plan to or for an employer
that has only one eligible employee who has not waived coverage as the sale of an individual health
plan as allowed under Minnesota Statutes, section 62L.02, subdivision 26;
   (4) Minnesota Statutes, section 297I.05, subdivision 12, paragraph (c), applies; and
   (5) the trust must pay the assessment for the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association as
provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 62E.11.
     Subd. 2. Evaluation and renewal. The pilot project authorized under this section is for a period
of four years from the date of initial enrollment. The commissioner of commerce shall grant an
extension of four additional years if the trust provides evidence that it remains in compliance with
the requirements of this section and other applicable laws and rules. If the commissioner determines
that the operation of the trust has not improved access, expanded health plan choices, or improved
the affordability of health coverage for farm families, or that it has significantly damaged access,
choice, or affordability for other consumers not enrolled in the trust, the commissioner shall provide
at least 180 days' advance written notice to the trust and to the chairs of the senate and house finance
and policy committees with jurisdiction over health and insurance of the commissioner's intention
not to renew the pilot project at the expiration of a four-year period.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
     I have received, approved, signed and deposited in the Office of the Secretary of State, Chapter
347, Senate File 2510, the omnibus economic development bill with the exception of line item vetoes
listed below.
   The following items of appropriation are veoted for the reasons outlined below:
    Page 23, lines 23.10 - 23.13: "$2,000,000 for a grant to the Mountain Iron Economic
Development Authority for renewable energy projects." There is currently a process in place for
approval of these types of projects involving the Iron Range Resources agency and board. Because
this project has not been fully vetted or approved by either of these entities, this appropriation
simply should not have been made by the Legislature.
  Page 154, lines 154.7 - 154.8: An appropriation of 2.706 cents per ton to the Virginia Regional
Medical Center for operating room equipment and renovations. Again, projects of this nature should

be approved by the Iron Range Resources agency and board before they receive funding.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that the item veto message of S.F. No. 2510 be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

                                                                                         May 15, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 355, Senate File 341.
The bill addresses the categories of individuals who under the law shall be given priority for purposes
of determining the disposition of the remains of a deceased person. Currently a person can, by
executing a will, designate who shall be empowered to control final disposition of his or her remains.
This bill therefore addresses a nonexistent problem.
Similarly, the bill addresses the class of individuals who may present notice of a wrongful death
claim to the State of Minnesota or municipalities. Currently, notice of these claims may be made by
a personal representative, surviving spouse, or next of kin. Again, a person can currently designate
the personal representative responsible for handling his or her estate's affairs via a will.
Finally, the bill adds to the class of individuals that may petition the court to appoint a trustee for
purposes of commencing a wrongful death action, as well as who may be a beneficiary of such
actions. Wrongful death actions currently may be brought in the name of, and for the benefit of,
the surviving spouse and next of kin. "Next of kin" is a precisely-defined class of individuals under
the law. The courts do not have discretion in determining this class of blood relatives. Senate File
341 expands this class of individuals who may petition for appointment of a trustee to commence,
and recover pursuant to, a wrongful death action to include a "surviving domestic partner." The
definition of "domestic partner" included in this bill includes subjective criteria that would ask the
court to ascertain whether individuals "have a committed interdependent relationship with each
other, intend to continue that relationship indefinitely, and do not have this type of relationship with
any other person." A "domestic partner" would be afforded the same legal recognition for purposes
of the wrongful death laws as a spouse.
Marriage - defined as between a man and woman - should remain elevated in our society at a special
level, as it traditionally has been. I oppose efforts to treat domestic relationships as the equivalent
of traditional marriage. Accordingly, I am opposed to this bill.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 341 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
    I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 3019, Chapter 353. The bill is budget neutral on its
face, but achieves this status by reducing spending in areas that may be needed for deficit reduction
purposes.
    In the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court opinion in Brayton vs. Pawlenty, and at a
time when negotiations with the legislature have not yet reached a breakthrough to resolve our
budget and cash flow problems, it is unwise to start a new spending program. To pay for that new
spending by reducing community service development grants overlook how those grants, and indeed
all human service spending, must be fully available for non-transferrable cuts in the closing days of
the legislative session.
    I am mindful of the underlying value of the PACE program, and am cognizant of the efforts
being made in other sections of this bill to aid governement-owned nursing homes. These matters
are more appropriately addressed after the state budget is balanced.
                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 3019 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                         May 15, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 345, Senate File 271, a bill relating to the expansion of
whistleblower protection and defining communication expectations to all decision makers for
classified state employees.
This bill may violate the separation of powers between the Legislative and Executive branches of
state government. It is an impermissible intrusion into the Executive branch's ability to manage
information and personnel.
The new provision in chapter 43A requires a classified state employee to keep information learned
from a legislator or legislative staff confidential from the Executive branch. This is in direct conflict
with the ability of an agency to direct and manage its employees.
The amended provision in Minnesota Statutes, section 181.932, eliminates the Executive branch's
ability to decide who is authorized to speak for an agency. It is reasonable for an agency to direct the
flow of information to the Legislature through a designee of the Commissioner. This ensures that
information provided by the agency is correct, consistent, and not in violation of the Data Privacy
Act.
106TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                      11833

Moreover, the United States Supreme Court opinion Garetti vs. Ceballos states: "Official
communications have official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity.
Supervisors must ensure that their employees' official communications are accurate, demonstrate
sound judgment, and promote the employer's mission."
There are sufficient protections and remedies currently in place under Minnesota Statutes, section
181.932, for employees who provide information to government bodies allowing for a private cause
of action.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 271 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

    "Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 10A.12, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 16. Penalty for noncompliant independent expenditure. An association that makes an
independent expenditure without complying with subdivision 1a is subject to a civil penalty of up

prohibited by other law, contribute revenue from membership dues or fees, or from contributions
received by the association to an independent expenditure political committee or an independent
expenditure political fund without complying with section 10A.27, subdivision 13. Before the
day when the recipient committee or fund's next report must be filed with the board under section
10A.20, subdivision 2 or 5, an association that has contributed $5,000 or more in aggregate to
independent expenditure political committees or funds during the calendar year must provide
in writing to the recipient's treasurer a statement that includes the name, address, and amount
attributable to each individual or association that paid the association dues or fees, or made
contributions to the association that, in total, aggregate $1,000 or more of the contribution from
the association to the independent expenditure political committee or fund. The statement must
also include the total amount of the contribution from individuals or associations not subject to
itemization under this section. The statement must be certified as true and correct by an officer of
the donor association.
   (b) To determine the membership dues or fees, or contributions made by an individual or
association that exceed $1,000 of the contribution made by the donor association to the independent
expenditure political committee or fund, the donor association must:
   (1) apply a pro rata calculation to all unrestricted dues, fees, and contributions received by the
donor association; or
    (2) as provided in paragraph (c), identify the specific individuals or associations whose dues,
fees, or contributions are included in the contribution to the independent expenditure political
committee or fund.
    (c) Dues, fees, or contributions from an individual or association must be identified in a
contribution to an independent expenditure political committee or fund under paragraph (b), clause
(2), if:
    (1) the individual or association has specifically authorized the donor association to use the
individual's or association's dues, fees, or contributions for this purpose; or
    (2) if the individual's or association's dues, fees, or contributions to the donor association are
unrestricted and the donor association designates them as the source of the subject contribution
to the independent expenditure political committee or fund. After a portion of an individual's or
association's dues, fees, or contributions to the donor association have been designated as the
source of a contribution to an independent expenditure political committee or fund, that portion
of the individual's or association's dues, fees, or contributions to the donor association may not
be designated as the source of any other contribution to an independent expenditure political
committee or fund.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, "donor association" means the association contributing to
an independent political expenditure committee or fund that provides a statement under paragraph
(a)."

   Senator Marty moved that his name be stricken as chief author, shown as a co-author and the

                                     SUSPENSION OF RULES

    Senator Pogemiller moved that an urgency be declared within the meaning of Article IV, Section

   Senator Stumpf moved to amend H.F. No. 2072 as follows:
   Page 1, after line 4, insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.16, is amended to read:
   122A.16 HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHER DEFINED.
    (a) A qualified teacher is one holding a valid license, under this chapter, to perform the particular
service for which the teacher is employed in a public school.
    (b) For the purposes of the federal No Child Left Behind Act, a highly qualified teacher is one
who holds a valid license under this chapter to perform the particular service for which the teacher
is employed in a public school or who meets the requirements of a highly objective uniform state

standard of evaluation (HOUSSE).
   All Minnesota teachers teaching in a core academic subject area, as defined by the federal No
Child Left Behind Act, in which they are not fully licensed may complete the following HOUSSE
process in the core subject area for which the teacher is requesting highly qualified status by
completing an application, in the form and manner described by the commissioner, that includes:
   (1) documentation of student achievement as evidenced by norm-referenced test results that are
objective and psychometrically valid and reliable;
   (2) evidence of local, state, or national activities, recognition, or awards for professional
contribution to achievement;
    (3) description of teaching experience in the teachers' core subject area in a public school
under a waiver, variance, limited license or other exception; nonpublic school; and postsecondary
institution;
                             ­­
   (4) test results from the P r­­­s

                                       I subject area content test;
   (5) evidence of advanced certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards;
   (6) evidence of the successful completion of course work or pedagogy courses; and
   (7) evidence of the successful completion of high quality professional development activities.
    Districts must assign a school administrator to serve as a HOUSSE reviewer to meet with
teachers under this paragraph and, where appropriate, certify the teachers' applications. Teachers
satisfy the definition of highly qualified when the teachers receive at least 100 of the total number
of points used to measure the teachers' content expertise under clauses (1) to (7). Teachers may
acquire up to 50 points only in any one clause (1) to (7). Teachers may use the HOUSSE process
to satisfy the definition of highly qualified for more than one subject area.
   (c) Achievement of the HOUSSE criteria is not equivalent to a license. A teacher must obtain
permission from the Board of Teaching in order to teach in a public school."
   Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
   Amend the title accordingly
   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
   H.F. No. 2072 was read the third time, as amended, and placed on its final passage.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.531, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Seizure. (a) Property subject to forfeiture under sections 609.531 to 609.5318 may
be seized by the appropriate agency upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the
property. Property may be seized without process if:
   (1) the seizure is incident to a lawful arrest or a lawful search;
    (2) the property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state
in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this chapter; or
   (3) the appropriate agency has probable cause to believe that the delay occasioned by the
necessity to obtain process would result in the removal or destruction of the property and that:
   (i) the property was used or is intended to be used in commission of a felony; or
   (ii) the property is dangerous to health or safety.
    If property is seized without process under item (i), the county attorney must institute a forfeiture
action under section 609.5313 as soon as is reasonably possible.
    (b) When property is seized, the officer must provide a receipt to the person found in possession
of the property; or in the absence of any person, the officer must leave a receipt in the place where
the property was found, if reasonably possible.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to seizures conducted
on or after that date.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.531, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Right to possession vests immediately; custody of seized property. All right, title, and
interest in property subject to forfeiture under sections 609.531 to 609.5318 vests in the appropriate
agency upon commission of the act or omission giving rise to the forfeiture. Any property seized
under sections 609.531 to 609.5318 is not subject to replevin, but is deemed to be in the custody
of the appropriate agency subject to the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over
the forfeiture proceedings. When property is so seized, the appropriate agency shall use reasonable
diligence to secure the property and prevent waste and may do any of the following:
   (1) place the property under seal;
   (2) remove the property to a place designated by it; and
    (3) in the case of controlled substances, require the state Board of Pharmacy to take custody of
the property and remove it to an appropriate location for disposition in accordance with law;­­­

bond payable to the appropriate agency in an amount equal to the retail value of the seized property.
On posting the security or bond, the seized property must be returned to the owner and the forfeiture
action shall proceed against the security as if it were the seized property. This subdivision does not
apply to contraband property or property being held for investigatory purposes.
     (b) If the owner of a motor vehicle that has been seized under this section seeks possession of the
vehicle before the forfeiture action is determined, the owner may surrender the vehicle's certificate
of title in exchange for the vehicle. The motor vehicle must be returned to the owner within 24 hours
if the owner surrenders the motor vehicle's certificate of title to the appropriate agency, pending
resolution of the forfeiture action. If the certificate is surrendered, the owner may not be ordered to
post security or bond as a condition of release of the vehicle. When a certificate of title is surrendered
under this provision, the agency shall notify the Department of Public Safety and any secured party
noted on the certificate. The agency shall also notify the department and the secured party when it
returns a surrendered title to the motor vehicle owner.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.531, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Petition for remission or mitigation. Prior to the entry of a court order disposing
with the forfeiture action, any person who has an interest in forfeited property may file with the
county attorney a petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture. The county attorney may
remit or mitigate the forfeiture upon terms and conditions the county attorney deems reasonable if
the county attorney finds that: (1) the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without
any intention on the part of the petitioner to violate the law; or (2) extenuating circumstances justify
the remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.

    (c) Property used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common
carrier is subject to forfeiture under this section only if the owner of the property is a consenting
party to, or is privy to, the use or intended use of the property as described in subdivision 2.
    (d) Property is subject to forfeiture under this section only if its owner was privy to the use or
intended use described in subdivision 2, or the unlawful use or intended use of the property otherwise
occurred with the owner's knowledge or consent.
    (e) Forfeiture under this section of a conveyance device or real property encumbered by a bona
fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party unless the secured party had

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.5313, is amended to read:
   609.5313 FORFEITURE BY JUDICIAL ACTION; PROCEDURE.
    (a) The forfeiture of property under sections 609.5311 and 609.5312 is governed by this section.
A separate complaint must be filed against the property stating the act, omission, or occurrence
giving rise to the forfeiture and the date and place of the act or occurrence. Within 60 days from
when the seizure occurs, the county attorney shall notify the owner or possessor of the property of
the action, if known or readily ascertainable. The action must be captioned in the name of the county
attorney or the county attorney's designee as plaintiff and the property as defendant. Upon motion
by the county attorney, a court may extend the time period for sending notice for a period not to
exceed 90 days for good cause shown.
    (b) If notice is not sent in accordance with paragraph (a), and no time extension is granted or the
extension period has expired, the appropriate agency shall return the property to the person from
whom the property was seized, if known. An agency's return of property due to lack of proper notice
does not restrict the right of the agency to commence a forfeiture proceeding at a later time. The
agency shall not be required to return contraband or other property that the person from whom the
property was seized may not legally possess.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to offenses
committed on or after that date.

an ownership, possessory, or security interest in seized property must be notified of the seizure
and the intent to forfeit the property. In the case of a motor vehicle required to be registered under
chapter 168, notice mailed by certified mail to the address shown in Department of Public Safety
records is deemed sufficient notice to the registered owner. The notification to a person known
to have a security interest in seized property required under this paragraph applies only to motor
vehicles required to be registered under chapter 168 and only if the security interest is listed on the
vehicle's title. Upon motion by the appropriate agency or county attorney, a court may extend the
time period for sending notice for a period not to exceed 90 days for good cause shown.
    (b) Notice may otherwise be given in the manner provided by law for service of a summons in
a civil action. The notice must be in writing and contain:
   (1) a description of the property seized;

property is worth $15,000 or less, you may file your claim in conciliation court. You do not have to

    (c) If notice is not sent in accordance with paragraph (a), and no time extension is granted or the
extension period has expired, the appropriate agency shall return the property to the person from
whom the property was seized, if known. An agency's return of property due to lack of proper notice
does not restrict the right of the agency to commence a forfeiture proceeding at a later time. The
agency shall not be required to return contraband or other property that the person from whom the
property was seized may not legally possess.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to offenses
committed on or after that date.
     Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.5314, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Judicial determination. (a) Within 60 days following service of a notice of seizure
and forfeiture under this section, a claimant may file a demand for a judicial determination of the
forfeiture. The demand must be in the form of a civil complaint and must be filed with the court
administrator in the county in which the seizure occurred, together with proof of service of a copy
of the complaint on the county attorney for that county, and the standard filing fee for civil actions
unless the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the value of the
seized property is $7,500 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of
the seized property. If the value of the seized property is less than $500, the claimant does not have
to pay the conciliation court filing fee. No responsive pleading is required of the county attorney and
no court fees may be charged for the county attorney's appearance in the matter. The hearing must
be held at the earliest practicable date, and in any event no later than 180 days following the filing
of the demand by the claimant. If a related criminal proceeding is pending, the hearing shall not be
held until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The district court administrator shall schedule
the hearing as soon as practicable after adjudication in the criminal prosecution. The proceedings
are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (b) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
property as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges the

property was improperly seized and the plaintiff's interest in the property seized. Notwithstanding
any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this section may not be
maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with a notice of seizure and forfeiture
unless the person has complied with this subdivision.
    (c) If the claimant makes a timely demand for judicial determination under this subdivision,
the appropriate agency must conduct the forfeiture under section 609.531, subdivision 6a.
The limitations and defenses set forth in section 609.5311, subdivision 3, apply to the judicial
determination.
    (d) If a demand for judicial determination of an administrative forfeiture is filed under this
subdivision and the court orders the return of the seized property, the court shall order that filing
fees be reimbursed to the person who filed the demand. In addition, the court may order sanctions
under section 549.211. If the court orders payment of these costs, they must be paid from forfeited
money or proceeds from the sale of forfeited property from the appropriate law enforcement and
prosecuting agencies in the same proportion as they would be distributed under section 609.5315,
subdivision 5.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to offenses
committed on or after that date.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609.5315, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Disposition. (a) Subject to paragraph (b), if the court finds under section
609.5313, 609.5314, or 609.5318 that the property is subject to forfeiture, it shall order the
appropriate agency to do one of the following:
   (1) unless a different disposition is provided under clause (3) or (4), either destroy firearms,
ammunition, and firearm accessories that the agency decides not to use for law enforcement purposes
under clause (8), or sell them to federally licensed firearms dealers, as defined in section 624.7161,
subdivision 1, and distribute the proceeds under subdivision 5 or 5b;
    (2) sell property that is not required to be destroyed by law and is not harmful to the public and
distribute the proceeds under subdivision 5 or 5b;
    (3) sell antique firearms, as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 3, to the public and distribute
the proceeds under subdivision 5 or 5b;
    (4) destroy or use for law enforcement purposes semiautomatic military-style assault weapons,
as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 7;
   (5) take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law;
   (6) forward the property to the federal drug enforcement administration;
   (7) disburse money as provided under subdivision 5 or 5b; or
   (8) keep property other than money for official use by the agency and the prosecuting agency.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Hennepin or Ramsey County sheriff may not sell
firearms, ammunition, or firearms accessories if the policy is disapproved by the applicable county
board.

    (c) If property is sold under paragraph (a), the appropriate agency shall not sell property to an
officer or employee of the agency that seized the property or to a person related to the officer or
employee by blood or marriage.
  (d) Sales of forfeited property under this section must be conducted in a commercially reasonable
manner.

training. Certification shall be revoked if the certified person is convicted of violating any of the
statutes or rules governing testing for aquatic species diseases. Certification may be suspended
during an investigation associated with misconduct or violations of fish health testing and collection.
The commissioner shall notify the person that certification is being revoked or suspended.
    Subd. 3. Conflict of interest. A fish collector may not oversee the collection of fish from a
facility or a water body when the collector has a conflict of interest in connection with the outcome
of the testing.

    (b) An aquatic farm propagating any species on the viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS)
susceptible list and having an effluent discharge from the aquatic farm into public waters must
test for VHS virus using the guidelines of the Fish Health Blue Book or the Diagnostic Manual
for Aquatic Animal Diseases, published by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The
commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, prescribe alternative testing
time periods and methods from those prescribed in the Fish Health Blue Book or the OIE Diagnostic
Manual if the commissioner determines that biosecurity measures will not be compromised. These
alternatives are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does
not apply. The commissioner must provide reasonable notice to affected parties of any changes in
testing requirements.
    (c) Results of fish health inspections must be provided to the commissioner for all fish that remain
in the state. All data used to prepare and issue a fish health certificate must be maintained for three
years by the issuing fish health inspector, approved laboratory, or accredited veterinarian.
    (d) A health inspection fee must be charged based on each lot of fish sampled. The fee by check
or money order payable to the Department of Natural Resources must be prepaid or paid at the time
a bill or notice is received from the commissioner that the inspection and processing of samples is
completed.

      ) (e) Upon receipt of payment and completion of inspection, the commissioner shall notify
the operator and issue a fish health certificate. The certification must be made according to the Fish
Health Blue Book by a person certified as a fish health inspector.

    (d
     ­­) (f) All aquatic life in transit or held at transfer stations within the state may be inspected by
the commissioner. This inspection may include the collection of stock for purposes of pathological
analysis. Sample size necessary for analysis will follow guidelines listed in the Fish Health Blue
Book.

      ) (g) Salmonids and catfish must have a fish health inspection before being transported from
a containment facility, unless the fish are being transported directly to an outlet for processing or
other food purposes or unless the commissioner determines that an inspection is not needed. A fish
health inspection conducted for this purpose need only be done on the lot or lots of fish that will
be transported. The commissioner must conduct a fish health inspection requested for this purpose
within five working days of receiving written notice. Salmonids and catfish may be immediately
transported from a containment facility to another containment facility once a sample has been
obtained for a health inspection or once the five-day notice period has expired.

by the licensee, new requests for eggs, and the condition of the spawning runs at those historical
streams and rivers that have produced previous annual quotas.

paragraphs (d) and (f), every person owning or controlling any domestic animal that has died or
been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption, shall as soon
as reasonably possible bury the carcass at a depth adequate to prevent scavenging by other animals
in the ground or thoroughly burn it or dispose of it by another method approved by the board as
being effective for the protection of public health and the control of livestock diseases. The board,
through its executive director, may issue permits to owners of rendering plants located in Minnesota
which are operated and conducted as required by law, to transport carcasses of domestic animals and
fowl that have died, or have been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal
consumption, over the public highways to their plants for rendering purposes in accordance with
the rules adopted by the board relative to transportation, rendering, and other provisions the board
considers necessary to prevent the spread of disease. The board may issue permits to owners of
rendering plants located in an adjacent state with which a reciprocal agreement is in effect under
subdivision 3.
     (b) Carcasses collected by rendering plants under permit may be used for pet food or mink food
if the owner or operator meets the requirements of subdivision 1b.
    (c) An authorized employee or agent of the board may enter private or public property and inspect
the carcass of any domestic animal that has died or has been killed other than by being slaughtered
for human or animal consumption. Failure to dispose of the carcass of any domestic animal within
the period specified by this subdivision is a public nuisance. The board may petition the district court
of the county in which a carcass is located for a writ requiring the abatement of the public nuisance.
A civil action commenced under this paragraph does not preclude a criminal prosecution under this
section. No person may sell, offer to sell, give away, or convey along a public road or on land the
person does not own, the carcass of a domestic animal when the animal died or was killed other
than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption unless it is done with a special permit
pursuant to this section. The carcass or parts of a domestic animal that has died or has been killed
other than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption may be transported along a public
road for a medical or scientific purpose if the carcass is enclosed in a leakproof container to prevent
spillage or the dripping of liquid waste. The board may adopt rules relative to the transportation
of the carcass of any domestic animal for a medical or scientific purpose. A carcass on a public
thoroughfare may be transported for burial or other disposition in accordance with this section.
   No person who owns or controls diseased animals shall negligently or willfully permit them to
escape from that control or to run at large.
   (d) A sheep producer may compost sheep carcasses owned by the producer on the producer's
land without a permit and is exempt from compost facility specifications contained in rules of the
board.

   (e) The board shall develop best management practices for dead animal disposal and the
Pollution Control Agency feedlot program shall distribute them to livestock producers in the state.
    (f) Paragraph (a) does not apply to livestock killed by wild animals or domestic dogs and the
carcass is out-of-sight of the public, and will be used to attract the offending predators back to the
kill site.

policy committees with recommendations for changes to this subdivision that are necessary for the
stream easement payment rates to reflect current shoreland market values. The recommendations
may include an adjustment to the dollar amount in paragraph (a), clause (1).

year's state employee campaign is $100. These fees must be credited to an account in the special
revenue fund and are appropriated to the commissioner to be expended with the approval of the
Combined Charities Board in section 43A.04 for costs associated with administering the annual
campaign.
   The commissioner may require submission of additional information needed to determine
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
    (c) The commissioner shall register or not register the application of an organization and shall
notify the organization of the decision by May 1. An organization whose application is denied has
ten calendar days after receiving notice of the denial to appeal the decision or file an amended
application correcting the deficiency. The commissioner shall register or not register the organization
within ten calendar days after receiving the appeal or amended application. If registration is denied
a second time, the organization may appeal within five calendar days after receiving notice of the
denial. A hearing shall be scheduled by the commissioner and shall be held within 15 calendar days
after receiving notice of the appeal. The parties may mutually agree to a later date. The provisions
of chapter 14 do not apply to the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted in a manner considered
appropriate by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination within five calendar
days after the hearing has been completed.
   (d) Only organizations that are approved may participate in the state employee combined
charities campaign for the year of approval and only contributions to approved organizations may
be deducted from an employee's pay pursuant to section 16A.134.

President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 3729 report that we have agreed upon the items in

    Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
                                                        "ARTICLE 1

in which the tax is payable and may include a portion of the balance in the state airports fund as
determined to be available by the commissioner of transportation. ­                      I­

273.111, subdivision 3.
   (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), and subdivision 9, paragraph (b), when property assessed
under this subdivision is withdrawn from the program or becomes ineligible, the property shall be
subject to additional taxes as provided in subdivision 9.
    (c) If land described in paragraph (a) is (1) sold or otherwise transferred to a son or daughter of

    Subd. 4. Determination of value. (a) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3
shall upon timely application by the owner, in the manner provided in subdivision 8, be determined
solely with reference to its appropriate agricultural classification and value notwithstanding
sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any
added values resulting from nonagricultural factors. In order to account for the presence of
nonagricultural influences that may affect the value of agricultural land, the commissioner of
revenue shall, in consultation with the Department of Applied Economics at the University of
Minnesota, develop a fair and uniform method of determining ­       ag

county, and these values shall be used as the basis for determining the agricultural value for all
properties in the county qualifying for tax deferment under this section. The county assessor, in
consultation with the Department of Revenue, shall determine the relative value of agricultural
land for each assessment district in comparison to the countywide average value, considering and
giving recognition to appropriate agricultural market and soil data available.
    (b) In the case of property qualifying for tax deferment only under subdivision 3a, the assessor
shall not consider the presence of commercial, industrial, residential, or seasonal recreational land
use influences in determining the value for ad valorem tax purposes provided that in no case shall
the value exceed the value prescribed by the commissioner of revenue for class 2a tillable property
in that county.

a partnership operating a family farm and leased to the family farm corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, or joint farm venture, as defined in paragraph (a), is eligible for classification
as class 1b or class 2a under section 273.13, if the owner is actually residing on the property, and
is actually engaged in farming the land on behalf of that corporation, joint farm venture, limited
liability company, or partnership. This paragraph applies without regard to any legal possession
rights of the family farm corporation, joint family farm venture, limited liability company, or
partnership under the lease.
    (d) Agricultural property that (1) is owned by a family farm corporation, joint farm venture,
limited liability company, or partnership and (2) is contiguous to a class 2a homestead under section
273.13, subdivision 23, or if noncontiguous, is located in the same township or city, or not farther
than four townships or cities, or combination thereof from a class 2a homestead, and the class 2a
homestead is owned by one of the shareholders, members, or partners; is entitled to receive the first
tier homestead class rate up to the first tier maximum market value on any remaining market value

   (1) the parcel on which the house is located is contiguous on at least two sides to (i) agricultural
land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause
(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this
paragraph for the 1998 assessment.
   (b)(i) Agricultural property shall be classified as the owner's homestead, to the same extent as
other agricultural homestead property, if all of the following criteria are met:
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                       11935

    (1) the property consists of at least 40 acres including undivided government lots and correctional
40's;
    (2) the owner, the owner's spouse, the son or daughter of the owner or owner's spouse, the brother
or sister of the owner or owner's spouse, or the grandson or granddaughter of the owner or the
owner's spouse, is actively farming the agricultural property, either on the person's own behalf as
an individual or on behalf of a partnership operating a family farm, family farm corporation, joint
family farm venture, or limited liability company of which the person is a partner, shareholder, or
member;
    (3) both the owner of the agricultural property and the person who is actively farming the
agricultural property under clause (2), are Minnesota residents;
   (4) neither the owner nor the spouse of the owner claims another agricultural homestead in
Minnesota; and
    (5) neither the owner nor the person actively farming the property lives farther than four
townships or cities, or a combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property,
except that if the owner or the owner's spouse is required to live in employer-provided housing,
the owner or owner's spouse, whichever is actively farming the agricultural property, may live
more than four townships or cities, or combination of four townships or cities from the agricultural
property.
   The relationship under this paragraph may be either by blood or marriage.
    (ii) Real property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for agricultural homestead
classification under this paragraph if the qualifications in clause (i) are met, except that "owner"
means the grantor of the trust.
     (iii) Property containing the residence of an owner who owns qualified property under clause
(i) shall be classified as part of the owner's agricultural homestead, if that property is also used for
noncommercial storage or drying of agricultural crops.
    (c) Noncontiguous land shall be included as part of a homestead under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), only if the homestead is classified as class 2a and the detached land
is located in the same township or city, or not farther than four townships or cities or combination
thereof from the homestead. Any taxpayer of these noncontiguous lands must notify the county
assessor that the noncontiguous land is part of the taxpayer's homestead, and, if the homestead is
located in another county, the taxpayer must also notify the assessor of the other county.
    (d) Agricultural land used for purposes of a homestead and actively farmed by a person holding
a vested remainder interest in it must be classified as a homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a). If agricultural land is classified class 2a, any other dwellings on the land used for
purposes of a homestead by persons holding vested remainder interests who are actively engaged
in farming the property, and up to one acre of the land surrounding each homestead and reasonably
necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home, must also be assessed class 2a.
   (e) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1997 assessment shall remain classified as agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:

purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 30 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 1997 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the

uninhabited.
   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead

    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to a March 29, 1998,
tornado, and the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in
verifying the change in homestead dwelling. For taxes payable in 1999, the owner must notify the
assessor by December 1, 1998. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property
continues to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land
remain uninhabited.
    (g) Agricultural property of a family farm corporation, joint family farm venture, family farm
limited liability company, or partnership operating a family farm as described under subdivision 8
shall be classified homestead, to the same extent as other agricultural homestead property, if all of
the following criteria are met:
    (1) the property consists of at least 40 acres including undivided government lots and correctional
40's;
   (2) a shareholder, member, or partner of that entity is actively farming the agricultural property;
   (3) that shareholder, member, or partner who is actively farming the agricultural property is a

Minnesota resident;
    (4) neither that shareholder, member, or partner, nor the spouse of that shareholder, member, or
partner claims another agricultural homestead in Minnesota; and
   (5) that shareholder, member, or partner does not live farther than four townships or cities, or a
combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property.
    Homestead treatment applies under this paragraph for property leased to a family farm
corporation, joint farm venture, limited liability company, or partnership operating a family farm if
legal title to the property is in the name of an individual who is a member, shareholder, or partner
in the entity.
    (h) To be eligible for the special agricultural homestead under this subdivision, an initial full
application must be submitted to the county assessor where the property is located. Owners and
the persons who are actively farming the property shall be required to complete only a one-page
abbreviated version of the application in each subsequent year provided that none of the following
items have changed since the initial application:
   (1) the day-to-day operation, administration, and financial risks remain the same;
   (2) the owners and the persons actively farming the property continue to live within the four
townships or city criteria and are Minnesota residents;
   (3) the same operator of the agricultural property is listed with the Farm Service Agency;
   (4) a Schedule F or equivalent income tax form was filed for the most recent year;
   (5) the property's acreage is unchanged; and
    (6) none of the property's acres have been enrolled in a federal or state farm program since the
initial application.
    The owners and any persons who are actively farming the property must include the appropriate
Social Security numbers, and sign and date the application. If any of the specified information has
changed since the full application was filed, the owner must notify the assessor, and must complete
a new application to determine if the property continues to qualify for the special agricultural
homestead. The commissioner of revenue shall prepare a standard reapplication form for use by
the assessors.
   (i) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 2007 assessment shall remain classified agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of damage caused by the August 2007 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Dodge, Fillmore, Houston, Olmsted, Steele, Wabasha,
or Winona;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 2007 assessment year;
11938                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [106TH DAY

    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in this state and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the August 2007 floods,
and the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying
the change in homestead dwelling. For taxes payable in 2009, the owner must notify the assessor
by December 1, 2008. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (j) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 2008 assessment shall remain classified as agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of the March 2009 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Marshall;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 2008 assessment year and continue to be used for agricultural
purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 2009 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the
change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessment years 2010 and 2011, for taxes
payable in 2011 and 2012.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 273.13, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by:
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse;
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                        11939

   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse; or
    (3) the surviving spouse of a permanently and totally disabled veteran homesteading a property
classified under this paragraph for taxes payable in 2008.
    Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph, and that the property is not eligible
for the valuation exclusion under subdivision 34.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
    (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250
days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead
by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation
that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited
liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a
commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used
exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential
occupancy. Class 1c property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined
as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with
water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational
activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or
cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell
bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the property is transferred to an individual
or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class 1c even
though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that otherwise
qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the
use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. If an owner of property that had been classified
as class 1c ceases to use that property as a homestead but retains ownership of that property and
continues to operate it as a resort, and begins to occupy a second property that is located in the
same township as the original class 1c property, both properties will be assessed as a single class
1c property, provided that the second property would separately qualify to be assessed as class 1c
property. The portion of the property used as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a).
The remainder of the property is classified as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier I,
the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class
rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent; tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of
real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation
11940                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [106TH DAY

purposes in which all or a portion of the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not
more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c,
must submit a declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days
or less in the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those
cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated
as class 1c as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share
of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of
property desiring designation as class 1c property must provide guest registers or other records
demonstrating that the units for which class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5)
other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2010, payable in 2011, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) An agricultural homestead consists of class 2a agricultural land that is
homesteaded, along with any class 2b rural vacant land that is contiguous to the class 2a land under
the same ownership. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one
acre of land has the same class rates as class 1a or 1b property under subdivision 22. The value of the
remaining land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead
property has a net class rate of 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first
tier has a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier
valuation limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under
section 273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2a agricultural land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
agricultural land and buildings. Class 2a property has a net class rate of one percent of market
106TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                      11941

value, unless it is part of an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a). Class 2a property must
also include any property that would otherwise be classified as 2b, but is interspersed with class
2a property, including but not limited to sloughs, wooded wind shelters, acreage abutting ditches,
ravines, rock piles, land subject to a setback requirement, and other similar land that is impractical
for the assessor to value separately from the rest of the property or that is unlikely to be able to
be sold separately from the rest of the property.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this subdivision that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 2a and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use.
    (c) Class 2b rural vacant land consists of parcels of property, or portions thereof, that are
unplatted real estate, rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes, including land
used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, that is not improved
with a structure. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
Any parcel of 20 acres or more improved with a structure that is not a minor, ancillary nonresidential
structure must be split-classified, and ten acres must be assigned to the split parcel containing the
structure. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value unless it is part of
an agricultural homestead under paragraph (a), or qualifies as class 2c under paragraph (d).
    (d) Class 2c managed forest land consists of no less than 20 and no more than 1,920 acres
statewide per taxpayer that is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the
requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management
incentive program. It has a class rate of .65 percent, provided that the owner of the property must
apply to the assessor in order for the property to initially qualify for the reduced rate and provide
the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
If the assessor receives the application and information before May 1 in an assessment year, the
property qualifies beginning with that assessment year. If the assessor receives the application
and information after April 30 in an assessment year, the property may not qualify until the next
assessment year. The commissioner of natural resources must concur that the land is qualified. The
commissioner of natural resources shall annually provide county assessors verification information
on a timely basis. The presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure as defined by the
commissioner of revenue does not disqualify the property from classification under this paragraph.
    (e) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more, used
during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this section
means the raising, cultivation, drying, or storage of agricultural products for sale, or the storage
of machinery or equipment used in support of agricultural production by the same farm entity.
For a property to be classified as agricultural based only on the drying or storage of agricultural
products, the products being dried or stored must have been produced by the same farm entity as the
entity operating the drying or storage facility. "Agricultural purposes" also includes enrollment in
the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or the federal Conservation
Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state or federal conservation
program if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment
year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Agricultural classification shall not be based
upon the market value of any residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the
same ownership.
   (f) Real estate of less than ten acres, which is exclusively or intensively used for raising or
11942                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [106TH DAY

cultivating agricultural products, shall be considered as agricultural land. To qualify under this
paragraph, property that includes a residential structure must be used intensively for one of the
following purposes:
    (i) for drying or storage of grain or storage of machinery or equipment used to support
agricultural activities on other parcels of property operated by the same farming entity;
    (ii) as a nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce nursery stock are considered
agricultural land;
   (iii) for livestock or poultry confinement, provided that land that is used only for pasturing and
grazing does not qualify; or
    (iv) for market farming; for purposes of this paragraph, "market farming" means the cultivation
of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other agricultural products for sale to
local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer is affiliated.
   (g) Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    (h) The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (i) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses, which may include related horse training and riding

pasture to graze horses or raising or cultivating other agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
106TH DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                        11943

    (j) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    (k) The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (l) Class 2d airport landing area consists of a landing area or public access area of a privately
owned public use airport. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for
classification under this paragraph, a privately owned public use airport must be licensed as a
public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of this paragraph, "landing area" means that part
of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared, regularly maintained, and made available
to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways, taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are
situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area also includes land underlying both the primary
surface and the approach surfaces that comply with all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under this paragraph must be described and certified by the
commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the airport
or landing area no longer meets the requirements of this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph,
"public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp, apron, or storage hangar, or
an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    (m) Class 2e consists of land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being
mined and is not otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, provided that the land is not located in a county
that has elected to opt-out of the aggregate preservation program as provided in section 273.1115,
11944                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [106TH DAY

subdivision 6. It has a class rate of one percent of market value. To qualify for classification under
this paragraph, the property must be at least ten contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property
must record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located an affidavit
containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (n) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
   (o) The definitions prescribed by the commissioner under paragraphs (c) and (d) are not rules
and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions in section 14.386
concerning exempt rules do not apply.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2011 and thereafter.

    (1) nonhomestead residential real estate containing one unit, other than seasonal residential
recreational property; and
   (2) a single family dwelling, garage, and surrounding one acre of property on a nonhomestead

which it has been owned by the current owner or spouse of the current owner does not qualify for
class 4bb.
   (d) Class 4c property includes:
    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), real and personal property devoted to
temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes, including real and personal
property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes and
not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of
assessment. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific
day if any portion of the property is used for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for
residential occupancy. Class 4c property under this clause must contain three or more rental units.
A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual
camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 4c
property under this clause must provide recreational activities such as renting ice fishing houses,
boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services,
launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad offered for
rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c under this clause is also class 4c under
this clause regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad
does not exceed 250 days. In order for a property to be classified as class 4c, seasonal residential
recreational for commercial purposes under this clause, at least 40 percent of the annual gross
lodging receipts related to the property must be from business conducted during 90 consecutive
days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the year must

receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill
or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina services, launch services, and guide services,
11946                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [106TH DAY

more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c property classified under this clause also
includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes in conjunction
with other class 4c property classified under this clause and devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property
is not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the

the year preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or
units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c
under this clause as otherwise provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate
share of the land on which they are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property
desiring designation as class 4c property under this clause must provide guest registers or other
records demonstrating that the units for which class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for
more than 250 days in the year preceding the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property
operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3) gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5)
other nonresidential facility operated on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and
seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c;

course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit
community service oriented organization and not used for residential purposes on either a

   (ii) the organization makes annual charitable contributions and donations at least equal to the
property's previous year's property taxes and the property is allowed to be used for public and

   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in
the case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. The notice must
clearly state for each city, county, school district, regional library authority established under section
134.201, and metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), the time and place of the
taxing authorities' regularly scheduled meetings in which the budget and levy will be discussed and

must provide the county auditor with the information to be included in the notice on or before the
time it certifies its proposed levy under subdivision 1. The public must be allowed to speak at the
meetings and the meetings shall not be held before 6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number
for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions related to the notice and
an address where comments will be received by mail, except that no notice required under this
section shall be interpreted as requiring the printing of a personal telephone number or address as
the contact information for a taxing authority. If a taxing authority does not maintain public offices
where telephone calls can be received by the authority, the authority may inform the county of the
11950                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [106TH DAY

authority.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:

property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net

levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
   (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                        11951

   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
     (2) population growth and decline;
     (3) state or federal government action; and

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 276.02, is amended to read:
   276.02 TREASURER TO BE COLLECTOR.
     The county treasurer shall collect all taxes extended on the tax lists of the county and the fines,
forfeitures, or penalties received by any person or officer for the use of the county. The treasurer shall
collect the taxes according to law and credit them to the proper funds. This section does not apply
to fines and penalties accruing to municipal corporations for the violation of their ordinances that
are recoverable before a city justice. Taxes, fines, interest, and penalties must be paid with United
States currency or by check o   ­­r, money order, or electronic payments, including, but not limited
to, automated clearing house transactions and federal wires drawn on a bank or other financial
institution in the United States. The county board may by resolution authorize the treasurer to impose
a charge for any dishonored checks or electronic payments. The charges for dishonored payment of
property taxes may be added to the tax, shall constitute a lien on the property, and when collected
shall be distributed to the county.
    The county board may, by resolution, authorize the treasurer and/or other designees to accept
payments of real property taxes by credit card provided that a fee is charged for its use. The fee
charged must be commensurate with the costs assessed by the card issuer. If a credit card transaction
under this section is subsequently voided or otherwise reversed, the lien of real property taxes under
section 272.31 is revived and attaches in the manner and time provided in that section as though the

     Subdivision 1. Due dates; penalties. Except as provided in subdivision 3 or 4, on May 16 or
21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is
later, a penalty accrues and thereafter is charged upon all unpaid taxes on real estate on the current
lists in the hands of the county treasurer. The penalty is at a rate of two percent on homestead
property until May 31 and four percent on June 1. The penalty on nonhomestead property is at a
rate of four percent until May 31 and eight percent on June 1. This penalty does not accrue until
June 1 of each year, or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property
tax statements, whichever is later, on commercial use real property used for seasonal residential
recreational purposes and classified as class 1c or 4c, and on other commercial use real property
classified as class 3a, provided that over 60 percent of the gross income earned by the enterprise on
the class 3a property is earned during the months of May, June, July, and August. In order for the first
half of the tax due on class 3a property to be paid after May 15 and before June 1, or 21 days after
the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is later, without
penalty, the owner of the property must attach an affidavit to the payment attesting to compliance
with the income provision of this subdivision. Thereafter, for both homestead and nonhomestead
property, on the first day of each month beginning July 1, up to and including October 1 following,
an additional penalty of one percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes
provided that if the due date was extended beyond May 15 as the result of any delay in mailing
property tax statements no additional penalty shall accrue if the tax is paid by the extended due date.
If the tax is not paid by the extended due date, then all penalties that would have accrued if the due

one-half thereof may be paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope
containing the property tax statement, whichever is later; and, if so paid, no penalty attaches; the
remaining one-half may be paid at any time prior to October 16 following, without penalty; but,
if not so paid, then a penalty of two percent accrues thereon for homestead property and a penalty
of four percent on nonhomestead property. Thereafter, for homestead property, on the first day of
November an additional penalty of four percent accrues and on the first day of December following,
an additional penalty of two percent accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. Thereafter,
for nonhomestead property, on the first day of November and December following, an additional
penalty of four percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. If one-half of
such taxes are not paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing
the property tax statement, whichever is later, the same may be paid at any time prior to October
16, with accrued penalties to the date of payment added, and thereupon no penalty attaches to the
remaining one-half until October 16 following.
    This section applies to payment of personal property taxes assessed against improvements to
leased property, except as provided by section 277.01, subdivision 3.
    A county may provide by resolution that in the case of a property owner that has multiple tracts

provided in this subdivision.
     The county treasurer may accept payments of more or less than the exact amount of a tax
installment due. Payments must be applied first to the oldest installment that is due but which
has not been fully paid. If the accepted payment is less than the amount due, payments must be
applied first to the penalty accrued for the year or the installment being paid. Acceptance of partial
payment of tax does not constitute a waiver of the minimum payment required as a condition for
filing an appeal under section 278.03 or any other law, nor does it affect the order of payment of
delinquent taxes under section 280.39.

  Sec. 3. [270C.991] PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM BENCHMARKS AND CRITICAL
INDICATORS.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose. State policy makers should be provided with the tools to create a more
accountable and efficient property tax system. This section provides the principles and available
tools necessary to work toward achieving that goal.
11962                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [106TH DAY

   Subd. 2. Property tax principles. To better evaluate the various property tax proposals that come
before the legislature, the following basic property tax principles should be taken into consideration.
The property taxes proposed should be:
   (1) transparent and understandable;
   (2) simple and efficient;
   (3) equitable;
   (4) stable and predictable;
   (5) compliance and accountability;
   (6) competitive, both nationally and globally; and
   (7) responsive to economic conditions.
    Subd. 3. Major indicators. There are many different types of indicators available to legislators
to evaluate tax legislation. Indicators are useful to have available as benchmarks when legislators
are contemplating changes. Each tool has its own limitation, and no one tool is perfect or should be
used independently. Some of the tools measure the global characteristics of the entire tax system,
while others are only a measure of the property tax impacts and its administration. The following is
a list of the available major indicators:
    (1) property tax principles scale, the components of which are listed in subdivision 2, as they
relate to the various features of the property tax system;
   (2) price of government report, as required under section 16A.102;
   (3) tax incidence report, as required under section 270C.13;
   (4) tax expenditure budget and report, as required under section 270C.11;
   (5) state tax rankings;
    (6) property tax levy plus aid data, and market value and net tax capacity data, by taxing district
for current and past years;
    (7) effective tax rate (tax as a percent of market value) and the equalized effective tax rate
(effective tax rate adjusted for assessment differences);
   (8) assessment sales ratio study, as required under section 127A.48;
   (9) "Voss" database, which matches homeowner property taxes and household income;
   (10) revenue estimates under section 270C.11, subdivision 5, and state fiscal notes under section
477A.03, subdivision 2b; and
   (11) local impact notes under section 3.987.
   Subd. 4. Property tax working group. (a) A property tax working group is established as
provided in this subdivision. The goals of the working group are:
   (1) to investigate ways to simplify the property tax system and make advisory recommendations
106TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                     11963

on ways to make the system more understandable;
    (2) to reexamine the property tax calendar to determine what changes could be made to shorten
the two-year cycle from assessment through property tax collection; and
    (3) to determine the cost versus the benefits of the various property tax components, including
property classifications, credits, aids, exclusions, exemptions, and abatements, and to suggest ways
to achieve some of the goals in simpler and more cost-efficient ways.
   (b) The 13-member working group shall consist of the following members:
  (1) two state representatives, both appointed by the chair of the house of representatives Taxes
Committee, one from the majority party and one from the largest minority party;
  (2) two senators appointed by the Subcommittee on Committees of the Senate Rules and
Administration Committee, one from the majority party and one from the largest minority party;
   (3) the commissioner of revenue, or designee;
   (4) one person appointed by the Association of Minnesota Counties;
   (5) one person appointed by the League of Minnesota Cities;
   (6) one person appointed by the Minnesota Association of Townships;
   (7) one person appointed by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce;
   (8) one person appointed by the Minnesota Association of Assessing Officers;
   (9) two homeowners, one who is under 65 years of age, and one who is 65 years of age or older,
both appointed by the commissioner of revenue; and
   (10) one person jointly appointed by the Minnesota Farm Bureau and the Minnesota Farmers
Union.
    The commissioner of revenue shall chair the initial meeting, and the working group shall elect
a chair at that initial meeting. The working group will meet at the call of the chair. Members of
the working group shall serve without compensation. The commissioner of revenue must provide
administrative support to the working group. Chapter 13D does not apply to meetings of the working
group. Meetings of the working group must be open to the public and the working group must
provide notice of a meeting to potentially interested persons at least seven days before the meeting.
A meeting of the council occurs when a quorum is present.
    (c) The working group shall make its advisory recommendations to the chairs of the house of
representatives and senate Taxes Committees on or before February 1, 2012, at which time the
working group shall be finished and this subdivision expires. The advisory recommendations should
be reviewed by the Taxes Committee under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 5. Taxes Committee review and resolution. On or before March 1, 2012, and every
two years thereafter, the house of representatives and senate Taxes Committees must review the
major indicators as contained in subdivision 3, and ascertain the accountability and efficiency of
the property tax system. The house of representatives and senate Taxes Committees shall prepare a
resolution on targets and benchmarks for use during the current biennium.
11964                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [106TH DAY

    Subd. 6. Department of Revenue; revenue estimates. As provided under section 270C.11,
subdivision 5, the Department of Revenue is required to prepare an estimate of the effect on the
state's tax revenues which result from the passage of a legislative bill establishing, extending, or
restricting a tax expenditure. Beginning with the 2011 legislative session, those revenue estimates
must also identify how the property tax principles contained in subdivision 2 apply to the proposed
tax changes. The commissioner of revenue shall develop a scale for measuring the appropriate
principles for each proposed change. The department shall quantify the effects, if possible, or at
a minimum, shall identify the relevant factors so that legislators are aware of possible outcomes,
including administrative difficulties and cost. The interaction of property tax shifting should be
identified and quantified to the degree possible.
    Subd. 7. Appropriation. The sum of $30,000 in fiscal year 2011 and $25,000 in each fiscal year
thereafter is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue to carry out the
commissioner's added responsibilities under subdivision 6.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
                                            ARTICLE 3
               INCOME, CORPORATE FRANCHISE, AND ESTATE TAXES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.08, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Composite income tax returns for nonresident partners, shareholders, and
beneficiaries. (a) The commissioner may allow a partnership with nonresident partners to file a
composite return and to pay the tax on behalf of nonresident partners who have no other Minnesota
source income. This composite return must include the names, addresses, Social Security numbers,
income allocation, and tax liability for the nonresident partners electing to be covered by the
composite return.
    (b) The computation of a partner's tax liability must be determined by multiplying the income
allocated to that partner by the highest rate used to determine the tax liability for individuals
under section 290.06, subdivision 2c. Nonbusiness deductions, standard deductions, or personal
exemptions are not allowed.
    (c) The partnership must submit a request to use this composite return filing method for
nonresident partners. The requesting partnership must file a composite return in the form prescribed
by the commissioner of revenue. The filing of a composite return is considered a request to use the
composite return filing method.
    (d) The electing partner must not have any Minnesota source income other than the income from
the partnership and other electing partnerships. If it is determined that the electing partner has other
Minnesota source income, the inclusion of the income and tax liability for that partner under this
provision will not constitute a return to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 1. The tax paid for
the individual as part of the composite return is allowed as a payment of the tax by the individual
on the date on which the composite return payment was made. If the electing nonresident partner
has no other Minnesota source income, filing of the composite return is a return for purposes of
subdivision 1.
    (e) This subdivision does not negate the requirement that an individual pay estimated tax if
the individual's liability would exceed the requirements set forth in section 289A.25. A composite
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                        11965

estimate may, however, be filed in a manner similar to and containing the information required under
paragraph (a).
    (f) If an electing partner's share of the partnership's gross income from Minnesota sources is
less than the filing requirements for a nonresident under this subdivision, the tax liability is zero.
However, a statement showing the partner's share of gross income must be included as part of the
composite return.
    (g) The election provided in this subdivision is only available to a partner who has no other
Minnesota source income and who is either (1) a full-year nonresident individual or (2) a trust or
estate that does not claim a deduction under either section 651 or 661 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (h) A corporation defined in section 290.9725 and its nonresident shareholders may make an
election under this paragraph. The provisions covering the partnership apply to the corporation and
the provisions applying to the partner apply to the shareholder.
    (i) Estates and trusts distributing current income only and the nonresident individual
beneficiaries of the estates or trusts may make an election under this paragraph. The provisions
covering the partnership apply to the estate or trust. The provisions applying to the partner apply to
the beneficiary.
     (j) For the purposes of this subdivision, "income" means the partner's share of federal adjusted
gross income from the partnership modified by the additions provided in section 290.01, subdivision
19a, clauses (6) to (10), and the subtractions provided in: (i) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause
­
(9
 ­­) (8), to the extent the amount is assignable or allocable to Minnesota under section 290.17; and
(ii) section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause ­  (1
                                                 ­4­­
                                                    ) (13). The subtraction allowed under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause ­  (9
                            ­­
                             ) (8), is only allowed on the composite tax computation to the extent the
electing partner would have been allowed the subtraction.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.09, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Withholding statement. (a) A person required to deduct and withhold from an
employee a tax under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or 290.923, subdivision 2, or who
would have been required to deduct and withhold a tax under section 290.92, subdivision 2a or
3, or persons required to withhold tax under section 290.923, subdivision 2, determined without
regard to section 290.92, subdivision 19, if the employee or payee had claimed no more than one
withholding exemption, or who paid wages or made payments not subject to withholding under
section 290.92, subdivision 2a or 3, or 290.923, subdivision 2, to an employee or person receiving
royalty payments in excess of $600, or who has entered into a voluntary withholding agreement
with a payee under section 290.92, subdivision 20, must give every employee or person receiving
royalty payments in respect to the remuneration paid by the person to the employee or person
receiving royalty payments during the calendar year, on or before January 31 of the succeeding
year, or, if employment is terminated before the close of the calendar year, within 30 days after
the date of receipt of a written request from the employee if the 30-day period ends before January

    (b) The statement required to be furnished by paragraph (a) with respect to any remuneration
must be furnished at those times, must contain the information required, and must be in the form
the commissioner prescribes.
   (c) The commissioner may prescribe rules providing for reasonable extensions of time, not in

payees under this subdivision.
    (d) A duplicate of any statement made under this subdivision and in accordance with rules
prescribed by the commissioner, along with a reconciliation in the form the commissioner prescribes

to be filed under subdivision 1, must be filed with the commissioner on or before February 28 of the
year after the payments were made.
    (e) If an employer cancels the employer's Minnesota withholding account number required by
section 290.92, subdivision 24, the information required by paragraph (d), must be filed with the
commissioner within 30 days of the end of the quarter in which the employer cancels its account
number.
     (f) The employer must submit the statements required to be sent to the commissioner in the
same manner required to satisfy the federal reporting requirements of section 6011(e) of the
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued under it. F                        ­­o­

      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.30, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Estate tax. Where good cause exists, the commissioner may extend the time for
payment of estate tax for a period of not more than six months. If an extension to pay the federal
estate tax has been granted under section 6161 of the Internal Revenue Code, the time for payment
of the estate tax without penalty is extended for that period. A taxpayer who owes at least $5,000
in taxes and who, under section 6161 or 6166 of the Internal Revenue Code has been granted
an extension for payment of the tax shown on the return, may elect to pay the tax due to the
commissioner in equal amounts at the same time as required for federal purposes. A taxpayer
electing to pay the tax in installments shall defer a percentage of tax that does not exceed the
percentage of federal tax deferred and must notify the commissioner in writing no later than nine
months after the death of the person whose estate is subject to taxation. If the taxpayer fails to pay
an installment on time, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause, the election is
revoked and the entire amount of unpaid tax plus accrued interest is due and payable 90 days after
the date on which the installment was payable.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.50, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

filed.

notification provided under this subdivision is considered the date that the refund is paid for purposes
of the payment of interest under section 289A.56 and is considered the date of issuance of the original
warrant or check for purposes of issuing a new warrant or check under section 270C.347.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.60, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Penalty for frivolous return. If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return or a
claim for refund but which does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the
purported return or claim for refund may be judged or contains information that on its face shows
that the purported return or claim for refund is substantially incorrect and the conduct is due to a
position that is frivolous or a desire that appears on the purported return or claim for refund to delay
or impede the administration of Minnesota tax laws, then the ­n  i ­d

other than Minnesota exempt from federal income taxes under the Internal Revenue Code or any
other federal statute; and

except:
    (A) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends exempt from state taxation under the laws of
the United States; and
    (B) the portion of the exempt-interest dividends derived from interest income on obligations of
the state of Minnesota or its political or governmental subdivisions, municipalities, governmental
agencies or instrumentalities, but only if the portion of the exempt-interest dividends from such
Minnesota sources paid to all shareholders represents 95 percent or more of the exempt-interest
dividends, including any dividends exempt under subitem (A), that are paid by the regulated
investment company as defined in section 851(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the fund of the

    (2) the amount of income, sales and use, motor vehicle sales, or excise taxes paid or accrued

Canada, to the extent allowed as a deduction under section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, but
the addition may not be more than the amount by which the itemized deductions as allowed under
section 63(d) of the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the amount of the standard deduction as defined
in section 63(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, disregarding the amounts allowed under sections
63(c)(1)(C) and 63(c)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code. For the purpose of this paragraph, the

Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the taxable year
generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k) and the activity generates a loss for the
taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the taxable year, "the depreciation allowed
under section 168(k)" for the taxable year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the
activity under section 168(k) over the amount of the loss from the activity that is not allowed in
the taxable year. In succeeding taxable years when the losses not allowed in the taxable year are
allowed, the depreciation under section 168(k) is allowed;
   (8) 80 percent of the amount by which the deduction allowed by section 179 of the Internal
Revenue Code exceeds the deduction allowable by section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code of

   (2) On all over $25,680, but not over $102,030, 7.05 percent;
   (3) On all over $102,030, 7.85 percent.
    Married individuals filing separate returns, estates, and trusts must compute their income tax by
applying the above rates to their taxable income, except that the income brackets will be one-half
of the above amounts.
   (b) The income taxes imposed by this chapter upon unmarried individuals must be computed by

any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the

    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.067, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Amount of credit. (a) A taxpayer may take as a credit against the tax due from
the taxpayer and a spouse, if any, under this chapter an amount equal to the dependent care credit
for which the taxpayer is eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Internal Revenue
Code subject to the limitations provided in subdivision 2 except that in determining whether the
child qualified as a dependent, income received as a Minnesota family investment program grant or
allowance to or on behalf of the child must not be taken into account in determining whether the
child received more than half of the child's support from the taxpayer, and the provisions of section
32(b)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply.
    (b) If a child who has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year is cared
for at a licensed family day care home operated by the child's parent, the taxpayer is deemed to
have paid employment-related expenses. If the child is 16 months old or younger at the close of the
taxable year, the amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the maximum limit for one
qualified individual under section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the child is older
than 16 months of age but has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year, the
amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the amount the licensee would charge for the
care of a child of the same age for the same number of hours of care.
    (c) If a married couple:
    (1) has a child who has not attained the age of one year at the close of the taxable year;
    (2) files a joint tax return for the taxable year; and
    (3) does not participate in a dependent care assistance program as defined in section 129 of the
Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the actual employment related expenses paid for that child under
paragraph (a) or the deemed amount under paragraph (b), the lesser of (i) the combined earned
income of the couple or (ii) the amount of the maximum limit for one qualified individual under
section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code will be deemed to be the employment related
expense paid for that child. The earned income limitation of section 21(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code shall not apply to this deemed amount. These deemed amounts apply regardless of whether
any employment-related expenses have been paid.

    (d) If the taxpayer is not required and does not file a federal individual income tax return for the
tax year, no credit is allowed for any amount paid to any person unless:
    (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person are included on the return
claiming the credit; or
    (2) if the person is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the name and address of
the person are included on the return claiming the credit.
In the case of a failure to provide the information required under the preceding sentence, the
preceding sentence does not apply if it is shown that the taxpayer exercised due diligence in
attempting to provide the information required.
    In the case of a nonresident, part-year resident, or a person who has earned income not subject
to tax under this chapter including earned income excluded pursuant to section 290.01, subdivision

must be allocated based on the ratio by which the earned income of the claimant and the claimant's
spouse from Minnesota sources bears to the total earned income of the claimant and the claimant's
spouse.
   For residents of Minnesota, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision

Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 290.0671, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Credit allowed. (a) An individual is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by
this chapter equal to a percentage of earned income. To receive a credit, a taxpayer must be eligible
for a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (b) For individuals with no qualifying children, the credit equals 1.9125 percent of the first
$4,620 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 1.9125 percent of earned income or adjusted
gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of $5,770, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (c) For individuals with one qualifying child, the credit equals 8.5 percent of the first $6,920 of
earned income and 8.5 percent of earned income over $12,080 but less than $13,450. The credit is
reduced by 5.73 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess
of $15,080, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (d) For individuals with two or more qualifying children, the credit equals ten percent of the first
$9,720 of earned income and 20 percent of earned income over $14,860 but less than $16,800. The
credit is reduced by 10.3 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater,
in excess of $17,890, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
   (e) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage

or ­
   (1
    ­6­­) (15), the credit must be allocated based on the ratio of federal adjusted gross income reduced
by the earned income not subject to tax under this chapter over federal adjusted gross income. For
purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses ­  (1
            ­1
             ­­) (10) and ­(1

chapter."
   For the purposes of this paragraph, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
    (g) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2007, and before December 31, 2010, the $5,770
in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted
for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $3,000 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the commissioner shall annually adjust
the $3,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal
Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word "2007" shall be substituted for the word
"1992." For 2009, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months
ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2007, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of
the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be
rounded to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10.
The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    (h) The commissioner shall construct tables showing the amount of the credit at various income
levels and make them available to taxpayers. The tables shall follow the schedule contained in this
subdivision, except that the commissioner may graduate the transition between income brackets.

    (a) The compensation received for the performance of personal or professional services within
this state by an individual whose residence, place of abode, and place customarily returned to at
least once a month is in another state, shall be excluded from gross income to the extent such
compensation is subject to an income tax imposed by the state of residence; provided that such
state allows a similar exclusion of compensation received by residents of Minnesota for services
performed therein.
    (b) When it is deemed to be in the best interests of the people of this state, the commissioner
may determine that the provisions of paragraph (a) shall not apply. As long as the provisions of
paragraph (a) apply between Minnesota and Wisconsin, the provisions of paragraph (a) shall apply
to any individual who is domiciled in Wisconsin.
  (c) For the purposes of paragraph (a), whenever the Wisconsin tax on Minnesota residents which
would have been paid Wisconsin without paragraph (a) exceeds the Minnesota tax on Wisconsin

shall be effective for all years beginning after December 31, 1972. The data used for computing the
loss to either state shall be determined on or before September 30 of the year following the close of
the previous calendar year.
   (d) Interest is payable on all amounts calculated under paragraph (c) relating to taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2000. Interest accrues from July 1 of the taxable year. The
commissioner of revenue is authorized to enter into agreements with the state of Wisconsin
specifying the compensation required under paragraph (b), the reciprocity payment due date,
conditions constituting delinquency, interest rates, and a method for computing interest due.
Calculation of compensation under the agreement must specify if the revenue loss is determined
before or after the allowance of each state's credit for taxes paid to the other state.
    (e) If an agreement cannot be reached as to the amount of the loss, the commissioner of revenue
and the taxing official of the state of Wisconsin shall each appoint a member of a board of arbitration
and these members shall appoint the third member of the board. The board shall select one of its
members as chair. Such board may administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena witnesses, and require
their attendance, require the production of books, papers and documents, and hold hearings at such
places as are deemed necessary. The board shall then make a determination as to the amount to be
paid the other state which determination shall be final and conclusive.
    (f) The commissioner may furnish copies of returns, reports, or other information to the taxing
official of the state of Wisconsin, a member of the board of arbitration, or a consultant under joint
contract with the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin for the purpose of making a determination as
to the amount to be paid the other state under the provisions of this section. Prior to the release of
any information under the provisions of this section, the person to whom the information is to be
released shall sign an agreement which provides that the person will protect the confidentiality of
the returns and information revealed thereby to the extent that it is protected under the laws of the
state of Minnesota.

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.17, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Income not derived from conduct of a trade or business. The income of a taxpayer
subject to the allocation rules that is not derived from the conduct of a trade or business must be
assigned in accordance with paragraphs (a) to (f):
    (a)(1) Subject to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3), income from wages as defined in section 3401(a)
and (f) of the Internal Revenue Code is assigned to this state if, and to the extent that, the work of
the employee is performed within it; all other income from such sources is treated as income from
sources without this state.
   Severance pay shall be considered income from labor or personal or professional services.
    (2) In the case of an individual who is a nonresident of Minnesota and who is an athlete or
entertainer, income from compensation for labor or personal services performed within this state
shall be determined in the following manner:
    (i) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident
salaried athletic team employee shall be determined by using a fraction in which the denominator
contains the total number of days in which the individual is under a duty to perform for the
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                         11985

employer, and the numerator is the total number of those days spent in Minnesota. For purposes
of this paragraph, off-season training activities, unless conducted at the team's facilities as part of
a team imposed program, are not included in the total number of duty days. Bonuses earned as a
result of play during the regular season or for participation in championship, play-off, or all-star
games must be allocated under the formula. Signing bonuses are not subject to allocation under the
formula if they are not conditional on playing any games for the team, are payable separately from
any other compensation, and are nonrefundable; and
    (ii) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident,
and who is an athlete or entertainer not listed in clause (i), for that person's athletic or entertainment
performance in Minnesota shall be determined by assigning to this state all income from
performances or athletic contests in this state.
    (3) For purposes of this section, amounts received by a nonresident as "retirement income" as
defined in section (b)(1) of the State Income Taxation of Pension Income Act, Public Law 104-95,
are not considered income derived from carrying on a trade or business or from wages or other
compensation for work an employee performed in Minnesota, and are not taxable under this chapter.
   (b) Income or gains from tangible property located in this state that is not employed in the
business of the recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state.
    (c) Income or gains from intangible personal property not employed in the business of the
recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state if the recipient of the income or gains
is a resident of this state or is a resident trust or estate.
    Gain on the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original
cost of partnership tangible property in this state to the original cost of partnership tangible
property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. If more than 50 percent of the value of
the partnership's assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest
is allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full
tax period immediately preceding the tax period of the partnership during which the partnership
interest was sold.
    Gain on the sale of an interest in a single member limited liability company that is disregarded
for federal income tax purposes is allocable to this state as if the single member limited liability
company did not exist and the assets of the limited liability company are personally owned by the
sole member.
   Gain on the sale of goodwill or income from a covenant not to compete that is connected with
a business operating all or partially in Minnesota is allocated to this state to the extent that the
income from the business in the year preceding the year of sale was assignable to Minnesota under
subdivision 3.
    When an employer pays an employee for a covenant not to compete, the income allocated to this
state is in the ratio of the employee's service in Minnesota in the calendar year preceding leaving the
employment of the employer over the total services performed by the employee for the employer in
that year.
    (d) Income from winnings on a bet made by an individual while in Minnesota is assigned to this
state. In this paragraph, "bet" has the meaning given in section 609.75, subdivision 2, as limited by
11986                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [106TH DAY

section 609.75, subdivision 3, clauses (1), (2), and (3).
   (e) All items of gross income not covered in paragraphs (a) to (d) and not part of the taxpayer's
income from a trade or business shall be assigned to the taxpayer's domicile.
   (f) For the purposes of this section, working as an employee shall not be considered to be
conducting a trade or business.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

information. If the commissioner neither certifies the investor nor rejects the application within 30
days of receiving the original application or within 30 days of receiving the additional information
requested, whichever is later, then the application is deemed rejected, and the commissioner must
refund the $350 application fee. An investor who applies for certification and is rejected may
reapply.
   (c) To receive certification, an investor must (1) be a natural person; and (2) certify to the
commissioner that the investor will only invest in a transaction that is exempt under section
80A.46, clause (13) or (14), or in a security registered under section 80A.50, paragraph (b).
    (d) In order for a qualified investment in a qualified small business to be eligible for tax credits,
a qualified investor who makes the investment must have applied for and received certification for
the calendar year prior to making the qualified investment, except in the case of an investor who
is not an accredited investor, within the meaning of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Code of Federal Regulations, title 17, section 230.501, paragraph (a), application for
certification may be made within 30 days after making the qualified investment.

interest earned on the tax is credited to amounts due to the vendor by the purchaser or returned to
the purchaser by the vendor.
   (b) In addition to the requirements of subdivision 1, a claim for refund under this subdivision
must state in writing that the tax and interest earned on the tax has been or will be refunded or
credited to the purchaser by the vendor.
    (c) Within 60 days after the date the commissioner issues the refund, any amount not refunded
or credited to the purchaser by the vendor, as required by paragraph (a), must be returned to the
commissioner by the vendor.
    (d) After the commissioner refunds the tax and interest to the vendor, if the commissioner
determines that the vendor did not refund or credit the tax and interest as provided in this
subdivision, or did not return the amount required to be returned under paragraph (c), the
commissioner may assess the vendor for underpayment of tax and interest equal to that portion of
the amount that was not refunded or credited to the purchaser. The assessment bears interest which
is computed at the rate specified in section 270C.40, subdivision 5, on the unpaid amount from the
date the commissioner issues the refund until the date the amount is paid to the commissioner. The
assessment may be made at any time within 3-1/2 years after the commissioner refunds the tax and
interest to the vendor. If part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material
fact, the assessment may be made at any time.

not purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or consumption in Minnesota.

or proof required by paragraph (b), clause (2), within 120 days after the date of the commissioner's

liability resulting from failing to pay the tax at the new rate during the first 30 days of the rate change,
beginning on the day after the date of enactment of the rate change, whether or not the purchaser
has been given direct pay authorization by the commissioner. Relief from liability provided by this
paragraph shall not apply if the failure to pay at the newly effective rate extends beyond 30 days
after the enactment of the new rate, and shall not apply to a purchaser that did not continue to pay
the tax at the immediately preceding tax rate during the 30-day period. The relief provided by this
paragraph shall not apply if the commissioner determines that the purchaser fraudulently failed to

   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the

factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1;
   (2) the commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:

commissioner of revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, whether it is
in compliance with any agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under
section 469.315. A business that fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those
still operating in the zone, that submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later
determines materially misrepresents the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to
the repayment provisions under section 469.319 from January 1 of the year in which the report is
due or the date that the business became subject to section 469.319, whichever is earlier. Any such
business is permanently barred from obtaining benefits under section 469.315. For purposes of
this section, the bar applies to an entity and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an
ownership interest of at least 20 percent of the entity.

enter into an agreement with an issuer which is not an entitlement issuer whereby the recipient issuer
issues qualified mortgage bonds, up to $100,000 of which are issued pursuant to bonding authority
allocated to the original entitlement issuer under this section. The agreement may be approved and
executed by the mayor of the entitlement issuer with or without approval or review by the city

the next business day after the holiday.
   (b) Prior to October 1, only the following applications shall be awarded allocations from the
unified pool. Allocations shall be awarded in the following order of priority:
   (1) applications for residential rental project bonds;
   (2) applications for small issue bonds for manufacturing projects; and

   (9) applications for redevelopment bonds.
    (d) If there are two or more applications for manufacturing projects from the unified pool and
there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all manufacturing projects in any
one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded based on the number of
points awarded a project under section 474A.045 with those projects receiving the greatest number
of points receiving allocation first. If two or more applications for manufacturing projects receive
an equal amount of points, available bonding authority shall be awarded by lot unless otherwise
agreed to by the respective issuers.
    (e) If there are two or more applications for enterprise zone facility projects from the unified
pool and there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all enterprise zone facility
projects in any one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded based on
the number of points awarded a project under section 474A.045 with those projects receiving the
greatest number of points receiving allocation first. If two or more applications for enterprise zone
facility projects receive an equal amount of points, available bonding authority shall be awarded by
lot unless otherwise agreed to by the respective issuers.
    (f) If there are two or more applications for residential rental projects from the unified pool and
there is insufficient bonding authority to provide allocations for all residential rental projects in any
one allocation period, the available bonding authority shall be awarded in the following order of
priority: (1) projects that preserve existing federally subsidized housing; (2) projects that are not
restricted to persons who are 55 years of age or older; and (3) other residential rental projects.
    (g) From the first Monday in August through the last Monday in November, $20,000,000 of
bonding authority or an amount equal to the total annual amount of bonding authority allocated to
the small issue pool under section 474A.03, subdivision 1, less the amount allocated to issuers from

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 134.34, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Limitation. (a) For calendar year 2010 and later, a regional library basic system
support grant shall not be made to a regional public library system for a participating city or county
which decreases the dollar amount provided for support for operating purposes of public library
service below the amount provided by it for the second, or third preceding year, whichever is less.
For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 1, any funds provided under section 473.757,
subdivision 2, for extending library hours of operation shall not be considered amounts provided
by a city or county for support for operating purposes of public library service. This subdivision
shall not apply to participating cities or counties where the adjusted net tax capacity of that city
or county has decreased, if the dollar amount of the reduction in support is not greater than the
dollar amount by which support would be decreased if the reduction in support were made in direct
proportion to the decrease in adjusted net tax capacity.
    (b) For calendar year 2009 and later, in any calendar year in which a city's or county's aid under
sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 or ­    c­ ­­t

after the city or county has certified its levy payable in that year, it may reduce its local support by
the lesser of:
     (1) ten percent; or
    (2) a percent equal to the ratio of the aid and credit reimbursement reductions to the city's
or county's revenue base, based on aids certified for the current calendar year. For calendar year
2009 only, the reduction under this paragraph shall be based on 2008 aid and credit reimbursement
reductions under the December 2008 unallotment, as well as any aid and credit reimbursement
reductions in calendar year 2009. For pay 2009 only, the commissioner of revenue will calculate the
reductions under this paragraph and certify them to the commissioner of education within 15 days
of May 17, 2009.
    (c) For taxes payable in 2010 and later, in any payable year in which the total amounts certified
for city or county aids under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 are less than the total amounts paid
under those sections in the previous calendar year, a city or county may reduce its local support by
the lesser of:
     (1) ten percent; or
     (2) a percent equal to the ratio of:
   (i) the difference between (A) the sum of the aid it was paid under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014

be held before 6:00 p.m. It must provide a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers
may call if they have questions related to the notice and an address where comments will be received
by mail.
    (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
    (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
    (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under

section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in

commissioner of revenue under section 275.74, subdivision 2;
    (8) pay amounts required to correct an error in the levy certified to the county auditor by a city

the previous levy year for the purposes specified in this clause and included in the city's or county's
previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be deducted from the levy limit base
under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or county's current year levy limit;
    (18) for counties, to pay for the increase in their share of health and human service costs caused
by reductions in federal health and human services grants effective after September 30, 2007;

equal to the new facility's first full year's operating costs as described in this clause; and
   (25) for the estimated amount of reduction to market value credit reimbursements under section
273.1384 for credits payable in the year in which the levy is payable.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.71, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Property tax levy limit. (a) For taxes levied in 2008 through 2010, the property tax
levy limit for a local governmental unit is equal to its adjusted levy limit base determined under
subdivision 4 plus any additional levy authorized under section 275.73, which is levied against net
tax capacity, reduced by the sum of (i) the total amount of aids and reimbursements that the local
governmental unit is certified to receive under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014, (ii) taconite aids
under sections 298.28 and 298.282 including any aid which was required to be placed in a special
fund for expenditure in the next succeeding year, (iii) estimated payments to the local governmental
unit under section 272.029, adjusted for any error in estimation in the preceding year, and (iv) aids
under section 477A.16.
    (b) If an aid, payment, or other amount used in paragraph (a) to reduce a local government unit's
levy limit is reduced by an unallotment under section 16A.152, the amount of the aid, payment, or
other amount prior to the unallotment is used in the computations in paragraph (a). In order for a
local government unit to levy outside of its limit to offset the reduction in revenues attributable to
an unallotment, it must do so under, and to the extent authorized by, a special levy authorization.

    475.755 EMERGENCY DEBT CERTIFICATES.
106TH DAY]                                      SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                                          12031

    (a) If at any time during a fiscal year the receipts of a local government are reasonably expected
to be reduced below the amount provided in the local government's budget when the final property
tax levy to be collected during the fiscal year was certified and the receipts are insufficient to meet
the expenses incurred or to be incurred during the fiscal year, the governing body of the local
government may authorize and sell certificates of indebtedness to mature within two years or less
from the end of the fiscal year in which the certificates are issued. The maximum principal amount
of the certificates that it may issue in a fiscal year is limited to the expected reduction in receipts plus
the cost of issuance. The certificates may be issued in the manner and on the terms the governing
body determines by resolution.
   (b) The governing body of the local government shall levy taxes for the payment of principal
and interest on the certificates in accordance with section 475.61.
     (c) The certificates are not to be included in the net debt of the issuing local government.
    (d) To the extent that a local government issues certificates under this section to fund an
unallotment or other reduction in its state aid, the local government m          ­­ay

                                                            , The formula aid for a city is equal to the sum
of (1) its city jobs base, (2) its small city aid base, and (3) the need increase percentage multiplied
by the average of its unmet need for the most recently available two years.

No city may have a formula aid amount less than zero. The need increase percentage must be the
same for all cities.
    The applicable need increase percentage must be calculated by the Department of Revenue so
that the total of the aid under subdivision 9 equals the total amount available for aid under section

of the state under laws allowing the county board to classify and manage tax-forfeited lands held
by the state in trust for the local units as provided in section 281.25, the county board has the
discretion to decide that some lands in public ownership should be retained and managed for
public benefits while other lands should be returned to private ownership. Parcels of land becoming
the property of the state in trust under law declaring the forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes
must be classified by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie as conservation or
nonconservation. In making the classification the board shall consider the present use of adjacent
lands, the productivity of the soil, the character of forest or other growth, accessibility of lands to
established roads, schools, and other public services, their peculiar suitability or desirability for
particular uses, and the suitability of the forest resources on the land for multiple use,             ­ and sustained
yield management. The classification, furthermore, must: (1) encourage and foster a mode of land
utilization that will facilitate the economical and adequate provision of transportation, roads, water
supply, drainage, sanitation, education, and recreation; (2) facilitate reduction of governmental
expenditures; (3) conserve and develop the natural resources; and (4) foster and develop agriculture
and other industries in the districts and places best suited to them.

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
    (c) Prior to meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting; provided
that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site. The
notice must also be mailed or otherwise delivered to each person who has filed a request for notice
of special meetings with the public body, regardless of whether the matter is considered at a regular
or special meeting. The notice must be mailed or delivered at least 60 days before the date of the
meeting. If the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be mailed or
delivered at least 14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The public body shall publish
the notice once, at least 30 days before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within
the area of the public body's authority. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to
each person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided
in chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this
paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities at the meeting.
        (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent

information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. The county board must solicit and consider any relevant components of
current municipal or metropolitan comprehensive land use plans that incorporate the area in which
the land is located. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay taking
action on any parcel or parcels. In order for a state agency or a governmental subdivision of the
state to preserve its right to request a purchase or other acquisition of a forfeited parcel, it may, at
any time following forfeiture, file a written request to withhold the parcel from sale or lease to others
under the provisions of subdivision 1a.
    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
    (f) A county board may by resolution elect to use the classification and reclassification
procedures provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), instead of the procedures provided in paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d). Once an election is made under this paragraph, it is effective for a minimum of
five years.
    (g) The classification or reclassification of tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released
from the trust may be made by the county board using information made available to it by any
office or department of the federal, state, or local governments, or by any other person or agency
possessing pertinent information at the time the classification is made.
    (h) If the lands are located within the boundaries of an organized town or incorporated
municipality, a classification or reclassification and sale must first be approved by the town board
of the town or the governing body of the municipality in which the lands are located. The town
board of the town or the governing body of the municipality is considered to have approved the
classification or reclassification and sale if the county board is not notified of the disapproval of
the classification or reclassification and sale within 60 days of the date the request for approval
was transmitted to the town board of the town or governing body of the municipality. If the town
board or governing body disapproves of the classification or reclassification and sale, the county
board must follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) and (d), with regard to the parcel, and must
additionally cause to be published in a newspaper a notice of the date, time, location, and purpose
of the required meeting.
    (i) If a town board or a governing body of a municipality or a park and recreation board in a
city of the first class desires to acquire any parcel lying in the town or municipality by procedures
authorized in this section, it may file a written request under subdivision 1a, paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:

                                      ­ to public entities. (a) Upon written request from a state
agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be
106TH DAY]                                 SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                                  12035

withheld from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted
to the county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease
to any other party for six months, and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding
period to the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision
of the state, the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county
during the period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to
the requesting party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting
party terminates the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for
that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of the
state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property o­­
                                                                                           r. When
the term "market value" is used in this section, it means an estimate of the full and actual market
value of the parcel as determined by the county board, but in making this determination, the board
and the persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist
in the determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application o
                         ­­
                          f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market, or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing, and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.
     (e) Nonconservation tax-forfeited land held in trust in favor of the taxing districts may be
conveyed by the commissioner of revenue m                ­­ay­­­­

recommendation of the county board. For the purposes of this paragraph, "authorized public use"
means a use that allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property
in numbers appropriate to its size and use, or is for a public service facility. Authorized public uses
as defined in this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road, or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, athletic fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;
    (4) transit facilities for buses, light rail transit, commuter rail or passenger rail, including transit
ways, park-and-ride lots, transit stations, maintenance and garage facilities, and other facilities
related to a public transit system;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water towers, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
No monetary compensation or consideration is required for the conveyance, except as provided in
subdivision 1g, but the conveyance is subject to the conditions provided in law, including, but not
limited to, the reversion provisions of subdivisions 1c and 1d.
    (f) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision of the state by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the
favorable recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the
board that prior to forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement or instrument, but the conveyance failed to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or
consideration is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that prior to forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed
to occur prior to forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions
attach to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state
for less than its market value for either: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or
storage of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration
and preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant
limiting the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed
back to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the

commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph shall be
refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.
   (i) A park and recreation board in a city of the first class is a governmental subdivision for the
purposes of this section.

    Subd. 1c. Deed of conveyance; form; approvals. The deed of conveyance for property
conveyed for ­a an authorized public use under the authorities in subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), must

property to the approved authorized public use for which it was conveyed, or an abandonment of
that use, except as provided in subdivision 1d.

the purposes of this paragraph, there is no failure to put the land to the authorized public use and
no abandonment of that use if a formal plan of the governmental subdivision, including, but not
limited to, a comprehensive plan or land use plan that shows an intended future use of the land for
the authorized public use.
     (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue on or after January
1, 2007, may be acquired by that governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the
conveyance if the commissioner determines upon written application from the subdivision that the
subdivision has in fact put the property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed, and
the subdivision has made a finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Prior
to conveying the property, the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land
is located objects to a conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without
further act by or obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the
commissioner makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on
behalf of the state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For
purposes of this paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in
a formal plan of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.
    (c) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue before January
1, 2007, is released from the use restriction and possibility of reversion on January 1, 2022, if
the county board records a resolution describing the land and citing this paragraph. The county
board may authorize the county treasurer to deduct the amount of the recording fees from future
settlements of property taxes to the subdivision.
    (d) All property conveyed under a conditional use deed executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph
(e), by the commissioner of revenue is released from the use restriction and reverter, and any use

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonconservation lands; appraisal and sale. (a) All parcels of land classified as
nonconservation, except those which may be reserved, shall be sold as provided, if it is determined,
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie, that it is advisable to do so, having in
mind their accessibility, their proximity to existing public improvements, and the effect of their
sale and occupancy on the public burdens. Any parcels of land proposed to be sold shall be first

appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
    (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall
submit to the commissioner at least 60 days before the first publication of the list of lands to be
offered for sale a list of all lands included on the list which are situated outside of any incorporated
municipality. If, at any time before the opening of the sale, the commissioner notifies the county
auditor in writing that there is standing timber on any parcel of ­    su
                                                                        ­­

sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
       (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until
the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                                  In

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only
(1) a payment of at least ten percent of the purchase price must be made at the time of purchase, and
the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber
or timber products must not be removed from these lands until an amount equal to the appraised
value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid
by the purchaser. If a parcel of land bearing standing timber or timber products is sold at public
auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the
excess bid allocated to timber or timber products has been paid in addition to the appraised value of
the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is
applicable. Interest on the unpaid contract balance on sales occurring before July 1, 1982, is payable
at the rate applicable to the sale at the time that the sale occurred.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. County sales; notice, purchase price, disposition. The sale must commence at the time
determined by the county board of the county in which the parcels are located. The county auditor
shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are
sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as

provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7a. City sales; alternate procedures. Land located in a home rule charter or statutory
city, or in a town which cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local ordinances
regarding minimum area, shape, frontage or access may be sold by the county auditor pursuant to
this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics
of the land indicate that its highest and best use will be achieved by combining it with an adjoining
parcel and the city or town has not adopted a local ordinance governing minimum area, shape,
frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists
of an undivided interest in land or land and improvements, the property may also be sold to the
other owners under this subdivision. The sale of land pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject
to any conditions imposed by the county board pursuant to section 282.03. The governing body of
the city or town may recommend to the county board conditions to be imposed on the sale. The
county auditor may restrict the sale to owners of lands adjoining the land to be sold. The county
auditor shall conduct the sale by sealed bid or may select another means of sale. The land shall be
sold to the highest bidder ­ bu

value. All owners of land adjoining the land to be sold shall be given a written notice at least 30
days prior to the sale.
   This subdivision shall be liberally construed to encourage the sale and utilization of tax-forfeited
land, to eliminate nuisances and dangerous conditions and to increase compliance with land use
ordinances.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Notice; public hearing for use change. If a governmental subdivision that acquired
a parcel for public use under this section later determines to change the use, it must hold a public
hearing on the proposed use change. The governmental subdivision must mail written notice of the
proposed use change and the public hearing to each owner of property that is within 400 feet of
the parcel at least ten days and no more than 60 days before it holds the hearing. The notice must
identify: (1) the parcel, (2) its current use, (3) the proposed use, (4) the date, time, and place of the
public hearing, and (5) where to submit written comments on the proposal and that the public is
invited to testify at the public hearing.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to a change in use of
a parcel acquired under Minnesota Statutes, section 282.01, whether acquired by the governmental
subdivision before or after the effective date of this section.

      Section 1. [3.192] REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR RENEWED TAX EXPENDITURES.
    Any bill that creates, renews, or continues a tax expenditure must include a statement of intent
that clearly provides the purpose of the tax expenditure and a standard or goal against which its

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.34, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority. (a) The commissioner may abate, reduce, or refund any penalty or
interest that is imposed by a law administered by the commissioner, or imposed by section 270.0725,
subdivision 1 or 2, as a result of the late payment of tax or late filing of a return, if the failure to
timely pay the tax or failure to timely file the return is due to reasonable cause, or if the taxpayer is
located in a presidentially declared disaster or in a presidentially declared state of emergency area
or in an area declared to be in a state of emergency by the governor under section 12.31.
   (b) The commissioner shall abate any part of a penalty or additional tax charge under section
289A.25, subdivision 2, or 289A.26, subdivision 4, attributable to erroneous advice given to the
taxpayer in writing by an employee of the department acting in an official capacity, if the advice:
      (1) was reasonably relied on and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer;
and
      (2) was not the result of failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information.

      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 270C.52, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Payment agreements. (a) When any portion of any tax payable to the commissioner
together with interest and penalty thereon, if any, has not been paid, the commissioner may extend
the time for payment for a further period. When the authority of this section is invoked, the extension
shall be evidenced by written agreement signed by the taxpayer and the commissioner, stating the
amount of the tax with penalty and interest, if any, and providing for the payment of the amount in
installments.
      (b) The agreement may contain a confession of judgment for the amount and for any unpaid
106TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 15, 2010                                         12045

portion thereof. If the agreement contains a confession of judgment, the confession of judgment
must provide that the commissioner may enter judgment against the taxpayer in the district court of
the county of residence as shown upon the taxpayer's tax return for the unpaid portion of the amount
specified in the extension agreement.
    (c) The agreement shall provide that it can be terminated, after notice by the commissioner, if
information provided by the taxpayer prior to the agreement was inaccurate or incomplete, collection
of the tax covered by the agreement is in jeopardy, there is a subsequent change in the taxpayer's
financial condition, the taxpayer has failed to make a payment due under the agreement, or the
taxpayer has failed to pay any other tax or file a tax return coming due after the agreement.
    (d) The notice must be given at least 14 calendar days prior to termination, and shall advise the
taxpayer of the right to request a reconsideration from the commissioner of whether termination
is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. A request for reconsideration does not stay
collection action beyond the 14-day notice period. If the commissioner has reason to believe that
collection of the tax covered by the agreement is in jeopardy, the commissioner may proceed under
section 270C.36 and terminate the agreement without regard to the 14-day period.
    (e) The commissioner may accept other collateral the commissioner considers appropriate to
secure satisfaction of the tax liability. The principal sum specified in the agreement shall bear interest
at the rate specified in section 270C.40 on all unpaid portions thereof until the same has been fully
paid or the unpaid portion thereof has been entered as a judgment. The judgment shall bear interest
at the rate specified in section 270C.40.
    (f) If it appears to the commissioner that the tax reported by the taxpayer is in excess of the
amount actually owing by the taxpayer, the extension agreement or the judgment entered pursuant
thereto shall be corrected. If after making the extension agreement or entering judgment with respect
thereto, the commissioner determines that the tax as reported by the taxpayer is less than the amount
actually due, the commissioner shall assess a further tax in accordance with the provisions of law
applicable to the tax.
   (g) The authority granted to the commissioner by this section is in addition to any other authority
granted to the commissioner by law to extend the time of payment or the time for filing a return and
shall not be construed in limitation thereof.
    (h) The commissioner shall charge a fee for entering into payment agreements that reflects the
commissioner's costs for entering into payment agreements. The fee is set at $50 and is charged for
entering into a payment agreement, for entering into a new payment agreement after the taxpayer
has defaulted on a prior agreement, and for entering into a new payment agreement as a result of
renegotiation of the terms of an existing agreement. The fee is paid to the commissioner before the
payment agreement becomes effective and does not reduce the amount of the liability.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for payment agreements entered into or
renegotiated after June 30, 2010.

from paying electronically shall be allowed to remit the payment by mail. The filer must notify
the commissioner of revenue of the intent to pay by mail before doing so on a form prescribed by
the commissioner. No extra fee may be charged to a person making payment by mail under this
paragraph. The payment must be postmarked at least two business days before the due date for
making the payment in order to be considered paid on a timely basis.
    (e) Whenever the liability is $120,000 or more separately for: (1) the tax imposed under chapter
297A; (2) a fee that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes;
or (3) any other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A
taxes, then the payment of all the liabilities on the return must be accelerated as provided in this
subdivision.
    (f) At the start of the first calendar quarter at least 90 days after the cash flow account
established in section 16A.152, subdivision 1, and the budget reserve account established in section
16A.152, subdivision 1a, reach the amounts listed in section 16A.152, subdivision 2, paragraph
(a), the remittance of the accelerated payments required under paragraph (a), clause (2), must be
suspended. The commissioner of management and budget shall notify the commissioner of revenue
when the accounts have reached the required amounts. Beginning with the suspension of paragraph
(a), clause (2), for a vendor with a liability of $120,000 or more during a fiscal year ending June
30, 2009, and fiscal years thereafter, the taxes imposed by chapter 297A are due and payable to
the commissioner on the 20th day of the month following the month in which the taxable event
occurred. Payments of tax liabilities for taxable events occurring in June under paragraph (b) are
not changed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes due and payable after September 1,
2010.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.60, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 31. Accelerated payment of monthly sales tax liability; penalty for underpayment.
For payments made after September 1, 2010, if a vendor is required by section 289A.20, subdivision
4, paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i) or (ii), to make accelerated payments, then the penalty for
underpayment is as follows:
    (a) For those vendors that must remit a 90 percent payment by the 14th day of the month
following the month in which the taxable event occurred, as an estimation of monthly sales tax
liabilities, including the liability of any fee or other tax that is to be reported on the same return
as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes, for the month in which the taxable event occurred, the
vendor shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of the amount of liability that was required to be
paid by the 14th day of the month, less the amount remitted by the 14th day of the month. The
penalty must not be imposed, however, if the amount remitted by the 14th day of the month equals
the least of: (1) 90 percent of the liability for the month preceding the month in which the taxable
event occurred; (2) 90 percent of the liability for the same month in the previous calendar year as
the month in which the taxable event occurred; or (3) 90 percent of the average monthly liability
for the previous calendar year.
    (b) For those vendors that, on or before the 20th day of the month in which the taxable event
occurs, must remit to the commissioner a prepayment of sales tax liabilities for the month in which
the taxable event occurs equal to 67 percent of the liabilities for the previous month, including the
liability of any fee or other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter

297A taxes, for the month in which the taxable event occurred, the vendor shall pay a penalty equal
to ten percent of the amount of liability that was required to be paid by the 20th of the month, less
the amount remitted by the 20th of the month. The penalty must not be imposed, however, if the
amount remitted by the 20th of the month equals the lesser of 67 percent of the liability for the
month preceding the month in which the taxable event occurred or 67 percent of the liability of the
same month in the previous calendar year as the month in which the taxable event occurred.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes due and payable after September 1,
2010.
     Sec. 6. PAYMENT OF REFUNDS.
    (a) In paying refunds during fiscal year 2011 of overpayments of corporate franchise tax and
of sales tax, including but not limited to capital equipment refunds, the commissioner of revenue
shall delay paying a sufficient number of these refunds until fiscal year 2012 so that $152,000,000
less in refunds is paid in fiscal year 2011 than otherwise would have been paid. This amount is in
addition to any amount that the commissioner delays pursuant to administrative actions undertaken
in connection with the unallotment announced in June 2009. Refunds delayed by the commissioner
under this section are deemed to be due on July 1, 2011, for budget purposes, if the law otherwise
would provide an earlier date. Any refunds paid after June 30, 2011, and before the close of fiscal
year 2011 are deemed to be paid in fiscal year 2012 for budget purposes.
    (b) In carrying out the requirement of paragraph (a), the commissioner shall, to the extent
possible, minimize delaying the payment of refunds that would result in payment of additional
interest by the state. The commissioner may select refunds for delayed payment under this section
or exempt refunds from this section in the manner that the commissioner determines, in the
commissioner's sole discretion, has the least adverse effect on tax administration and taxpayer
compliance.

Payment 4                August 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all aid
                         entitlements except state paid property tax credits
Payment 6                September 30: 40 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                         aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits
Payment 8                October 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                         aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
fiscal years 2010 and later.
     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.45, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7b. Advance final payment. (a) Notwithstanding subdivisions 3 and 7, if the current year
aid payment percentage, under subdivision 2, is less than 90, then a school district or charter school
exceeding its expenditure limitations under section 123B.83 as of June 30 of the prior fiscal year
may receive a portion of its final payment for the current fiscal year on June 20, if requested by the
district or charter school. The amount paid under this subdivision must not exceed the lesser of:
    (1) the difference between 90 percent and the current year payment percentage in subdivision
2, paragraph (d), in the current fiscal year times the sum of the district or charter school's general
education aid plus the aid adjustment in section 127A.50 for the current fiscal year; or
    (2) the amount by which the district's or charter school's net negative unreserved general fund
balance as of June 30 of the prior fiscal year exceeds 2.5 percent of the district or charter school's
expenditures for that fiscal year.
    (b) The state total advance final payment under this subdivision for any year must not exceed
$7,500,000. If the amount request exceeds $7,500,000, the advance final payment for each eligible
district must be reduced proportionately.

either as a volunteer or on a fee basis. If a guardian ad litem is appointed on a fee basis, the court shall
enter an order for costs, fees, and disbursements in favor of the child's guardian ad litem. The order
may be made against either or both parties, except that any part of the costs, fees, or disbursements
which the court finds the parties are incapable of paying shall be borne by the state courts. The
costs of court-appointed counsel to the guardian ad litem shall be paid by the county in which the
proceeding is being held if a party is incapable of paying for them. Until the recommendations of
the task force created in Laws 1999, chapter 216, article 7, section 42, are implemented, the costs
of court-appointed counsel to a guardian ad litem in the Eighth Judicial District shall be paid by the
state courts if a party is incapable of paying for them. In no event may the court order that costs,
fees, or disbursements be paid by a party receiving public assistance or legal assistance or by a party
whose annual income falls below the poverty line as established under United States Code, title 42,
section 9902(2).
   (b) In each fiscal year, the commissioner of management and budget shall deposit guardian ad

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic

classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.
    (d) In addition to the reduction in paragraphs (b) and (c), the total payment for fee-for-service
admissions occurring on or after August 1, 2005, made to hospitals for inpatient services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 6.0 percent from the current statutory rates. Mental
health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision 16
are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for purposes
of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January 1, 2006, to
reflect this reduction.

statutory rates. Facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments
made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after October 1, 2009, to
reflect this reduction.
    (i) In order to offset the ratable reductions provided for in this subdivision, the total payment
rate for medical assistance fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2010, to June 30,
2011, made to Minnesota hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown,
shall be increased by five percent from the current statutory rates. Effective July 1, 2011, the rate
increase under this paragraph shall be reduced to 1.96 percent. For purposes of this paragraph,
medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care. The commissioner shall not
adjust rates paid to a prepaid health plan under contract with the commissioner to reflect payments
provided in this paragraph. The commissioner may utilize a settlement process to adjust rates in
excess of the Medicare upper limits on payments.

at a percentage calculated to cost not more than $10,000,000 each fiscal year, including state
and federal shares. For purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general

services provided to MinnesotaCare enrollees eligible under section 256L.04, subdivision 7, or who
qualify under section 256L.04, subdivisions 1 and 2, with family gross income that exceeds 175
percent of the federal poverty guidelines and who are not pregnant, who are 18 years old or older
on the date of admission to the inpatient hospital must be in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b).
Payment for adults who are not pregnant and are eligible under section 256L.04, subdivisions 1 and
2, and whose incomes are equal to or less than 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, shall
be as provided for under paragraph (c).
    (a) If the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment required under section 256L.03,
subdivision 4, is less than or equal to the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit under
section 256L.03, subdivision 3, payment must be the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment
required under section 256L.03, subdivision 4. The hospital must not seek payment from the
enrollee in addition to the co-payment. The MinnesotaCare payment plus the co-payment must be
treated as payment in full.
   (b) If the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment required under section 256L.03,
subdivision 4, is greater than the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit under section
256L.03, subdivision 3, payment must be the lesser of:
     (1) the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit; or
    (2) charges submitted for the inpatient hospital services less any co-payment established under
section 256L.03, subdivision 4.
    The hospital may seek payment from the enrollee for the amount by which usual and customary
charges exceed the payment under this paragraph. If payment is reduced under section 256L.03,
subdivision 3, paragraph (b), the hospital may not seek payment from the enrollee for the amount
of the reduction.

        ) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments and county-based purchasing plan payments under this
section pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable,
objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based
on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be
outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and
no later than July 31 of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. A   ­­­

    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall withhold an
additional three percent of managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan payments under
this section. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31
of the following calendar year. The return of the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the plan's emergency room
utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from the
plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of
the following calendar year if the managed care plan demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced
by 25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less
than the targeted amount. The withhold described in this paragraph does not apply to county-based
purchasing plans.
    (e) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include
as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this section that is reasonably

   (b) The commissioner, after reviewing the recommendations of the advisory committee, shall
adopt a uniform format for the guide to be used by individual providers, and the required components
of materials to be used by providers to inform assisted living clients of their legal rights, and shall
make the uniform format and the required components available to assisted living providers.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 252.27, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Contribution amount. (a) The natural or adoptive parents of a minor child, including
a child determined eligible for medical assistance without consideration of parental income, must
contribute to the cost of services used by making monthly payments on a sliding scale based on
income, unless the child is married or has been married, parental rights have been terminated, or
the child's adoption is subsidized according to section 259.67 or through title IV-E of the Social
Security Act. The parental contribution is a partial or full payment for medical services provided
for diagnostic, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitation, maintenance, and personal
care services as defined in United States Code, title 26, section 213, needed by the child with a
chronic illness or disability.
    (b) For households with adjusted gross income equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal
poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following schedule
of rates to the adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
    (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 975 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to ten percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 975

percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
   (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 975 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 12.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
    If the child lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior
to calculating the parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section
256B.35, the parent is responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section
in addition to the parental contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is
reduced by any amount required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only
if actually paid.
    (c) The household size to be used in determining the amount of contribution under paragraph (b)
includes natural and adoptive parents and their dependents, including the child receiving services.
Adjustments in the contribution amount due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines
shall be implemented on the first day of July following publication of the changes.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b), "income" means the adjusted gross income of the natural
or adoptive parents determined according to the previous year's federal tax form, except, effective
retroactive to July 1, 2003, taxable capital gains to the extent the funds have been used to purchase
a home shall not be counted as income.
    (e) The contribution shall be explained in writing to the parents at the time eligibility for services
is being determined. The contribution shall be made on a monthly basis effective with the first month
in which the child receives services. Annually upon redetermination or at termination of eligibility, if
the contribution exceeded the cost of services provided, the local agency or the state shall reimburse
that excess amount to the parents, either by direct reimbursement if the parent is no longer required
to pay a contribution, or by a reduction in or waiver of parental fees until the excess amount is
exhausted. All reimbursements must include a notice that the amount reimbursed may be taxable
income if the parent paid for the parent's fees through an employer's health care flexible spending
account under the Internal Revenue Code, section 125, and that the parent is responsible for paying
the taxes owed on the amount reimbursed.
    (f) The monthly contribution amount must be reviewed at least every 12 months; when there
is a change in household size; and when there is a loss of or gain in income from one month to
another in excess of ten percent. The local agency shall mail a written notice 30 days in advance of
the effective date of a change in the contribution amount. A decrease in the contribution amount is
effective in the month that the parent verifies a reduction in income or change in household size.
    (g) Parents of a minor child who do not live with each other shall each pay the contribution
required under paragraph (a). An amount equal to the annual court-ordered child support payment
actually paid on behalf of the child receiving services shall be deducted from the adjusted gross
income of the parent making the payment prior to calculating the parental contribution under
paragraph (b).
    (h) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be increased by an additional five percent if
the local agency determines that insurance coverage is available but not obtained for the child.
For purposes of this section, "available" means the insurance is a benefit of employment for a
family member at an annual cost of no more than five percent of the family's annual income. For
purposes of this section, "insurance" means health and accident insurance coverage, enrollment

in a nonprofit health service plan, health maintenance organization, self-insured plan, or preferred
provider organization.
    Parents who have more than one child receiving services shall not be required to pay more than
the amount for the child with the highest expenditures. There shall be no resource contribution from
the parents. The parent shall not be required to pay a contribution in excess of the cost of the services
provided to the child, not counting payments made to school districts for education-related services.
Notice of an increase in fee payment must be given at least 30 days before the increased fee is due.
  (i) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be reduced by $300 per fiscal year if, in the 12
months prior to July 1:
   (1) the parent applied for insurance for the child;
   (2) the insurer denied insurance;
    (3) the parents submitted a complaint or appeal, in writing to the insurer, submitted a complaint
or appeal, in writing, to the commissioner of health or the commissioner of commerce, or litigated
the complaint or appeal; and
   (4) as a result of the dispute, the insurer reversed its decision and granted insurance.
   For purposes of this section, "insurance" has the meaning given in paragraph (h).
    A parent who has requested a reduction in the contribution amount under this paragraph shall
submit proof in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner or county agency, including,
but not limited to, the insurer's denial of insurance, the written letter or complaint of the parents,
court documents, and the written response of the insurer approving insurance. The determinations
of the commissioner or county agency under this paragraph are not rules subject to chapter 14.
   (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), for the period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, the parental
contribution shall be computed by applying the following contribution schedule to the adjusted gross
income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to eight percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 9.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
   (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 900 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which

begins at 9.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to 12 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 900
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
    (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 900 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 13.5 percent of adjusted gross income. If the child
lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior to calculating the
parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section 256B.35, the parent is
responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section in addition to the parental
contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is reduced by any amount
required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only if actually paid.
  Sec. 7. [256.4825] REPORT REGARDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE
WITH DISABILITIES.
    The Minnesota State Council on Disability, the Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with
Disabilities, and the Arc of Minnesota may submit an annual report by January 15 of each year,
beginning in 2012, to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with
jurisdiction over programs serving people with disabilities as provided in this section. The report
must describe the existing state policies and goals for programs serving people with disabilities
including, but not limited to, programs for employment, transportation, housing, education, quality
assurance, consumer direction, physical and programmatic access, and health. The report must
provide data and measurements to assess the extent to which the policies and goals are being met.
The commissioner of human services and the commissioners of other state agencies administering
programs for people with disabilities shall cooperate with the Minnesota State Council on
Disability, the Minnesota Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, and the Arc of Minnesota and
provide those organizations with existing published information and reports that will assist in the
preparation of the report.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.9657, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. ICF/MR license surcharge. (a) Effective July 1, 2003, each non-state-operated
facility as defined under section 256B.501, subdivision 1, shall pay to the commissioner an annual
surcharge according to the schedule in subdivision 4, paragraph (d). The annual surcharge shall be
$1,040 per licensed bed. If the number of licensed beds is reduced, the surcharge shall be based
on the number of remaining licensed beds the second month following the receipt of timely notice
by the commissioner of human services that beds have been delicensed. The facility must notify
the commissioner of health in writing when beds are delicensed. The commissioner of health
must notify the commissioner of human services within ten working days after receiving written
notification. If the notification is received by the commissioner of human services by the 15th of the
month, the invoice for the second following month must be reduced to recognize the delicensing
of beds. The commissioner may reduce, and may subsequently restore, the surcharge under this
subdivision based on the commissioner's determination of a permissible surcharge.
   (b) Effective July 1, 2010, the surcharge under paragraph (a) is increased to $4,037 per licensed
bed.

2013, no rate adjustments shall be implemented under this section, but shall be determined under
section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2013, the operating payment rate for
each facility shall be 65 percent of the operating payment rate from this section, and 35 percent of
the operating payment rate from section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2014,
the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 82 percent of the operating payment rate from
this section, and 18 percent of the operating payment rate from section 256B.434. For the rate
year beginning October 1, 2015, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be the operating
payment rate determined under this section. The blending of operating payment rates under this
section shall be performed separately for each RUG's class.
   (b) For the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the commissioner shall apply limits to the
operating payment rate increases under paragraph (a) by creating a minimum percentage increase
and a maximum percentage increase.
    (1) Each nursing facility that receives a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase
under paragraph (a) of less than one percent, when compared to its operating payment rate on
September 30, 2008, computed using rates with RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive a rate adjustment
of one percent.
    (2) The commissioner shall determine a maximum percentage increase that will result in savings
equal to the cost of allowing the minimum increase in clause (1). Nursing facilities with a blended
October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under paragraph (a) greater than the maximum
percentage increase determined by the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment
rate on September 30, 2008, computed using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the
maximum percentage increase.
    (3) Nursing facilities with a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under
paragraph (a) greater than one percent and less than the maximum percentage increase determined by
the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment rate on September 30, 2008, computed
using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the blended October 1, 2008, operating
payment rate increase determined under paragraph (a).
    (4) The October 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, operating payment rate for facilities receiving
the maximum percentage increase determined in clause (2) shall be the amount determined under

paragraph (a) less the difference between the amount determined under paragraph (a) for October 1,
2008, and the amount allowed under clause (2). This rate restriction does not apply to rate increases
provided in any other section.
   (c) A portion of the funds received under this subdivision that are in excess of operating
payment rates that a facility would have received under section 256B.434, as determined in
accordance with clauses (1) to (3), shall be subject to the requirements in section 256B.434,
subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h).
    (1) Determine the amount of additional funding available to a facility, which shall be equal
to total medical assistance resident days from the most recent reporting year times the difference
between the blended rate determined in paragraph (a) for the rate year being computed and the
blended rate for the prior year.
   (2) Determine the portion of all operating costs, for the most recent reporting year, that are
compensation related. If this value exceeds 75 percent, use 75 percent.
   (3) Subtract the amount determined in clause (2) from 75 percent.
    (4) The portion of the fund received under this subdivision that shall be subject to the
requirements in section 256B.434, subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h), shall equal the amount
determined in clause (1) times the amount determined in clause (3).

increase.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 1, 2010.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions

be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
   (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating

A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods ­                      fo

and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, and representatives of counties, residents' advocacy
groups, consumers of housing services, and provider agencies shall explore ways to maximize the
availability and affordability of housing choices available to persons with disabilities or who need
care assistance due to other health challenges. A goal shall also be to minimize state physical plant
costs in order to serve more persons with appropriate program and care support. Consideration shall
be given to:

is met:
   (1) for families receiving MFIP assistance on July 1, 2003, the child is born to the adult parent
before May 1, 2004;
    (2) for families who apply for the diversionary work program under section 256J.95 or MFIP
assistance on or after July 1, 2003, the child is born to the adult parent within ten months of the date
the family is eligible for assistance;
   (3) the child was conceived as a result of a sexual assault or incest, provided that the incident
has been reported to a law enforcement agency;
    (4) the child's mother is a minor caregiver as defined in section 256J.08, subdivision 59, and the
child, or multiple children, are the mother's first birth; ­

included if the adult parent or parents have not received benefits from the diversionary work
program under section 256J.95 or MFIP assistance in the previous ten months. An adult parent
or parents who reapply and have received benefits from the diversionary work program or MFIP

    (b) To be eligible for work participation cash benefits, the participant shall not receive MFIP
or diversionary work program assistance during the month and the participant or participants must
meet the following work requirements:
  (1) if the participant is a single caregiver and has a child under six years of age, the participant

meets the other criteria in this section, work participation cash benefits are available for up to 24
consecutive months.
    (c) Expenditures on the program are maintenance of effort state funds under a separate state
program for participants under paragraph (b), clauses (1) and (2). Expenditures for participants

receives work participation cash benefits under this section do not count toward the participant's
MFIP 60-month time limit.

financial burden on the insured or enrollee than those requirements applied by the health plan to other
similar services or benefits. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a health plan company from
requiring prior authorization by the health plan company for such services as required by section
256B.0625, subdivision 7, or use of contracted providers under the applicable provisions of the
health plan.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to health plans offered,
sold, issued, or renewed on or after that date.

Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, for eligible vendors. These rates shall supersede rates set
in county purchase of service agreements when payments are made on behalf of clients eligible
according to Public Law 94-437.
   Sec. 15. [254B.13] PILOT PROJECTS; CHEMICAL HEALTH CARE.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization for pilot projects. The commissioner may approve and
implement pilot projects developed under the planning process required under Laws 2009, chapter
79, article 7, section 26, to provide alternatives to and enhance coordination of the delivery of
chemical health services required under section 254B.03.
    Subd. 2. Program design and implementation. (a) The commissioner and counties
participating in the pilot projects shall continue to work in partnership to refine and implement the
pilot projects initiated under Laws 2009, chapter 79, article 7, section 26.
    (b) The commissioner and counties participating in the pilot projects shall complete the
planning phase by June 30, 2010, and, if approved by the commissioner for implementation, enter
into agreements governing the operation of the pilot projects with implementation scheduled no
earlier than July 1, 2010.
    Subd. 3. Program evaluation. The commissioner shall evaluate pilot projects under this section
and report the results of the evaluation to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over chemical health issues by January 15, 2013. Evaluation of the
pilot projects must be based on outcome evaluation criteria negotiated with the pilot projects prior
to implementation.
    Subd. 4. Notice of project discontinuation. Each county's participation in the pilot project may
be discontinued for any reason by the county or the commissioner of human services after 30 days'
written notice to the other party. Any unspent funds held for the exiting county's pro rata share in the
special revenue fund under the authority in subdivision 5, paragraph (d), shall be transferred to the
consolidated chemical dependency treatment fund following discontinuation of the pilot project.
   Subd. 5. Duties of commissioner. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this chapter, the
commissioner may authorize pilot projects to use chemical dependency treatment funds to pay for
nontreatment pilot services:
   (1) in addition to those authorized under section 254B.03, subdivision 2, paragraph (a); and
   (2) by vendors in addition to those authorized under section 254B.05 when not providing
chemical dependency treatment services.
   (b) For purposes of this section, "nontreatment pilot services" include navigator services, peer
support, family engagement and support, housing support, rent subsidies, supported employment,
and independent living skills.
    (c) State expenditures for chemical dependency services and nontreatment pilot services
provided by or through the pilot projects must not be greater than the chemical dependency
treatment fund expected share of forecasted expenditures in the absence of the pilot projects.
The commissioner may restructure the schedule of payments between the state and participating
counties under the local agency share and division of cost provisions under section 254B.03,
subdivisions 3 and 4, as necessary to facilitate the operation of the pilot projects.

    (d) To the extent that state fiscal year expenditures within a pilot project are less than the expected
share of forecasted expenditures in the absence of the pilot projects, the commissioner shall deposit
the unexpended funds in a separate account within the consolidated chemical dependency treatment
fund, and make these funds available for expenditure by the pilot projects the following year. To the
extent that treatment and nontreatment pilot services expenditures within the pilot project exceed
the amount expected in the absence of the pilot projects, the pilot project county or counties are
responsible for the portion of nontreatment pilot services expenditures in excess of the otherwise
expected share of forecasted expenditures.
    (e) The commissioner may waive administrative rule requirements that are incompatible with the
implementation of the pilot project, except that any chemical dependency treatment funded under
this section must continue to be provided by a licensed treatment provider.
   (f) The commissioner shall not approve or enter into any agreement related to pilot projects
authorized under this section that puts current or future federal funding at risk.
   Subd. 6. Duties of county board. The county board, or other county entity that is approved to
administer a pilot project, shall:
   (1) administer the pilot project in a manner consistent with the objectives described in
subdivision 2 and the planning process in subdivision 5;
   (2) ensure that no one is denied chemical dependency treatment services for which they would
otherwise be eligible under section 254A.03, subdivision 3; and
   (3) provide the commissioner with timely and pertinent information as negotiated in agreements
governing operation of the pilot projects.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to

If one party is unable to appear in person, the party appearing may complete the absent applicant's
information. The local registrar shall provide a copy of the marriage application to the party who is
unable to appear, who must verify the accuracy of the party's information in a notarized statement.
The marriage license must not be released until the verification statement has been received by
the local registrar. If at the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal
impediment to it, including the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue
the license, containing the full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state
of residence, with the county seal attached, and make a record of the date of issuance. The license
shall be valid for a period of six months. Except as provided in paragraph (c), the local registrar
shall collect from the applicant a fee of ­  $1

and filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics
the reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period
of six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.

    (b) In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of the
county in which the application is made may authorize the license to be issued at any time before
expiration of the five-day period required under paragraph (a). A waiver of the five-day waiting
period must be in the following form:

    After reviewing the above application, I am satisfied that an emergency or extraordinary

    (c) The marriage license fee for parties who have completed at least 12 hours of premarital
education is $40. In order to qualify for the reduced license fee, the parties must submit at the time
of applying for the marriage license a signed, dated, and notarized statement from the person who
provided the premarital education on their letterhead confirming that it was received. The premarital
education must be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's designee, a person
authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized to practice marriage
and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use of a premarital
inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)
received at least 12 hours of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory
and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request.

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.605, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Designation; reverification. The commissioner shall designate ­              f­
                                                                                           ou r six levels of

trauma hospitals. A hospital that voluntarily meets the criteria for a particular level of trauma
hospital shall apply to the commissioner for designation and, upon the commissioner's verifying the
hospital meets the criteria, be designated a trauma hospital at the appropriate level for a three-year
period. Prior to the expiration of the three-year designation, a hospital seeking to remain part of the
voluntary system must apply for and successfully complete a reverification process, be awaiting
the site visit for the reverification, or be awaiting the results of the site visit. The commissioner may
extend a hospital's existing designation for up to 18 months on a provisional basis if the hospital
has applied for reverification in a timely manner but has not yet completed the reverification
process within the expiration of the three-year designation and the extension is in the best interest
of trauma system patient safety. To be granted a provisional extension, the hospital must be:
    (1) scheduled and awaiting the site visit for reverification;
    (2) awaiting the results of the site visit; or
    (3) responding to and correcting identified deficiencies identified in the site visit.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.605, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. ACS verification. The commissioner shall grant the appropriate level I, II, or III
trauma hospital or level I or II pediatric trauma hospital designation to a hospital that successfully
completes and passes the American College of Surgeons (ACS) verification standards at the
hospital's cost, submits verification documentation to the Trauma Advisory Council, and formally
notifies the Trauma Advisory Council of ACS verification.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144.605, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Designation process protection. Data on patients in information and reports related
to the designation and redesignation of trauma hospitals pursuant to subdivisions 3 to 5 are private
data on individuals, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12.
    Sec. 12. [144.6071] TRAUMA REGISTRY.
    Subdivision 1. Registry. The commissioner of health shall establish and maintain a central
registry of persons who sustain major trauma as defined in section 144.602, subdivision 3. The
registry shall collect information to facilitate the development of clinical and system quality
improvement, injury prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs.
    Subd. 2. Registry participation required. A trauma hospital must participate in the statewide
trauma registry. The consent of the injured person is not required.
    Subd. 3. Registry information. Trauma hospitals must electronically submit the following
information to the registry:
    (1) demographic information of the injured person;
    (2) information about the date, location, and cause of the injury;
    (3) information about the condition of the injured person;

   (4) information about the treatment, comorbidities, and diagnosis of the injured person;
   (5) information about the outcome and disposition of the injured person; and
   (6) other trauma-related information required by the commissioner, if necessary to facilitate the
development of clinical and system quality improvement, treatment, and rehabilitation programs.
    Subd. 4. Rules. The commissioner may adopt rules to collect other information required to
facilitate the development of clinical and system quality improvement, injury prevention, treatment,
and rehabilitation programs. The commissioner may adopt rules at any time to implement this
section and is not subject to the requirements of section 14.125.
    Subd. 5. Reporting without liability. Any person or facility furnishing information required in
this section shall not be subject to any action for damages or other relief, provided that the person
or facility is acting in good faith.
    Subd. 6. Data classification. Data on individuals collected by the commissioner of health under
this section are private data on individuals, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12. Data not on
individuals are nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9. The commissioner shall
provide summary registry data to public and private entities to conduct studies using data collected
by the registry. The commissioner may charge a fee under section 13.03, subdivision 3, for all
out-of-pocket expenses associated with the provision of data or data analysis.
    Subd. 7. Report requirements. The commissioner shall use the registry to annually publish a
report that includes comparative demographic and risk-adjusted epidemiological data on designated
trauma hospitals. Any analyses or reports that identify providers may only be published after the
provider has been provided the opportunity by the commissioner to review the underlying data and
submit comments. The provider shall have 21 days to review the data for accuracy.
