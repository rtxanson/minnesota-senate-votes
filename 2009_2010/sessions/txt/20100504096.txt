    Page 1, after line 24, insert:
    "Up to 2.5 percent of the money appropriated to the commissioner of public safety in clauses
(1) and (2) may be used by the department to administer the authorized grants."
    The question was taken on the adoption of the Latz amendment to the Latz amendment.

    Subd. 3. Provider peer grouping. (a) The commissioner shall develop a peer grouping system
for providers based on a combined measure that incorporates both provider risk-adjusted cost of care
and quality of care, and for specific conditions as determined by the commissioner. In developing
this system, the commissioner shall consult and coordinate with health care providers, health plan
companies, state agencies, and organizations that work to improve health care quality in Minnesota.
For purposes of the final establishment of the peer grouping system, the commissioner shall not
contract with any private entity, organization, or consortium of entities that has or will have a direct
financial interest in the outcome of the system.

regarding the accuracy of the data used to develop analyses or reports. When a provider appeals
the accuracy of the data used to calculate the peer grouping system results, the provider shall:
    (1) clearly indicate the reason they believe the data used to calculate the peer group system
results are not accurate;
   (2) provide evidence and documentation to support the reason that data was not accurate; and
   (3) cooperate with the commissioner, including allowing the commissioner access to data
necessary and relevant to resolving the dispute.

performance results shall include, at a minimum, the following:
   (1) use of the best available evidence, research, and methodologies; and
    (2) establishment of an explicit minimum reliability threshold developed in collaboration with
the subjects of the data and the users of the data, at a level not below nationally accepted standards
where such standards exist.
In achieving these thresholds, the commissioner shall not aggregate clinics that are not part of the
same system or practice group. The commissioner shall consult with and solicit feedback from
representatives of physician clinics and hospitals during the peer grouping data analysis process to
obtain input on the methodological options prior to final analysis and on the design, development,
and testing of provider reports.

monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic

separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.

provided in a patient's home or community setting, in addition to other authorized settings. The
commissioner may waive existing payment policies and establish special payment rates for the
pilot project. The pilot project must be designed to produce a net savings to the state compared to

participation in the demonstration project in consultation with hospitals, primary care providers,
health plans, and other key stakeholders.
   (b) In developing the request for proposals, the commissioner shall:
   (1) establish uniform statewide methods of forecasting total cost of care to be used by the
commissioner for the health care delivery system projects;
    (2) identify key indicators of quality, access, patient satisfaction, and other performance
indicators that will be measured, in addition to indicators for measuring cost savings;
    (3) allow maximum flexibility to encourage innovation and variation so that a variety of provider
collaborations are able to become health care delivery systems if they are willing and able to be
held accountable for the total cost of care and quality and performance standards established by the
commissioner;
   (4) encourage and authorize different levels and types of financial risk;
   (5) encourage and authorize projects representing a wide variety of geographic locations, patient
populations, provider relationships, and care coordination models;

community health workers.
    (d) A health care delivery system may be formed by a county, an integrated delivery system or
network, a physician-hospital organization, an academic center, a county-based purchasing plan,
a managed care plan, or other entity. A health care delivery system may contract with a managed
care plan or a county-based purchasing plan to provide administrative services, including the
administration of a payment system using the payment methods established by the commissioner
for health care delivery systems.
   Subd. 2. Enrollment. (a) Initially, individuals eligible for medical assistance under section
256B.055, subdivision 15, shall be eligible for enrollment in a health care delivery system.

centers, and rural clinics to the extent practicable.
    Subd. 4. Payment system. (a) In developing a payment system for health care delivery systems,
the commissioner shall establish a total cost of care benchmark to be paid for services provided to
the recipients enrolled in a health care delivery system. The commissioner shall establish a payment
arrangement with the health care delivery system to provide these services during the specified
time period at a cost that is equal to or less than 97 percent of the forecasted total cost of care for
the enrollee population using predetermined payments for the recipients enrolled in the health care
delivery system rather than fee-for-service methods that pay for units of service. The actual amount
to be paid may be negotiated, but may not exceed 97 percent of the forecasted cost.
   (b) The payment system may include incentive payments to health care delivery systems that
meet or exceed annual quality and performance targets realized through the coordination of care.
   (c) An amount equal to the savings realized to the general fund as a result of the demonstration
project shall be transferred each fiscal year to the health care access fund.
    Subd. 5. Hennepin and Ramsey Counties Pilot Program. (a) The commissioner, upon federal
approval of a new waiver request or amendment of an existing demonstration, may establish a
pilot program in Hennepin County or Ramsey County, or both, to test alternative and innovative
integrated health care delivery networks.

delivery network in Ramsey County shall be a network, such as an accountable care organization
or community-based collaborative care network, created by or including Regions Hospital.
   (d) The commissioner shall cap pilot program enrollment at 7,000 enrollees for Hennepin County
and 3,500 enrollees for Ramsey County.
    (e) In developing a payment system for the pilot programs, the commissioner shall establish a
total cost of care for the recipients enrolled in the pilot programs that equals the cost of care that
would otherwise be spent for these enrollees in the prepaid medical assistance program.
    (f) Counties may transfer funds necessary to support the nonfederal share of payments for
integrated health care delivery networks in their county. Such transfers per county shall not exceed
15 percent of the expected expenses for county enrollees.
    (g) The commissioner shall apply to the federal government for, or as appropriate, cooperate

        ) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments and county-based purchasing plan payments under this
section pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable,
objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based
on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be
outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and
no later than July 31 of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. A   ­­­

Senior LinkAge Line for long-term care options counseling and transitional consultation. The
Senior LinkAge Line shall provide a certificate to the prospective resident and also send a copy
of the certificate to the housing with services establishment that the prospective resident chooses,
verifying that consultation has been provided. The housing with services establishment shall not
execute a contract or allow a prospective resident to move in until the establishment has received
certification from the Senior LinkAge Line. The housing with services establishment shall maintain
copies of contracts and certificates for audit for a period of three years. The purpose of transitional
long-term care consultation is to support persons with current or anticipated long-term care needs
in making informed choices among options that include the most cost-effective and least restrictive
settings, and to delay spenddown to eligibility for publicly funded programs by connecting people
to alternative services in their homes before transition to housing with services. Regardless of the
consultation, prospective residents maintain the right to choose housing with services or assisted
living if that option is their preference.

2013, no rate adjustments shall be implemented under this section, but shall be determined under
section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2013, the operating payment rate for
each facility shall be 65 percent of the operating payment rate from this section, and 35 percent of
the operating payment rate from section 256B.434. For the rate year beginning October 1, 2014,
the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 82 percent of the operating payment rate from
this section, and 18 percent of the operating payment rate from section 256B.434. For the rate
year beginning October 1, 2015, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be the operating
payment rate determined under this section. The blending of operating payment rates under this
section shall be performed separately for each RUG's class.
   (b) For the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the commissioner shall apply limits to the
operating payment rate increases under paragraph (a) by creating a minimum percentage increase
and a maximum percentage increase.
   (1) Each nursing facility that receives a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase
under paragraph (a) of less than one percent, when compared to its operating payment rate on
September 30, 2008, computed using rates with RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive a rate adjustment

of one percent.
    (2) The commissioner shall determine a maximum percentage increase that will result in savings
equal to the cost of allowing the minimum increase in clause (1). Nursing facilities with a blended
October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under paragraph (a) greater than the maximum
percentage increase determined by the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment
rate on September 30, 2008, computed using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the
maximum percentage increase.
    (3) Nursing facilities with a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under
paragraph (a) greater than one percent and less than the maximum percentage increase determined by
the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment rate on September 30, 2008, computed
using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the blended October 1, 2008, operating
payment rate increase determined under paragraph (a).
    (4) The October 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, operating payment rate for facilities receiving
the maximum percentage increase determined in clause (2) shall be the amount determined under
paragraph (a) less the difference between the amount determined under paragraph (a) for October 1,
2008, and the amount allowed under clause (2). This rate restriction does not apply to rate increases
provided in any other section.
   (c) A portion of the funds received under this subdivision that are in excess of operating
payment rates that a facility would have received under section 256B.434, as determined in
accordance with clauses (1) to (3), shall be subject to the requirements in section 256B.434,
subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h).
    (1) Determine the amount of additional funding available to a facility, which shall be equal
to total medical assistance resident days from the most recent reporting year times the difference
between the blended rate determined in paragraph (a) for the rate year being computed and the
blended rate for the prior year.
   (2) Determine the portion of all operating costs, for the most recent reporting year, that are
compensation related. If this value exceeds 75 percent, use 75 percent.
   (3) Subtract the amount determined in clause (2) from 75 percent.
    (4) The portion of the fund received under this subdivision that shall be subject to the
requirements in section 256B.434, subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h), shall equal the amount
determined in clause (1) times the amount determined in clause (3).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactive to October 1, 2009.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.49, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 23. Living arrangements. The commissioner shall not place a limit, without express
legislative approval, on the number of adult recipients of home and community-based waivered
services receiving assisted living plus services or customized living services who may reside in
one building, regardless of adult recipient age. Limits in effect on May 1, 2001, on the number of
recipients who may reside in one living unit shall remain in effect, regardless of the number of units
in a building. The commissioner shall not deny medical assistance enrollment based on building
capacity to an otherwise-qualified provider of waivered services.

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.5012, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 9. Rate increase effective June 1, 2010. For rate periods beginning on or after June 1,
2010, the commissioner shall increase the total operating payment rate for each facility reimbursed
under this section by $8.74 per day. The increase shall not be subject to any annual percentage
increase.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 1, 2010.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
   (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
10238                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [96TH DAY

ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO

programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have
been incurred under the fee-for-service program. Notwithstanding whether expansion occurs under
this paragraph, in determining MnDHO payment rates and risk adjustment methods ­                      fo

who is disqualified on the basis of a preponderance of evidence that the individual committed an act
or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; for a determination
under section 626.556 or 626.557 of substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring under
section 245C.15; or for failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3; or
626.557, subdivision 3, pursuant to section 245C.15, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (1), the
individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the disqualification is deemed
conclusive under section 245C.29.
   (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the

right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction of, admission to, or Alford Plea to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions
1 to 4, or for a disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision
under section 245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified
individual and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified
based on a judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for
purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.

disqualification of an individual who was disqualified based on both a preponderance of evidence
and a conviction or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045,
unless the disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the
hearing conducted under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction
or admission shall be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to
section 256.045, subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22
is not the final agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245C.27, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Consolidated fair hearing. (a) If an individual who is disqualified on the bases of
serious or recurring maltreatment requests a fair hearing on the maltreatment determination under
section 626.556, subdivision 10i, or 626.557, subdivision 9d, and requests a fair hearing under this
                                                    s­

under section 256.045 shall include the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
    (b) A fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination. The
disqualified individual does not have the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data
under section 13.04.
    (c) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.

the disqualification of an individual who is an employee of an employer, as defined in section
179A.03, subdivision 15, the individual may request a contested case hearing under chapter 14,
unless the disqualification is deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The request for a contested
case hearing must be made in writing and must be postmarked and sent within 30 calendar days
after the employee receives notice that the disqualification has not been ­ s­

the individual was disqualified based on a conviction or admission to any crimes listed in section
245C.15, the scope of the contested case hearing shall be limited solely to whether the individual
poses a risk of harm pursuant to section 245C.22.

determination and the disqualification. In such cases, a fair hearing must not be conducted under
section 256.045.
     (c) If the commissioner does not rescind a disqualification that is based on a preponderance of
evidence that the individual committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes
listed in section 245C.15, the scope of the contested case hearing must include the disqualification
decision. In such cases, a fair hearing must not be conducted under section 256.045.

law judge shall consider all of the characteristics that cause the individual to be disqualified in
order to determine whether the individual poses a risk of harm. The administrative law judge's
recommendation and the commissioner's order to set aside a disqualification that is the subject of
the hearing constitutes a determination that the individual does not pose a risk of harm and that the
individual may provide direct contact services in the individual program specified in the set aside.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256.045, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. State agency hearings. (a) State agency hearings are available for the following:
    (1) any person applying for, receiving or having received public assistance, medical care, or
a program of social services granted by the state agency or a county agency or the federal Food
Stamp Act whose application for assistance is denied, not acted upon with reasonable promptness,
or whose assistance is suspended, reduced, terminated, or claimed to have been incorrectly paid;
   (2) any patient or relative aggrieved by an order of the commissioner under section 252.27;
   (3) a party aggrieved by a ruling of a prepaid health plan;
    (4) except as provided under chapter 245C, any individual or facility determined by a lead agency
to have maltreated a vulnerable adult under section 626.557 after they have exercised their right to
administrative reconsideration under section 626.557;
    (5) any person whose claim for foster care payment according to a placement of the child
resulting from a child protection assessment under section 626.556 is denied or not acted upon
with reasonable promptness, regardless of funding source;
    (6) any person to whom a right of appeal according to this section is given by other provision
of law;
    (7) an applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision to an application for a hardship waiver under
section 256B.15;
   (8) an applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision to an application or redetermination for a

Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy under section 256B.04, subdivision 4a;
   (9) except as provided under chapter 245A, an individual or facility determined to have
maltreated a minor under section 626.556, after the individual or facility has exercised the right to
administrative reconsideration under section 626.556;
     (10) except as provided under chapter 245C, an individual disqualified under sections 245C.14
and 245C.15, which has not been ­   s­

basis of serious or recurring maltreatment; a preponderance of the evidence that the individual has
committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15,
subdivisions 1 to 4; or for failing to make reports required under section 626.556, subdivision 3,
or 626.557, subdivision 3. Hearings regarding a maltreatment determination under clause (4) or
(9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for a disqualification is serious or
recurring maltreatment, which has not been ­  s­

shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of review by the human
services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the disqualification. The
failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be a bar to a hearing
under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to dispute a finding
of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest the specified
action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written request for a
hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action, decision,
or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or
relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time limit; or
    (11) any person with an outstanding debt resulting from receipt of public assistance, medical
care, or the federal Food Stamp Act who is contesting a setoff claim by the Department of Human
Services or a county agency. The scope of the appeal is the validity of the claimant agency's intention
to request a setoff of a refund under chapter 270A against the debt.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.
   (c) For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
    (d) The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under paragraph (a), clause
(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement
under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care

payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.
   (e) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.
   (f) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (g) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.24, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Family cap. (a) MFIP assistance units shall not receive an increase in the cash portion
of the transitional standard as a result of the birth of a child, unless one of the conditions under
paragraph (b) is met. The child shall be considered a member of the assistance unit according to
subdivisions 1 to 3, but shall be excluded in determining family size for purposes of determining
the amount of the cash portion of the transitional standard under subdivision 5. The child shall be
included in determining family size for purposes of determining the food portion of the transitional
standard. The transitional standard under this subdivision shall be the total of the cash and food
portions as specified in this paragraph. The family wage level under this subdivision shall be based
on the family size used to determine the food portion of the transitional standard.
    (b) A child shall be included in determining family size for purposes of determining the amount
of the cash portion of the MFIP transitional standard when at least one of the following conditions
is met:
   (1) for families receiving MFIP assistance on July 1, 2003, the child is born to the adult parent
before May 1, 2004;
    (2) for families who apply for the diversionary work program under section 256J.95 or MFIP
assistance on or after July 1, 2003, the child is born to the adult parent within ten months of the date
the family is eligible for assistance;
    (3) the child was conceived as a result of a sexual assault or incest, provided that the incident

has been reported to a law enforcement agency;
    (4) the child's mother is a minor caregiver as defined in section 256J.08, subdivision 59, and the
child, or multiple children, are the mother's first birth; ­
                                                           o­r
    (5) the child is the mother's first child subsequent to a pregnancy that did not result in a live
birth; or
    (6) any child previously excluded in determining family size under paragraph (a) shall be
included if the adult parent or parents have not received benefits from the diversionary work
program under section 256J.95 or MFIP assistance in the previous ten months. An adult parent
or parents who reapply and have received benefits from the diversionary work program or MFIP
assistance in the past ten months shall be under the ten-month grace period of their previous
application under clause (2).
    (c) Income and resources of a child excluded under this subdivision, except child support
received or distributed on behalf of this child, must be considered using the same policies as for
other children when determining the grant amount of the assistance unit.
    (d) The caregiver must assign support and cooperate with the child support enforcement agency
to establish paternity and collect child support on behalf of the excluded child. Failure to cooperate
results in the sanction specified in section 256J.46, subdivisions 2 and 2a. Current support paid on
behalf of the excluded child shall be distributed according to section 256.741, subdivision 15.
    (e) County agencies must inform applicants of the provisions under this subdivision at the time
of each application and at recertification.
    (f) Children excluded under this provision shall be deemed MFIP recipients for purposes of child
care under chapter 119B.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective September 1, 2010.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256J.425, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. Hard-to-employ participants. (a) An assistance unit subject to the time limit in section
256J.42, subdivision 1, is eligible to receive months of assistance under a hardship extension if the
participant who reached the time limit belongs to any of the following groups:
   (1) a person who is diagnosed by a licensed physician, psychological practitioner, or other
qualified professional, as developmentally disabled or mentally ill, and the condition severely
limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment;
   (2) a person who:
   (i) has been assessed by a vocational specialist or the county agency to be unemployable for
purposes of this subdivision; or
    (ii) has an IQ below 80 who has been assessed by a vocational specialist or a county agency to
be employable, but the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable
employment. The determination of IQ level must be made by a qualified professional. In the case
of a non-English-speaking person: (A) the determination must be made by a qualified professional

with experience conducting culturally appropriate assessments, whenever possible; (B) the county
may accept reports that identify an IQ range as opposed to a specific score; (C) these reports must
include a statement of confidence in the results;
    (3) a person who is determined by a qualified professional to be learning disabled, and the
condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment. For
purposes of the initial approval of a learning disability extension, the determination must have been
made or confirmed within the previous 12 months. In the case of a non-English-speaking person: (i)
the determination must be made by a qualified professional with experience conducting culturally
appropriate assessments, whenever possible; and (ii) these reports must include a statement of
confidence in the results. If a rehabilitation plan for a participant extended as learning disabled is
developed or approved by the county agency, the plan must be incorporated into the employment
plan. However, a rehabilitation plan does not replace the requirement to develop and comply with
an employment plan under section 256J.521; or
  (4) a person who has been granted a family violence waiver, and who is complying with an
employment plan under section 256J.521, subdivision 3.

                                       ­ chapter, "severely limits the person's ability to obtain or
maintain suitable employment" means: (1) that a qualified professional has determined that the
person's condition prevents the person from working 20 or more hours per week; or (2) for a person
who meets the requirements of paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), or paragraph (a), clause (3), of
this subdivision, a qualified professional has determined: (i) the person's condition significantly
restricts the range of employment that the person is able to perform; or (ii) significantly interferes
with the person's ability to obtain or maintain employment for 20 or more hours per week.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.556, subdivision 10i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10i. Administrative reconsideration; review panel. (a) Administrative reconsideration
is not applicable in family assessments since no determination concerning maltreatment is made.
For investigations, except as provided under paragraph (e), an individual or facility that the
commissioner of human services, a local social service agency, or the commissioner of education
determines has maltreated a child, an interested person acting on behalf of the child, regardless
of the determination, who contests the investigating agency's final determination regarding
maltreatment, may request the investigating agency to reconsider its final determination regarding
maltreatment. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the investigating
agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice of the final determination regarding
maltreatment or, if the request is made by an interested person who is not entitled to notice, within
15 days after receipt of the notice by the parent or guardian of the child. If mailed, the request for
reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency within 15 calendar days
of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. If the request for reconsideration
is made by personal service, it must be received by the investigating agency within 15 calendar
days after the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. Effective January 1,
2002, an individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under this section and who
was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification
under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of the maltreatment
10246                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [96TH DAY

determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the maltreatment determination and notice of
disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the investigating agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the investigating agency denies the request
or fails to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration,
the person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045 may submit to the commissioner
of human services or the commissioner of education a written request for a hearing under that
section. Section 256.045 also governs hearings requested to contest a final determination of the
commissioner of education. For reports involving maltreatment of a child in a facility, an interested
person acting on behalf of the child may request a review by the Child Maltreatment Review Panel
under section 256.022 if the investigating agency denies the request or fails to act upon the request
or if the interested person contests a reconsidered determination. The investigating agency shall
notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under this paragraph. The request must
be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the investigating agency within 30
calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration or of a reconsidered
determination. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency determination with
which the person is dissatisfied.
    (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the investigating agency changes the final
determination of maltreatment, that agency shall notify the parties specified in subdivisions 10b,
10d, and 10f.
    (d) Except as provided under paragraph (f), if an individual or facility contests the investigating
agency's final determination regarding maltreatment by requesting a fair hearing under section
256.045, the commissioner of human services shall assure that the hearing is conducted and a
decision is reached within 90 days of receipt of the request for a hearing. The time for action on
the decision may be extended for as many days as the hearing is postponed or the record is held
open for the benefit of either party.

the individual has requested reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph
(a) and requested reconsideration of the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27,
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and reconsideration of the disqualification shall

individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing
on the maltreatment determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall
include both the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.

conducted under section 256.045. Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration
of a maltreatment determination as provided under this subdivision, and reconsideration of a
disqualification as provided under section 245C.22, shall also not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under section

law judge.
    (g) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the child" means a
parent or legal guardian; stepparent; grandparent; guardian ad litem; adult stepbrother, stepsister, or

    Subd. 9d. Administrative reconsideration; review panel. (a) Except as provided under
paragraph (e), any individual or facility which a lead agency determines has maltreated a vulnerable
adult, or the vulnerable adult or an interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult,
regardless of the lead agency's determination, who contests the lead agency's final disposition of
an allegation of maltreatment, may request the lead agency to reconsider its final disposition. The
request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the lead agency within 15 calendar days
after receipt of notice of final disposition or, if the request is made by an interested person who
is not entitled to notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the vulnerable adult or the
vulnerable adult's legal guardian. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and
sent to the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final
disposition. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the
lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final disposition.
An individual who was determined to have maltreated a vulnerable adult under this section and
who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must

be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the lead
agency within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification. If the
request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the lead agency
within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the lead agency denies the request or fails
to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration, the
person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045, may submit to the commissioner
of human services a written request for a hearing under that statute. The vulnerable adult, or an
interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult, may request a review by the Vulnerable
Adult Maltreatment Review Panel under section 256.021 if the lead agency denies the request or
fails to act upon the request, or if the vulnerable adult or interested person contests a reconsidered
disposition. The lead agency shall notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under
this paragraph. The request must be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the
lead agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration
or of a reconsidered disposition. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency
determination with which the person is dissatisfied.
   (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the lead agency changes the final disposition, it
shall notify the parties specified in subdivision 9c, paragraph (d).
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult"
means a person designated in writing by the vulnerable adult to act on behalf of the vulnerable
adult, or a legal guardian or conservator or other legal representative, a proxy or health care agent
appointed under chapter 145B or 145C, or an individual who is related to the vulnerable adult, as
defined in section 245A.02, subdivision 13.
    (e) If an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, on the basis of a
determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and the individual has requested
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph (a) and reconsideration of
the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and requested reconsideration of the disqualification shall be consolidated into a
single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination is denied or if the
disqualification is not ­s­

may request a fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
    (f) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on serious or recurring
maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction
under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14
and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for under section 245A.08, the
scope of the contested case hearing must include the maltreatment determination, disqualification,

under section 256.045. Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a
maltreatment determination under this subdivision, and reconsideration of a disqualification under
section 245C.22, must not be conducted when:

    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration

background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) Until August 1, 2002, an individual or facility that was determined by the commissioner of
human services or the commissioner of health to be responsible for neglect under section 626.5572,
subdivision 17, after October 1, 1995, and before August 1, 2001, that believes that the finding
of neglect does not meet an amended definition of neglect may request a reconsideration of the
determination of neglect. The commissioner of human services or the commissioner of health shall
mail a notice to the last known address of individuals who are eligible to seek this reconsideration.
The request for reconsideration must state how the established findings no longer meet the elements
of the definition of neglect. The commissioner shall review the request for reconsideration and make
a determination within 15 calendar days. The commissioner's decision on this reconsideration is the
final agency action.
   (1) For purposes of compliance with the data destruction schedule under subdivision 12b,
paragraph (d), when a finding of substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a
reconsideration under this paragraph, the date of the original finding of a substantiated maltreatment
must be used to calculate the destruction date.
    (2) For purposes of any background studies under chapter 245C, when a determination of
substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a reconsideration under this paragraph,
any prior disqualification of the individual under chapter 245C that was based on this determination
of maltreatment shall be rescinded, and for future background studies under chapter 245C the
commissioner must not use the previous determination of substantiated maltreatment as a basis for
disqualification or as a basis for referring the individual's maltreatment history to a health-related
licensing board under section 245C.31.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62J.692, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Distribution of funds. (a) Following the distribution described under paragraph (b),
the commissioner shall annually distribute the available medical education funds to all qualifying
applicants based on a distribution formula that reflects a summation of two factors:
    (1) a public program volume factor, which is determined by the total volume of public program
revenue received by each training site as a percentage of all public program revenue received by all
training sites in the fund pool; and
    (2) a supplemental public program volume factor, which is determined by providing a
supplemental payment of 20 percent of each training site's grant to training sites whose public
program revenue accounted for at least 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received
by all eligible training sites. Grants to training sites whose public program revenue accounted for
less than 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received by all eligible training sites
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total value of the supplemental payment.
    Public program revenue for the distribution formula includes revenue from medical assistance,
prepaid medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and prepaid general assistance medical
care. Training sites that receive no public program revenue are ineligible for funds available under
this subdivision. For purposes of determining training-site level grants to be distributed under
paragraph (a), total statewide average costs per trainee for medical residents is based on audited
clinical training costs per trainee in primary care clinical medical education programs for medical
residents. Total statewide average costs per trainee for dental residents is based on audited clinical
training costs per trainee in clinical medical education programs for dental students. Total statewide
average costs per trainee for pharmacy residents is based on audited clinical training costs per
trainee in clinical medical education programs for pharmacy students.
   (b) $5,350,000 of the available medical education funds shall be distributed as follows:
   (1) $1,475,000 to the University of Minnesota Medical Center-Fairview;
   (2) $2,075,000 to the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry; and
    (3) $1,800,000 to the Academic Health Center. $150,000 of the funds distributed to the Academic
Health Center under this paragraph shall be used for a program to assist foreign-trained physicians
to successfully compete for family medicine residency programs at the University of Minnesota.
    (c) Funds distributed shall not be used to displace current funding appropriations from federal
or state sources.
    (d) Funds shall be distributed to the sponsoring institutions indicating the amount to be
distributed to each of the sponsor's clinical medical education programs based on the criteria in
this subdivision and in accordance with the commissioner's approval letter. Each clinical medical
education program must distribute funds allocated under paragraph (a) to the training sites as
specified in the commissioner's approval letter. Sponsoring institutions, which are accredited

through an organization recognized by the Department of Education or the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, may contract directly with training sites to provide clinical training. To
ensure the quality of clinical training, those accredited sponsoring institutions must:
   (1) develop contracts specifying the terms, expectations, and outcomes of the clinical training
conducted at sites; and
   (2) take necessary action if the contract requirements are not met. Action may include the
withholding of payments under this section or the removal of students from the site.
    (e) Any funds not distributed in accordance with the commissioner's approval letter must be
returned to the medical education and research fund within 30 days of receiving notice from the
commissioner. The commissioner shall distribute returned funds to the appropriate training sites in
accordance with the commissioner's approval letter.

    Section 1. [62Q.545] COVERAGE OF PRIVATE DUTY NURSING SERVICES.
    (a) Private duty nursing services, as provided under section 256B.0625, subdivision 7, with the
exception of section 256B.0654, subdivision 4, shall be covered under a health plan for persons who
are concurrently covered by both the health plan and enrolled in medical assistance under chapter
256B.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a period of private duty nursing services may be subject to the
co-payment, coinsurance, deductible, or other enrollee cost-sharing requirements that apply under
the health plan. Cost-sharing requirements for private duty nursing services must not place a greater
financial burden on the insured or enrollee than those requirements applied by the health plan to other
similar services or benefits. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a health plan company from
requiring prior authorization by the health plan company for such services as required by section
256B.0625, subdivision 7, or use of contracted providers under the applicable provisions of the
health plan.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to health plans offered,
sold, issued, or renewed on or after that date.

practices for promoting successful reconciliation between married persons who are considering or
have commenced a marriage dissolution proceeding and who choose to pursue reconciliation.
    Subd. 3. Implementation. The regents shall:
    (1) enter into contracts or manage a grant process for implementation of the project; and

96TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 4, 2010                                      10265

   (2) pass an examination to demonstrate competency under the dental therapy scope of practice;
   (3) be licensed as a dental therapist;
   (4) complete 2,000 hours of dental therapy clinical practice under direct or indirect supervision;
   (5) graduate from a master's advanced dental therapy education program;
   (6) pass a board-approved certification examination to demonstrate competency under the
advanced scope of practice; and
   (7) submit an application for certification as prescribed by the board.
     (b) A dental therapy educational program may offer a combined dental therapy and advanced
dental therapy program if the combined program was in existence on April 1, 2010. The combined
program is exempt from board approval if the requirement of section 150A.06, subdivision 1d,
paragraph (b) is met. A graduate of a combined program satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a),
clauses (1) and (5), if the degree upon graduation is a master's degree and the board shall issue a
dental therapy license and an advanced practice certification to a graduate of a combined program
if the other licensure and certification requirements are satisfied. As part of the combined program,
the clinical practice requirements in paragraph (a), clause (4), may be commenced before a dental
therapy license is granted.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 150A.06, subdivision 1d, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 1d. Dental therapists. (a) A person of good moral character who has graduated with
a baccalaureate degree or a master's degree from a dental therapy education program that has
been approved by the board or accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on
Dental Accreditation or another board-approved national accreditation organization may apply for
licensure.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a dental therapy education program in existence on April 1,
2010, is exempt from the requirement of board approval and applicants who have graduated from
the program shall be licensed if the requirements of paragraph (c) are satisfied. Programs identified
in this paragraph must become accredited within two years after the establishment of a recognized
national accreditation program for dental therapists.
    (c) The applicant must submit an application and fee as prescribed by the board and a diploma
or certificate from a dental therapy education program. Prior to being licensed, the applicant must
pass a comprehensive, competency-based clinical examination that is approved by the board and
administered independently of an institution providing dental therapy education. The applicant must
also pass an examination testing the applicant's knowledge of the Minnesota laws and rules relating
to the practice of dentistry. An applicant who has failed the clinical examination twice is ineligible
to retake the clinical examination until further education and training are obtained as specified
by the board. A separate, nonrefundable fee may be charged for each time a person applies. An
applicant who passes the examination in compliance with subdivision 2b, abides by professional
ethical conduct requirements, and meets all the other requirements of the board shall be licensed as
a dental therapist.

    Subd. 9. Immunity from liability; no requirement to obtain information. (a) A pharmacist,
prescriber, or other dispenser making a report to the program in good faith under this section is

and filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics
the reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period
of six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of the
county in which the application is made may authorize the license to be issued at any time before
expiration of the five-day period required under paragraph (a). A waiver of the five-day waiting
period must be in the following form:

    COURT ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION:
    STATE OF MINNESOTA, COUNTY OF .................... (insert county name)
    After reviewing the above application, I am satisfied that an emergency or extraordinary
circumstance exists that justifies the issuance of the marriage license before the expiration of
five days from the date of the application. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the local registrar is
authorized and directed to issue the license forthwith.
    .....................................................
    ................................ (judge of district court)
    ................................ (date).
    (c) The marriage license fee for parties who have completed at least 12 hours of premarital
education is $40. In order to qualify for the reduced license fee, the parties must submit at the time
of applying for the marriage license a signed, dated, and notarized statement from the person who
provided the premarital education on their letterhead confirming that it was received. The premarital
education must be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's designee, a person
authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized to practice marriage
and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use of a premarital
inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)
received at least 12 hours of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory
and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request.

commissioner shall develop procedures
to maximize reimbursement of these
expenditures over the TANF emergency fund
base year quarters. Growth in expenditures
for the diversionary work program over the
amount expended in the calendar quarters in
the TANF emergency fund base year shall be
used to leverage these funds.
(b) To the extent that the commissioner

leverage the increased expenditures in
paragraph (a).
(c) TANF emergency funds for nonrecurrent
short-term benefits received in excess of the
amounts necessary for paragraphs (a) and (b)
