      Sec. 3. [17.4989] FISH SAMPLE COLLECTING.
    Subdivision 1. Training. Fish collector training may be offered by any organization or agency
that has had its class and practicum syllabus approved by the commissioner. The class and practicum
must include the following components:
   (1) accurate identification of licensed water bodies listed according to section 17.4984 and
ensuring that collection is taking place at the correct site;
      (2) identification of fish internal organs;
   (3) fish dissection and sample preparation as identified by the Department of Natural Resources
based on specific testing requirements or as outlined in the Fish Health Blue Book or the Diagnostic
Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases, published by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE);
      (4) recording and reporting data;
      (5) sample preparation and shipping;
    (6) a field collection site test to demonstrate mastery of the necessary skills, overseen by a
certified fish health inspector; and
   (7) a certificate of successful completion signed by a certified fish health inspector on a form
provided by the commissioner.
    Subd. 2. Certification time period. Fish collector certification is valid for five years and is
not transferable. A person may renew certification only by successfully completing certification
training. Certification shall be revoked if the certified person is convicted of violating any of the
statutes or rules governing testing for aquatic species diseases. Certification may be suspended

    (b) An aquatic farm propagating any species on the viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS)
susceptible list and having an effluent discharge from the aquatic farm into public waters must
test for VHS virus using the guidelines of the Fish Health Blue Book or the Diagnostic Manual
for Aquatic Animal Diseases, published by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The
commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, prescribe alternative testing
time periods and methods from those prescribed in the Fish Health Blue Book or the OIE Diagnostic
Manual if the commissioner determines that biosecurity measures will not be compromised. These
alternatives are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does
not apply. The commissioner must provide reasonable notice to affected parties of any changes in
testing requirements.
    (c) Results of fish health inspections must be provided to the commissioner for all fish that remain
in the state. All data used to prepare and issue a fish health certificate must be maintained for three
years by the issuing fish health inspector, approved laboratory, or accredited veterinarian.
    (d) A health inspection fee must be charged based on each lot of fish sampled. The fee by check
or money order payable to the Department of Natural Resources must be prepaid or paid at the time
a bill or notice is received from the commissioner that the inspection and processing of samples is
completed.

a containment facility, unless the fish are being transported directly to an outlet for processing or
other food purposes or unless the commissioner determines that an inspection is not needed. A fish
health inspection conducted for this purpose need only be done on the lot or lots of fish that will
be transported. The commissioner must conduct a fish health inspection requested for this purpose
within five working days of receiving written notice. Salmonids and catfish may be immediately
transported from a containment facility to another containment facility once a sample has been

a sucker egg license endorsement may take based on the number of sucker eggs taken historically
by the licensee, new requests for eggs, and the condition of the spawning runs at those historical
streams and rivers that have produced previous annual quotas.

paragraphs (d) and (f), every person owning or controlling any domestic animal that has died or
been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption, shall as soon
as reasonably possible bury the carcass at a depth adequate to prevent scavenging by other animals
in the ground or thoroughly burn it or dispose of it by another method approved by the board as
being effective for the protection of public health and the control of livestock diseases. The board,
through its executive director, may issue permits to owners of rendering plants located in Minnesota
which are operated and conducted as required by law, to transport carcasses of domestic animals and
fowl that have died, or have been killed otherwise than by being slaughtered for human or animal
consumption, over the public highways to their plants for rendering purposes in accordance with
the rules adopted by the board relative to transportation, rendering, and other provisions the board
considers necessary to prevent the spread of disease. The board may issue permits to owners of
rendering plants located in an adjacent state with which a reciprocal agreement is in effect under
subdivision 3.
     (b) Carcasses collected by rendering plants under permit may be used for pet food or mink food
if the owner or operator meets the requirements of subdivision 1b.
    (c) An authorized employee or agent of the board may enter private or public property and inspect
the carcass of any domestic animal that has died or has been killed other than by being slaughtered
for human or animal consumption. Failure to dispose of the carcass of any domestic animal within
the period specified by this subdivision is a public nuisance. The board may petition the district court
of the county in which a carcass is located for a writ requiring the abatement of the public nuisance.
A civil action commenced under this paragraph does not preclude a criminal prosecution under this
section. No person may sell, offer to sell, give away, or convey along a public road or on land the
person does not own, the carcass of a domestic animal when the animal died or was killed other
than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption unless it is done with a special permit
pursuant to this section. The carcass or parts of a domestic animal that has died or has been killed
other than by being slaughtered for human or animal consumption may be transported along a public
road for a medical or scientific purpose if the carcass is enclosed in a leakproof container to prevent
spillage or the dripping of liquid waste. The board may adopt rules relative to the transportation
of the carcass of any domestic animal for a medical or scientific purpose. A carcass on a public

thoroughfare may be transported for burial or other disposition in accordance with this section.
   No person who owns or controls diseased animals shall negligently or willfully permit them to
escape from that control or to run at large.
   (d) A sheep producer may compost sheep carcasses owned by the producer on the producer's
land without a permit and is exempt from compost facility specifications contained in rules of the
board.
   (e) The board shall develop best management practices for dead animal disposal and the
Pollution Control Agency feedlot program shall distribute them to livestock producers in the state.
    (f) Paragraph (a) does not apply to livestock killed by wild animals or domestic dogs and the
carcass is out-of-sight of the public, and will be used to attract the offending predators back to the
kill site.

may construct such plant, or purchase an existing plant by agreement with the owner, or where
it cannot agree with the owner on price, it may acquire an existing plant by condemnation, as

whole or in part, finance, refinance, pay the costs or expenses of, or otherwise fund the construction,
acquisition, or operation of a telephone exchange, directly or indirectly, through issuance of debt,
liability, or obligation, or secure or otherwise become contingently liable for the costs or expenses,
except through the use of the revenues directly earned or to be earned from the operation of the
telephone exchange. This subdivision does not preclude a municipality that has, on the effective date
of this act, already approved a sales tax from using the revenue derived from the tax for constructing,
acquiring, or operating a telephone exchange.
   (b) This subdivision does not prohibit:
    (1) the use of otherwise available funds to pay the reasonable costs of studying the feasibility
of operating a telephone exchange or conducting an election on a proposal for the operation of a
telephone exchange; or
    (2) the sale to nongovernmental investors of revenue bonds to fund the construction or
acquisition of a telephone exchange if principal, interest, and premium are payable upon maturity or
default and are actually paid solely from, and all obligations under the bonds are secured solely by,
the net revenues earned or to be earned by the ownership or operation of the telephone exchange.
    Subd. 3. Feasibility study. (a) Before conducting the referendum under subdivision 1, the
municipality must prepare and make publicly available a written report on the feasibility of owning
or acquiring, and operating a telephone exchange. The feasibility report must, at minimum, address
and disclose:
   (1) the cost of establishing, acquiring, or leasing the telephone exchange facilities and an
explanation of how these costs will be paid;
    (2) detailed projected income statements for each of the first five years of operation of the
telephone exchange. In addition to including revenue and expense detail, the projected income
statements must also include allowances for depreciation, and a maintenance and upgrade plan for
the telephone exchange to avoid technological obsolescence;
   (3) a five-year projected capital budget; and
    (4) the costs incurred by the municipality in preparing the feasibility report and a list of the
individuals or firms paid by the municipality for assistance in studying the feasibility of the project.
    (b) Not less than 60 days before the referendum, the municipality must hold a public hearing
regarding the feasibility report. Public notice of the hearing must be given to inform the public of
the availability of the feasibility report for inspection and copying.
    (c) The ballot issue for the referendum must include, in addition to any other information
required by law, a statement of the maximum costs disclosed under paragraph (a), clauses (1) and
(2), to construct, acquire, and operate the telephone exchange, which costs shall not be exceeded
without voter approval in another election.

municipally owned or controlled conduit, towers, telephone poles, and permitting fees charged
for access to the municipally owned and managed facilities. A municipality operating a telephone
exchange under this section shall:
    (1) approve or reject all permit applications seeking access to the facilities from a private
telecommunications service provider within 30 days of submission; and
   (2) deny a permit application only for cause and must provide a written explanation for any
denial.
    A permit not acted on within 30 days by a municipality operating a telephone exchange under
this section shall be considered approved.
    Subd. 5. Competitive bidding required. All agreements between a municipality and any firm
or individual related to a feasibility study, construction or acquisition, and operation of a telephone
exchange, is a "contract" as defined under section 471.345, subdivision 2.

     (b) The following organizations may authorize one or more charter schools:
    (1) a school board; intermediate school district school board; education district organized under
sections 123A.15 to 123A.19;
    (2) a charitable organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
excluding a nonpublic sectarian or religious institution, any person other than a natural person that
directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with the nonpublic sectarian or religious institution, and any other charitable
organization under this clause that in the federal IRS Form 1023, Part IV, describes activities
indicating a religious purpose, that:
   (i) is a member of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits or the Minnesota Council on
Foundations;
     (ii) is registered with the attorney general's office;
     (iii) reports an end-of-year fund balance of at least $2,000,000; and
     (iv) is incorporated in the state of Minnesota;
    (3) a Minnesota private college, notwithstanding clause (2), that grants two- or four-year degrees

State Colleges and Universities; or the University of Minnesota; or
   (4) a nonprofit corporation subject to chapter 317A, described in section 317A.905, and exempt
from federal income tax under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, may
authorize one or more charter schools if the charter school has operated for at least three years
under a different authorizer and if the nonprofit corporation has existed for at least 25 years.
    (5) no more than three single-purpose sponsors that are charitable, nonsectarian organizations
formed under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and incorporated in the state
of Minnesota whose sole purpose is to charter schools. Eligible organizations interested in being
approved as a sponsor under this paragraph must submit a proposal to the commissioner that includes
the provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan. Such authorizers shall consider and

approve applications using the criteria provided in subdivision 4 and shall not limit the applications
it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or method.
    (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval
as an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The
application for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to
implement the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The
commissioner must approve or disapprove an application within 60 business days of the application
deadline. If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the
applicant of the deficiencies and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. Failing to address the deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer. The commissioner, in establishing
criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
   (1) capacity and infrastructure;
   (2) application criteria and process;
   (3) contracting process;
   (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
   (5) renewal criteria and processes.
    (d) The affidavit to be submitted to and evaluated by the commissioner must include at least the
following:
   (1) how chartering schools is a way for the organization to carry out its mission;
    (2) a description of the capacity of the organization to serve as a sponsor, including the personnel
who will perform the sponsoring duties, their qualifications, the amount of time they will be assigned
to this responsibility, and the financial resources allocated by the organization to this responsibility;
   (3) a description of the application and review process the authorizer will use to make decisions
regarding the granting of charters, which will include at least the following:
   (i) how the statutory purposes defined in subdivision 1 are addressed;
   (ii) the mission, goals, program model, and student performance expectations;
   (iii) an evaluation plan for the school that includes criteria for evaluating educational,
organizational, and fiscal plans;
   (iv) the school's governance plan;
   (v) the financial management plan; and
   (vi) the administration and operations plan;
    (4) a description of the type of contract it will arrange with the schools it charters that meets
the provisions of subdivision 6 and defines the rights and responsibilities of the charter school for
governing its educational program, controlling its funds, and making school management decisions;
   (5) the process to be used for providing ongoing oversight of the school consistent with the
7350                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [71ST DAY

contract expectations specified in clause (4) that assures that the schools chartered are complying
with both the provisions of applicable law and rules, and with the contract;
   (6) the process for making decisions regarding the renewal or termination of the school's charter
based on evidence that demonstrates the academic, organizational, and financial competency of the
school, including its success in increasing student achievement and meeting the goals of the charter
school agreement; and
    (7) an assurance specifying that the organization is committed to serving as a sponsor for the
full five-year term.
   A disapproved applicant under this paragraph may resubmit an application during a future
application period.
   (e) The authorizer must participate in department-approved training.
    (f) An authorizer that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2011, to
the commissioner for approval, under paragraph (c), to continue as an authorizer under this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, an authorizer that fails to submit a timely application is ineligible
to charter a school.
    (g) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner
and form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more
frequently at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator,
charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action.
    (h) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; or
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer.

or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.
     (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate ­      a­

establish a board of directors composed of at least five members who are not related parties until
a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according
to the school's articles and bylaws under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must
be composed of at least five members who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the
school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents
or legal guardians of children enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members
of the school's board of directors. A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board
election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with
chapter 13D.
    (e) Upon the request of an individual, the charter school must make available in a timely fashion
the minutes of meetings of the board of directors, and of members and committees having any
board-delegated authority; financial statements showing all operations and transactions affecting
income, surplus, and deficit during the school's last annual accounting period; and a balance sheet
summarizing assets and liabilities on the closing date of the accounting period. A charter school also
must post on its official Web site information identifying its authorizer and indicate how to contact
that authorizer and include that same information about its authorizer in other school materials that
it makes available to the public.
   (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
7352                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [71ST DAY

governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one
licensed teacher employed at the school or a licensed teacher providing instruction under a contact
between the charter school and a cooperative; (ii) the parent or legal guardian of a student enrolled
in the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed by the charter
school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher majority
board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the chief
administrator are ex-officio nonvoting board members. Board bylaws shall outline the process and
procedures for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may
change its governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must show that:
   (1) the expansion proposed by the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
    (2) the charter school expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating
students' improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter
120B;
   (3) the charter school is fiscally sound and has the financial capacity to implement the proposed
expansion; and

   (4) the authorizer finds that the charter school has the management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental

partner is an owner, employee or agent of, or a contractor with a for-profit or nonprofit entity or an
individual with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional services,
goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable at the option of the

   (3) the partner of the board member, employee, officer, or agent; or
   (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3),
has a financial or other interest in the entity with which the charter school is contracting. A violation
of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
   (e) A charter school board member or employee must not receive any remuneration in
conjunction with a financial transaction involving the charter school.
    (f) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid

     Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating
a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed
action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and
that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the
authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract.
Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 15-business-day
period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written
request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to the charter school's board
of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal hearing before taking
final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract no later than 20
business days before the proposed date for terminating the contract or the end date of the contract.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
   (3) violations of law; or
   (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 3

    (c) If the sponsor and the charter school board of directors mutually agree to terminate or not
renew the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves the transfer
to a different eligible authorizer to authorize the charter school. Both parties must jointly submit
their intent in writing to the commissioner to mutually terminate the contract. The sponsor that is
a party to the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about
the fiscal and operational status and student performance of the school. Before the commissioner
determines whether to approve a transfer of authorizer, the commissioner first must determine
whether the charter school and prospective new authorizer can identify and effectively resolve
those circumstances causing the previous authorizer and the charter school to mutually agree to
terminate the contract. If no transfer of sponsor is approved, the school must be dissolved according
to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
    (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing, may
terminate the existing contract between the authorizer and the charter school board if the charter
school has a history of:
   (1) failure to meet pupil performance requirements contained in the contract;
  (2) financial mismanagement or failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal
management; or

circumstances of the charter school.
    (b) To retain eligibility for facilities lease transition aid, an eligible charter school must submit
the following information to the commissioner:
   (1) the owner of the building;
   (2) a list of the lessor's current board members or principals, whichever applies;
   (3) a copy of the lessor's annual audit or annual report, whichever applies;

deny the charter school's building lease transition aid.
    (d) A charter school must not use the building lease transition aid for custodial, maintenance
service, utility, or other operating costs. The amount of building lease transition aid per pupil unit
served for a charter school in any year shall not exceed the lesser of:

3, aid payments for the current fiscal year to a charter school shall be of an equal amount on each
of the 24 payment dates.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and section 127A.45, for a charter school ceasing operation
on or prior to June 30 of a school year, for the payment periods occurring after the school ceases
serving students, the commissioner shall withhold the estimated state aid owed the school. The
charter school board of directors and authorizer must submit to the commissioner a closure plan
under chapter 308A or 317A, and financial information about the school's liabilities and assets.
After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an audit of pupil counts, documentation
of lease expenditures, and monitoring of special education expenditures, the commissioner may
release cash withheld and may continue regular payments up to the current year payment percentages
if further amounts are owed. If, based on audits and monitoring, the school received state aid in
excess of the amount owed, the commissioner shall retain aid withheld sufficient to eliminate the
aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations prior to, or at the end of, a school year,
notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary final payments may be made after
receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of special education expenditures,
documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of Uniform Financial Accounting and
Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year of operation. Final payment may be
made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section 123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount
of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If, within the timeline under section 471.425, a charter school fails to pay the state of
Minnesota, a school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative after receiving an
undisputed invoice for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid
sufficient to satisfy the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative. An interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or education cooperative shall notify the commissioner
when a charter school fails to pay an undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it
received the original invoice.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.
    (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the

participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar
quarter to the department. The department must develop a Web-based reporting form for charter
schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in
the form and manner requested by the department.

    Subdivision 1. Issuance of bonds. (a) The Charter School Facilities Authority may issue revenue
bonds, in anticipation of the collection of facilities aid revenues under section 124D.11, subdivision
4a, from an endorsed charter school, to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition,
acquisition and renovation, or construction of a charter school building. It may enter into a loan
agreement with an endorsed charter school so that payments required to be made by the endorsed
charter school are fixed and revised as necessary to produce income and revenue sufficient to provide
for the prompt payment of principal and interest on all bonds issued when due. The loan agreement
must also provide that the endorsed charter school is required to pay all expenses of the operation
and maintenance of the charter school building, including adequate insurance and insurance against
all liability for injury to persons or property arising from its operation, and all taxes and special
assessments levied upon or with respect to the charter school building and payable during the term
of the loan agreement.
    (b) The Charter School Facilities Authority by resolution may exercise the powers of a
municipality under sections 469.152 to 469.165, without an election, for the purposes of financing
charter school buildings, including the issuance of bonds and the application of the bond proceeds
and investment income pursuant to a loan or other agreement. The bonds must be issued, sold, and
secured on the terms and conditions and in the manner determined by resolution of the authority.
The bonds must be sold at a public sale at not less than par. Bonds issued by the Charter School
Facilities Authority to finance a school facility and bonds issued to refund bonds issued by the
Charter School Facilities Authority to finance a school facility must mature within 30 years from
the date of issue of the first bonds issued to finance the school facility.
    (c) Bonds issued under this section are not general obligations of the state or the authority. The

for the payment of the bonds. No person may compel the levy of a tax for the payment or compel
the appropriation of money of the state or the authority for the payment of the bonds, except as
specifically provided in section 124D.1109.
    Subd. 2. Income tax exemption. In the issuance of bonds by the authority, the authority must

bonds or the provisions made for the security of those bonds is not affected.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2011 and later.

due, it must notify the commissioner of education as soon as possible, but not less than 15 business
days before the date that principal or interest payment is due. The notice must include the name

the payment is due, the amount of principal and interest due on the payment date, the amount of
principal or interest that the endorsed charter school will be unable to repay on that date, the trustee
or paying agent for the debt obligation, the wire transfer instructions to transfer funds to that trustee
or paying agent, and an indication as to whether a payment is being requested by the endorsed
charter school under this section. If a trustee or paying agent becomes aware of a potential default,
it shall inform the commissioner of education of that fact. After receipt of a notice that requests a
payment under this section, after consultation with the endorsed charter school and the trustee or
paying agent, and after verification of the accuracy of the information provided, the commissioner
of education shall notify the commissioner of management and budget of the potential default. The
notice must include a statement of the amount due that the endorsed charter school will be unable
to repay on the date due.
   (b) Except as provided in subdivision 6, upon receipt of this notice from the commissioner of
education, the commissioner of management and budget shall issue a warrant and authorize the
commissioner of education to pay to the trustee or paying agent for the debt obligation the specified
amount on or before the date due. The amounts needed for the purposes of this subdivision are
annually appropriated to the Department of Education from the charter school credit enhancement
account in the special revenue fund in the state treasury.
    (c) The commissioners of education and management and budget must jointly develop detailed
procedures for endorsed charter schools to notify the state that they have obligated themselves to
be bound by the provisions of this section, procedures for endorsed charter schools and trustees and
paying agents to notify the state of potential defaults and to request state payment under this section,
and procedures for the state to expedite payments to prevent defaults. The procedures are not subject
to chapter 14.
    Subd. 3. Endorsed charter school bound; interest rate on state-paid amount. If, at the request
of an endorsed charter school, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on an
endorsed charter school's debt obligation on a specific date, the endorsed charter school is bound by
all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the date paid until
the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner of management
and budget. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding, less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4, and other payments received from the endorsed charter school.
     Subd. 4. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the state must
reduce the state aid payable to the endorsed charter school under section 124D.11 by the amount
paid by the state under this section on behalf of the endorsed charter school, plus the interest due on
it, and the amount reduced must revert from the appropriate account to the charter school facilities
credit enhancement account. No federal aid payments shall be reduced.
    (b) If, after review of the financial situation of the endorsed charter school, the commissioner
of education advises the commissioner of management and budget that a total reduction of aids
would cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the
endorsed charter school, the commissioner of education, with the approval of the commissioner of
management and budget, may establish a different schedule for reduction of aids to repay the state.
The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any amounts repaid to the state by the endorsed
charter school from other revenue sources.
   Subd. 5. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the state makes payments on behalf of an
7368                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [71ST DAY

endorsed charter school under this section or the endorsed charter school defaults in the payment of
principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to the commissioner
of education for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to resolve the issues that
led to its inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The commissioners must
provide technical assistance to the endorsed charter school in preparing its plan. If the commissioner
of education determines that an endorsed charter school's plan is not adequate, the commissioner
shall notify the endorsed charter school that the plan has been disapproved, the reasons for the
disapproval, and that the state shall not make future payments under this section for debt obligations
issued after the date specified in that notice until its plan is approved. The commissioner of education
may also notify the endorsed charter school that until its plan is approved, other aids due to the
endorsed charter school will be withheld after a date specified in the notice.
    Subd. 6. State bond rating. If the commissioner of management and budget determines that
issuing warrants under subdivision 2 would adversely affect the credit rating of the state, the
commissioner shall not issue warrants for the payment of principal or interest on debt obligations
under this section.
    Subd. 7. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of management and budget
may enter into written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information
with respect to bonds issued to finance the school facilities of endorsed charter schools according
to federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, including Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and regulations, section 240.15c2-12. The agreements or contracts may be in any form the
commissioner of management and budget deems reasonable and in the state's best interests.
