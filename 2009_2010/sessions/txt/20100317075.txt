                                   REPORTS OF COMMITTEES

   Senator Pogemiller moved that the Committee Reports at the Desk be now adopted, with the
exception of the report pertaining to appointments. The motion prevailed.

      Senator Moua from the Committee on Judiciary, to which was referred
   S.F. No. 2789: A bill for an act relating to juvenile records; modifying provisions governing
public access to certain juvenile records; limiting release of records with informed consent;
amending Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.171, subdivision 5.
      Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
      Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
      "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 241.31, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishment of program. Notwithstanding any provisions of Minnesota
Statutes to the contrary, any city, county or town, or any nonprofit corporation approved by the
commissioner of corrections, or any combination thereof may establish and operate a community
corrections program for the purpose of providing housing, supervision, treatment, counseling or
other correctional services;
   (a) to persons convicted of crime in the courts of this state and placed on probation by such
courts pursuant to section 609.135;
   (b) to persons not yet convicted of a crime but under criminal accusation who voluntarily accept
such treatment;
   (c) to persons adjudicated a delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency
under chapter 260 or chapter 260B;
      (d) with the approval of the commissioner of corrections, to persons paroled under chapter 242;
and
    (e) with the approval of the commissioner of corrections, to persons paroled under section 243.05
or released under section 241.26.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 242.32, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Secure placement of juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall license several small
regional facilities providing secure capacity programming for juveniles who have been adjudicated
delinquent, have received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, or have been convicted as extended
jurisdiction juveniles and require secure placement. The programming shall be tailored to the types
of juveniles being served, including their offense history, age, gender, cultural and ethnic heritage,
mental health and chemical dependency problems, and other characteristics. Services offered shall
include but not be limited to:
      (1) intensive general educational programs, with an individual educational plan for each juvenile;
    (2) specific educational components in the management of anger and nonviolent conflict
resolution;
7786                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

   (3) treatment for chemical dependency;
   (4) mental health screening, assessment, and treatment; and
   (5) programming to educate offenders about sexuality and address issues specific to victims and
perpetrators of sexual abuse.
   The facilities shall collaborate with facilities providing nonsecure residential programming and
with community-based aftercare programs.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245C.24, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Permanent bar to set aside a disqualification. (a) Except as otherwise provided
in ­
   p­a­
      r­
       a­
        g­r­

            ph­­­
                (b
                 ­­) this subdivision, the commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of any
individual disqualified pursuant to this chapter, regardless of how much time has passed, if the
individual was disqualified for a crime or conduct listed in section 245C.15, subdivision 1.
    (b) For an individual in the chemical dependency or corrections field who was disqualified for
a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, and whose disqualification was
set aside prior to July 1, 2005, the commissioner must consider granting a variance pursuant to
section 245C.30 for the license holder for a program dealing primarily with adults. A request for
reconsideration evaluated under this paragraph must include a letter of recommendation from the
license holder that was subject to the prior set-aside decision addressing the individual's quality of
care to children or vulnerable adults and the circumstances of the individual's departure from that
service.
    (c) When a licensed foster care provider adopts an individual who had received foster care
services from the provider for over six months, and the adopted individual is required to receive
a background study under section 245C.03, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2) or (6), the
commissioner may grant a variance to the license holder under section 245C.30 to permit the adopted
individual with a permanent disqualification to remain affiliated with the license holder under the
conditions of the variance when the variance is recommended by the county of responsibility for
each of the remaining individuals in placement in the home and the licensing agency for the home.
    (d) The commissioner shall consider granting a set aside under section 245C.22 or a variance
under section 245C.30 to an individual who is now 21 years of age or older and who was disqualified
for a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, occurring while the individual
was under the age of 18. This paragraph does not apply to individuals who were convicted of the
disqualifying crime following certification under section 260B.125.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.125, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Public safety. In determining whether the public safety is served by certifying the
matter, the court shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including the
existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines, the use of a firearm,
and the impact on any victim;
   (2) the culpability of the child in committing the alleged offense, including the level of the child's

participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any mitigating factors
recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines;
    (3) the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency;
   (4) the child's programming history, including the child's past willingness to participate
meaningfully in available programming;
   (5) the adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system; and
   (6) the dispositional options available for the child.
In considering these factors, the court shall give greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged
offense and the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency, than to the other factors
listed in this subdivision.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.130, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Execution of adult sentence. (a) When it appears that a person convicted as an
extended jurisdiction juvenile has violated the conditions of the stayed sentence, or is alleged to
have committed a new offense, the court may, without notice, revoke the stay and probation and
direct that the offender be taken into immediate custody. The court shall notify the offender in
writing of the reasons alleged to exist for revocation of the stay of execution of the adult sentence.
If the offender challenges the reasons, the court shall hold a summary hearing on the issue at which
the offender is entitled to be heard and represented by counsel.
    (b) If a person described in paragraph (a) is taken into custody, the person may be detained
in a secure juvenile detention facility. If there is no secure juvenile detention facility or existing
acceptable detention alternative available for juveniles within the county, the child may be detained
up to 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or for up to six hours in a standard
metropolitan statistical area, in a jail, lockup, or other facility used for the confinement of adults
who have been charged with or convicted of a crime. In this instance, the person must be confined
in quarters separate from any adult confined in the facility that allow for complete sight and sound
separation for all activities during the period of the detention, and the adult facility must be approved
for the detention of juveniles by the commissioner of corrections.
   If the person is 18 years of age or older and is to be detained prior to the revocation hearing, the
person may be detained in a local adult correctional facility without the need for sight and sound
separation.
    (c) After the hearing, if the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay of execution of
sentence, the court shall treat the offender as an adult and order any of the adult sanctions authorized
by section 609.14, subdivision 3, except that no credit shall be given for time served in juvenile
facility custody prior to a summary hearing. If the offender was convicted of an offense described in
subdivision 1, clause (2), and the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay, the court must order
execution of the previously imposed sentence unless the court makes written findings regarding the
mitigating factors that justify continuing the stay.
   (d) Upon revocation, the offender's extended jurisdiction status is terminated and juvenile court
7788                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [75TH DAY

jurisdiction is terminated. The ongoing jurisdiction for any adult sanction, other than commitment
to the commissioner of corrections, is with the adult court.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to be
delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600
to 9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse
the court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall order a children's mental health screening and a chemical use screening
conducted when a child is found to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a
screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by
a mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer
who is trained in the use of the screening instrument. If the screening indicates a need for a mental
health assessment, the local social services agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall
have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section
245.4871. If the screening indicates a need for a chemical use assessment, the local social service
agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall have a chemical use assessment conducted, as
defined in section 254A.03, subdivision 3.
    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, in order that
the condition of the minor be given due consideration in the disposition of the case. Any funds
received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not cancel until the end of the fiscal year
immediately following the fiscal year in which the funds were received. The funds are available for
use by the commissioner of corrections during that period and are hereby appropriated annually to
the commissioner of corrections as reimbursement of the costs of providing these services to the
juvenile courts.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260B.425, hearings on any
matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner, except that a child who is
prosecuted as an extended jurisdiction juvenile has the right to a jury trial on the issue of guilt. The
rules of evidence promulgated pursuant to section 480.0591 and the law of evidence shall apply

in adjudicatory proceedings involving a child alleged to be delinquent, an extended jurisdiction
juvenile, or a juvenile petty offender, and hearings conducted pursuant to section 260B.125 except
to the extent that the rules themselves provide that they do not apply.
    (b) When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding, the court may make any
interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance with the provisions of
sections 260B.001 to 260B.421.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the court shall exclude the general public
from hearings under this chapter and shall admit only those persons who, in the discretion of the
court, have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court. The court shall permit the victim
of a child's delinquent act to attend any related delinquency proceeding, except that the court may
exclude the victim:
   (1) as a witness under the Rules of Criminal Procedure; and
    (2) from portions of a certification hearing to discuss psychological material or other evidence
that would not be accessible to the public.

    (c) The victim of any alleged delinquent act may, upon the victim's request, obtain the following
information, unless it reasonably appears that the request is prompted by a desire on the part of the
requester to engage in unlawful activities:
   (1) the name and age of the juvenile;
   (2) the act for which the juvenile was petitioned and date of the offense; and
7790                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [75TH DAY

   (3) the disposition, including, but not limited to, dismissal of the petition, diversion, probation
and conditions of probation, detention, fines, or restitution.
    (d) The records of juvenile probation officers and county home schools are records of the
court for the purposes of this subdivision. Court services data relating to delinquent acts that
are contained in records of the juvenile court may be released as allowed under section 13.84,
subdivision 6. This subdivision applies to all proceedings under this chapter, including appeals
from orders of the juvenile court, except that this subdivision does not apply to proceedings under
section 260B.335 or 260B.425 when the proceeding involves an adult defendant. The court shall
maintain the confidentiality of adoption files and records in accordance with the provisions of laws
relating to adoptions. In juvenile court proceedings any report or social history furnished to the
court shall be open to inspection by the attorneys of record and the guardian ad litem a reasonable
time before it is used in connection with any proceeding before the court.
    (e) When a judge of a juvenile court, or duly authorized agent of the court, determines under a
proceeding under this chapter that a child has violated a state or local law, ordinance, or regulation
pertaining to the operation of a motor vehicle on streets and highways, except parking violations,
the judge or agent shall immediately report the violation to the commissioner of public safety. The
report must be made on a form provided by the Department of Public Safety and must contain the
information required under section 169.95.
    (f) A county attorney may give a law enforcement agency that referred a delinquency matter to
the county attorney a summary of the results of that referral, including the details of any juvenile
court disposition.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.171, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Peace officer records of children. (a) Except for records relating to an offense where
the court opens the proceedings ­  a­
                                    r­
                                     e to the public under section 260B.163, subdivision 1, Peace
officers' records of children who are or may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts
shall be kept separate from records of persons 18 years of age or older and are private data but
shall be disseminated: (1) by order of the juvenile court, (2) as required by section 121A.28, (3) as
authorized under section 13.82, subdivision 2, (4) to the child or the child's parent or guardian unless
disclosure of a record would interfere with an ongoing investigation, (5) to the Minnesota crime
victims reparations board as required by section 611A.56, subdivision 2, clause (6), for the purpose
of processing claims for crime victims reparations, or (6) as otherwise provided in this subdivision.
Except as provided in paragraph (c), no photographs of a child taken into custody may be taken
without the consent of the juvenile court unless the child is alleged to have violated section 169A.20.
Peace officers' records containing data about children who are victims of crimes or witnesses to
crimes must be administered consistent with section 13.82, subdivisions 2, 3, 6, and 17. Any person
violating any of the provisions of this subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
    In the case of computerized records maintained about juveniles by peace officers, the
requirement of this subdivision that records about juveniles must be kept separate from adult
records does not mean that a law enforcement agency must keep its records concerning juveniles
on a separate computer system. Law enforcement agencies may keep juvenile records on the same
computer as adult records and may use a common index to access both juvenile and adult records
so long as the agency has in place procedures that keep juvenile records in a separate place in
computer storage and that comply with the special data retention and other requirements associated

with protecting data on juveniles.
   (b) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the exchange of information by law enforcement
agencies if the exchanged information is pertinent and necessary for law enforcement purposes.
    (c) A photograph may be taken of a child taken into custody pursuant to section 260B.175,
subdivision 1, clause (b), provided that the photograph must be destroyed when the child reaches
the age of 19 years. The commissioner of corrections may photograph juveniles whose legal
custody is transferred to the commissioner. Photographs of juveniles authorized by this paragraph
may be used only for institution management purposes, case supervision by parole agents, and to
assist law enforcement agencies to apprehend juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall maintain
photographs of juveniles in the same manner as juvenile court records and names under this section.
    (d) Traffic investigation reports are open to inspection by a person who has sustained physical
harm or economic loss as a result of the traffic accident. Identifying information on juveniles who
are parties to traffic accidents may be disclosed as authorized under section 13.82, subdivision 6, and
accident reports required under section 169.09 may be released under section 169.09, subdivision
13, unless the information would identify a juvenile who was taken into custody or who is suspected
of committing an offense that would be a crime if committed by an adult, or would associate a
juvenile with the offense, and the offense is not an adult court traffic offense under section 260B.225.
    (e) The head of a law enforcement agency or a person specifically given the duty by the head
of the law enforcement agency shall notify the superintendent or chief administrative officer of a
juvenile's school of an incident occurring within the agency's jurisdiction if:
    (1) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense that
would be a crime if committed as an adult, that the victim of the offense is a student or staff member
of the school, and that notice to the school is reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim;
or
    (2) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense described
in subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3), that would be a crime if committed by an adult,
regardless of whether the victim is a student or staff member of the school.
    A law enforcement agency is not required to notify the school under this paragraph if the agency
determines that notice would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. For purposes of this paragraph,
"school" means a public or private elementary, middle, secondary, or charter school.
   (f) In any county in which the county attorney operates or authorizes the operation of a juvenile
prepetition or pretrial diversion program, a law enforcement agency or county attorney's office may
provide the juvenile diversion program with data concerning a juvenile who is a participant in or is
being considered for participation in the program.
   (g) Upon request of a local social services agency, peace officer records of children who are or
may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts may be disseminated to the agency to
promote the best interests of the subject of the data.
    (h) Upon written request, the prosecuting authority shall release investigative data collected by
a law enforcement agency to the victim of a criminal act or alleged criminal act or to the victim's
legal representative, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph. Data shall not be released if:
7792                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

   (1) the release to the individual subject of the data would be prohibited under section 13.821; or
   (2) the prosecuting authority reasonably believes:
   (i) that the release of that data will interfere with the investigation; or
    (ii) that the request is prompted by a desire on the part of the requester to engage in unlawful
activities.
    (i) A consent to the release of a peace officer record governed by this subdivision from the
individual who is the subject of the record is not effective and a law enforcement agency must not
release the record or release information in a manner that reveals the existence of the record.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.176, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Reasons for detention. (a) If the child is not released as provided in subdivision 1, the
person taking the child into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the
child and the reasons for detention.
    (b) No child may be detained in a juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility longer
than 36 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after being taken into custody for a
delinquent act as defined in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless a petition has been filed and the
judge or referee determines pursuant to section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in detention.
    (c) No child may be detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a
standard metropolitan statistical area, after being taken into custody for a delinquent act as defined
in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless:
   (1) a petition has been filed under section 260B.141; and
    (2) a judge or referee has determined under section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in
detention.
    After August 1, 1991, no child described in this paragraph may be detained in an adult jail or
municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than
six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a standard metropolitan statistical area, unless the
requirements of this paragraph have been met and, in addition, a motion to refer the child for adult
prosecution has been made under section 260B.125. Notwithstanding this paragraph, continued
detention of a child in an adult detention facility outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area
county is permissible if:
    (i) the facility in which the child is detained is located where conditions of distance to be traveled
or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours. A delay not to
exceed 48 hours may be made under this clause; or
    (ii) the facility is located where conditions of safety exist. Time for an appearance may be delayed
until 24 hours after the time that conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. "Conditions of safety"
include adverse life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel.
    The continued detention of a child under clause (i) or (ii) must be reported to the commissioner
of corrections.
75TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010                                          7793

    (d) If a child described in paragraph (c) is to be detained in a jail beyond 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the judge or referee, in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the commissioner of corrections, shall notify the commissioner of the place of
the detention and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall thereupon assist the court in the
relocation of the child in an appropriate juvenile secure detention facility or approved jail within
the county or elsewhere in the state, or in determining suitable alternatives. The commissioner
shall direct that a child detained in a jail be detained after eight days from and including the date of
the original detention order in an approved juvenile secure detention facility with the approval of
the administrative authority of the facility. If the court refers the matter to the prosecuting authority
pursuant to section 260B.125, notice to the commissioner shall not be required.
     (e) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a children's
mental health screening conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of
human services, unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child
is currently under the care of a mental health professional. The screening shall be conducted by a
mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who
is trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention. The
results of the screening may only be presented to the court at the dispositional phase of the court
proceedings on the matter unless the parent or legal guardian consents to presentation at a different
time. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency or probation
officer, with the approval of the child's parent or legal guardian, shall have a diagnostic assessment
conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    (f) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a chemical
use screen conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services,
unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child is currently under
the care of a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. The screening shall be conducted by a mental
health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is
trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.198, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Continuance. When it is in the best interests of the child and public safety to do
so and when the child has admitted the allegations contained in the petition before the judge or
referee, or when a hearing has been held as provided for in section 260B.163 and the allegations
contained in the petition have been duly proven but, in either case, before a finding of delinquency
has been entered, the court may stay the adjudication of delinquency and continue the case for
a period not to exceed ­ 90­ 180 days on any one order. With the consent of the prosecutor, such
a continuance may be ­  ex­­e

any one order for the purpose of completing any consideration, or any investigation or examination
ordered in accordance with the provisions of section 260B.157. The court shall not stay adjudication
on any felony offense if the child has previously received a stay of adjudication of delinquency by
a court in any judicial district. This subdivision does not apply to an extended jurisdiction juvenile
proceeding. In calculating an adult criminal history score, a stay of adjudication for a felony-level
offense ordered by the court pursuant to this subdivision shall be counted as an adjudication by the
Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission.

sealing the record.
   (d) If the court issues an expungement order it may require that the criminal or delinquency

it is a gross misdemeanor offense to violate this prohibition; and (3) if the defendant violates this
condition of participation in the diversion program, the charge of committing a crime of violence

conditions of the variance when the variance is recommended by the county of responsibility for
each of the remaining individuals in placement in the home and the licensing agency for the home.
    (d) The commissioner shall consider granting a set aside under section 245C.22 or a variance
under section 245C.30 to an individual who is now 21 years of age or older and who was disqualified
for a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, occurring while the individual
was under the age of 18. This paragraph does not apply to individuals who were convicted of the
disqualifying crime following certification under section 260B.125.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.125, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Public safety. In determining whether the public safety is served by certifying the
matter, the court shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including the
existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines, the use of a firearm,
and the impact on any victim;
    (2) the culpability of the child in committing the alleged offense, including the level of the child's
participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any mitigating factors
recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines;
    (3) the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency;
   (4) the child's programming history, including the child's past willingness to participate
meaningfully in available programming;
   (5) the adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system; and
   (6) the dispositional options available for the child.
In considering these factors, the court shall give greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged
offense and the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency, than to the other factors
listed in this subdivision.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.130, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Execution of adult sentence. (a) When it appears that a person convicted as an
extended jurisdiction juvenile has violated the conditions of the stayed sentence, or is alleged to
have committed a new offense, the court may, without notice, revoke the stay and probation and
direct that the offender be taken into immediate custody. The court shall notify the offender in
writing of the reasons alleged to exist for revocation of the stay of execution of the adult sentence.
If the offender challenges the reasons, the court shall hold a summary hearing on the issue at which
the offender is entitled to be heard and represented by counsel.
    (b) If a person described in paragraph (a) is taken into custody, the person may be detained
in a secure juvenile detention facility. If there is no secure juvenile detention facility or existing
acceptable detention alternative available for juveniles within the county, the child may be detained
up to 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or for up to six hours in a standard
metropolitan statistical area, in a jail, lockup, or other facility used for the confinement of adults
75TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010                                          7805

who have been charged with or convicted of a crime. In this instance, the person must be confined
in quarters separate from any adult confined in the facility that allow for complete sight and sound
separation for all activities during the period of the detention, and the adult facility must be approved
for the detention of juveniles by the commissioner of corrections.
   If the person is 18 years of age or older and is to be detained prior to the revocation hearing, the
person may be detained in a local adult correctional facility without the need for sight and sound
separation.
    (c) After the hearing, if the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay of execution of
sentence, the court shall treat the offender as an adult and order any of the adult sanctions authorized
by section 609.14, subdivision 3, except that no credit shall be given for time served in juvenile
facility custody prior to a summary hearing. If the offender was convicted of an offense described in
subdivision 1, clause (2), and the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay, the court must order
execution of the previously imposed sentence unless the court makes written findings regarding the
mitigating factors that justify continuing the stay.
    (d) Upon revocation, the offender's extended jurisdiction status is terminated and juvenile court
jurisdiction is terminated. The ongoing jurisdiction for any adult sanction, other than commitment
to the commissioner of corrections, is with the adult court.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to be
delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600
to 9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse
the court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall order a children's mental health screening and a chemical use screening
conducted when a child is found to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a
screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by
a mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer
who is trained in the use of the screening instrument. If the screening indicates a need for a mental
health assessment, the local social services agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall
have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section
245.4871. If the screening indicates a need for a chemical use assessment, the local social service
agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall have a chemical use assessment conducted, as
defined in section 254A.03, subdivision 3.
7806                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [75TH DAY

    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, in order that
the condition of the minor be given due consideration in the disposition of the case. Any funds
received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not cancel until the end of the fiscal year
immediately following the fiscal year in which the funds were received. The funds are available for
use by the commissioner of corrections during that period and are hereby appropriated annually to
the commissioner of corrections as reimbursement of the costs of providing these services to the
juvenile courts.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260B.425, hearings on any
matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner, except that a child who is
prosecuted as an extended jurisdiction juvenile has the right to a jury trial on the issue of guilt. The
rules of evidence promulgated pursuant to section 480.0591 and the law of evidence shall apply
in adjudicatory proceedings involving a child alleged to be delinquent, an extended jurisdiction
juvenile, or a juvenile petty offender, and hearings conducted pursuant to section 260B.125 except
to the extent that the rules themselves provide that they do not apply.
    (b) When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding, the court may make any
interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance with the provisions of
sections 260B.001 to 260B.421.
    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the court shall exclude the general public
from hearings under this chapter and shall admit only those persons who, in the discretion of the
court, have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court. The court shall permit the victim
of a child's delinquent act to attend any related delinquency proceeding, except that the court may
exclude the victim:
   (1) as a witness under the Rules of Criminal Procedure; and
    (2) from portions of a certification hearing to discuss psychological material or other evidence
that would not be accessible to the public.

by an adult and the child was at least 16 years of age at the time of the offense, except that the court
may exclude the public from portions of a certification hearing to discuss psychological material or
other evidence that would not be accessible to the public in an adult proceeding.
    (d) In all delinquency cases a person named in the charging clause of the petition as a person
directly damaged in person or property shall be entitled, upon request, to be notified by the court
administrator in writing, at the named person's last known address, of (1) the date of the certification
or adjudicatory hearings, and (2) the disposition of the case.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.171, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Public inspection of records. (a) Legal records arising from proceedings or portions of
75TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010                                      7807

proceedings that ­a­e the court opens to the public under section 260B.163, subdivision 1, are open
                   r­
to public inspection.
   (b) Except as otherwise provided by this section, none of the records of the juvenile court and
none of the records relating to an appeal from a nonpublic juvenile court proceeding, except the
written appellate opinion, shall be open to public inspection or their contents disclosed except:
   (1) by order of a court; or
   (2) as required by chapter 245C or sections 245A.04, 611A.03, 611A.04, 611A.06, and 629.73.
    (c) The victim of any alleged delinquent act may, upon the victim's request, obtain the following
information, unless it reasonably appears that the request is prompted by a desire on the part of the
requester to engage in unlawful activities:
   (1) the name and age of the juvenile;
   (2) the act for which the juvenile was petitioned and date of the offense; and
   (3) the disposition, including, but not limited to, dismissal of the petition, diversion, probation
and conditions of probation, detention, fines, or restitution.
    (d) The records of juvenile probation officers and county home schools are records of the
court for the purposes of this subdivision. Court services data relating to delinquent acts that
are contained in records of the juvenile court may be released as allowed under section 13.84,
subdivision 6. This subdivision applies to all proceedings under this chapter, including appeals
from orders of the juvenile court, except that this subdivision does not apply to proceedings under
section 260B.335 or 260B.425 when the proceeding involves an adult defendant. The court shall
maintain the confidentiality of adoption files and records in accordance with the provisions of laws
relating to adoptions. In juvenile court proceedings any report or social history furnished to the
court shall be open to inspection by the attorneys of record and the guardian ad litem a reasonable
time before it is used in connection with any proceeding before the court.
    (e) When a judge of a juvenile court, or duly authorized agent of the court, determines under a
proceeding under this chapter that a child has violated a state or local law, ordinance, or regulation
pertaining to the operation of a motor vehicle on streets and highways, except parking violations,
the judge or agent shall immediately report the violation to the commissioner of public safety. The
report must be made on a form provided by the Department of Public Safety and must contain the
information required under section 169.95.
    (f) A county attorney may give a law enforcement agency that referred a delinquency matter to
the county attorney a summary of the results of that referral, including the details of any juvenile
court disposition.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.171, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Peace officer records of children. (a) Except for records relating to an offense where
the court opens the proceedings ­  a­
                                    r­
                                     e to the public under section 260B.163, subdivision 1, Peace
officers' records of children who are or may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts
shall be kept separate from records of persons 18 years of age or older and are private data but
shall be disseminated: (1) by order of the juvenile court, (2) as required by section 121A.28, (3) as
7808                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [75TH DAY

authorized under section 13.82, subdivision 2, (4) to the child or the child's parent or guardian unless
disclosure of a record would interfere with an ongoing investigation, (5) to the Minnesota crime
victims reparations board as required by section 611A.56, subdivision 2, clause (6), for the purpose
of processing claims for crime victims reparations, or (6) as otherwise provided in this subdivision.
Except as provided in paragraph (c), no photographs of a child taken into custody may be taken
without the consent of the juvenile court unless the child is alleged to have violated section 169A.20.
Peace officers' records containing data about children who are victims of crimes or witnesses to
crimes must be administered consistent with section 13.82, subdivisions 2, 3, 6, and 17. Any person
violating any of the provisions of this subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
    In the case of computerized records maintained about juveniles by peace officers, the
requirement of this subdivision that records about juveniles must be kept separate from adult
records does not mean that a law enforcement agency must keep its records concerning juveniles
on a separate computer system. Law enforcement agencies may keep juvenile records on the same
computer as adult records and may use a common index to access both juvenile and adult records
so long as the agency has in place procedures that keep juvenile records in a separate place in
computer storage and that comply with the special data retention and other requirements associated
with protecting data on juveniles.
   (b) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the exchange of information by law enforcement
agencies if the exchanged information is pertinent and necessary for law enforcement purposes.
    (c) A photograph may be taken of a child taken into custody pursuant to section 260B.175,
subdivision 1, clause (b), provided that the photograph must be destroyed when the child reaches
the age of 19 years. The commissioner of corrections may photograph juveniles whose legal
custody is transferred to the commissioner. Photographs of juveniles authorized by this paragraph
may be used only for institution management purposes, case supervision by parole agents, and to
assist law enforcement agencies to apprehend juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall maintain
photographs of juveniles in the same manner as juvenile court records and names under this section.
    (d) Traffic investigation reports are open to inspection by a person who has sustained physical
harm or economic loss as a result of the traffic accident. Identifying information on juveniles who
are parties to traffic accidents may be disclosed as authorized under section 13.82, subdivision 6, and
accident reports required under section 169.09 may be released under section 169.09, subdivision
13, unless the information would identify a juvenile who was taken into custody or who is suspected
of committing an offense that would be a crime if committed by an adult, or would associate a
juvenile with the offense, and the offense is not an adult court traffic offense under section 260B.225.
    (e) The head of a law enforcement agency or a person specifically given the duty by the head
of the law enforcement agency shall notify the superintendent or chief administrative officer of a
juvenile's school of an incident occurring within the agency's jurisdiction if:
    (1) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense that
would be a crime if committed as an adult, that the victim of the offense is a student or staff member
of the school, and that notice to the school is reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim;
or
    (2) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense described
in subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3), that would be a crime if committed by an adult,
regardless of whether the victim is a student or staff member of the school.
75TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010                                        7809

    A law enforcement agency is not required to notify the school under this paragraph if the agency
determines that notice would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. For purposes of this paragraph,
"school" means a public or private elementary, middle, secondary, or charter school.
   (f) In any county in which the county attorney operates or authorizes the operation of a juvenile
prepetition or pretrial diversion program, a law enforcement agency or county attorney's office may
provide the juvenile diversion program with data concerning a juvenile who is a participant in or is
being considered for participation in the program.
   (g) Upon request of a local social services agency, peace officer records of children who are or
may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts may be disseminated to the agency to
promote the best interests of the subject of the data.
    (h) Upon written request, the prosecuting authority shall release investigative data collected by
a law enforcement agency to the victim of a criminal act or alleged criminal act or to the victim's
legal representative, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph. Data shall not be released if:
   (1) the release to the individual subject of the data would be prohibited under section 13.821; or
   (2) the prosecuting authority reasonably believes:
   (i) that the release of that data will interfere with the investigation; or
    (ii) that the request is prompted by a desire on the part of the requester to engage in unlawful
activities.
    (i) A consent to the release of a peace officer record governed by this subdivision from the
individual who is the subject of the record is not effective and a law enforcement agency must not
release the record or release information in a manner that reveals the existence of the record.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.176, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Reasons for detention. (a) If the child is not released as provided in subdivision 1, the
person taking the child into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the
child and the reasons for detention.
    (b) No child may be detained in a juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility longer
than 36 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after being taken into custody for a
delinquent act as defined in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless a petition has been filed and the
judge or referee determines pursuant to section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in detention.
    (c) No child may be detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a
standard metropolitan statistical area, after being taken into custody for a delinquent act as defined
in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless:
   (1) a petition has been filed under section 260B.141; and
    (2) a judge or referee has determined under section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in
detention.
   After August 1, 1991, no child described in this paragraph may be detained in an adult jail or
7810                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than
six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a standard metropolitan statistical area, unless the
requirements of this paragraph have been met and, in addition, a motion to refer the child for adult
prosecution has been made under section 260B.125. Notwithstanding this paragraph, continued
detention of a child in an adult detention facility outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area
county is permissible if:
    (i) the facility in which the child is detained is located where conditions of distance to be traveled
or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours. A delay not to
exceed 48 hours may be made under this clause; or
    (ii) the facility is located where conditions of safety exist. Time for an appearance may be delayed
until 24 hours after the time that conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. "Conditions of safety"
include adverse life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel.
    The continued detention of a child under clause (i) or (ii) must be reported to the commissioner
of corrections.
    (d) If a child described in paragraph (c) is to be detained in a jail beyond 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the judge or referee, in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the commissioner of corrections, shall notify the commissioner of the place of
the detention and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall thereupon assist the court in the
relocation of the child in an appropriate juvenile secure detention facility or approved jail within
the county or elsewhere in the state, or in determining suitable alternatives. The commissioner
shall direct that a child detained in a jail be detained after eight days from and including the date of
the original detention order in an approved juvenile secure detention facility with the approval of
the administrative authority of the facility. If the court refers the matter to the prosecuting authority
pursuant to section 260B.125, notice to the commissioner shall not be required.
     (e) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a children's
mental health screening conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of
human services, unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child
is currently under the care of a mental health professional. The screening shall be conducted by a
mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who
is trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention. The
results of the screening may only be presented to the court at the dispositional phase of the court
proceedings on the matter unless the parent or legal guardian consents to presentation at a different
time. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency or probation
officer, with the approval of the child's parent or legal guardian, shall have a diagnostic assessment
conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    (f) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a chemical
use screen conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services,
unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child is currently under
75TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010                                           7811

the care of a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. The screening shall be conducted by a mental
health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is
trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.198, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Continuance. When it is in the best interests of the child and public safety to do
so and when the child has admitted the allegations contained in the petition before the judge or
referee, or when a hearing has been held as provided for in section 260B.163 and the allegations
contained in the petition have been duly proven but, in either case, before a finding of delinquency

by paragraph (b) or (c), expungement of a criminal or delinquency record is an extraordinary remedy
to be granted only upon clear and convincing evidence that it would yield a benefit to the petitioner
commensurate with the disadvantages to the public and public safety of:
   (1) sealing the record; and
   (2) burdening the court and public authorities to issue, enforce, and monitor an expungement
order.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, If the petitioner is petitioning for the
sealing of a criminal or delinquency record under section 609A.02, subdivision 3, the court shall
grant the petition to seal the record unless the agency or jurisdiction whose records would be
affected establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the interests of the public and public
safety outweigh the disadvantages to the petitioner of not sealing the record.
    (c) If the petitioner is petitioning for the sealing of a criminal or delinquency record under section
609A.02, subdivision 2, clause (1) or (2), the court shall grant the petition to seal the record unless the
agency or jurisdiction whose records would be affected establishes by clear and convincing evidence
that the interests of the public and public safety outweigh the disadvantages to the petitioner of not
sealing the record.
   (d) If the court issues an expungement order it may require that the criminal or delinquency
record be sealed, the existence of the record not be revealed, and the record not be opened except as
required under subdivision 7. Records must not be destroyed or returned to the subject of the record.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609A.03, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Order concerning crimes of violence. An order expunging the record of a conviction
or delinquency record for a crime of violence as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 5, must
provide that the person is not entitled to ship, transport, possess, or receive a firearm for the
remainder of the person's lifetime. Any person whose record of conviction or delinquency record
is expunged under this section and who thereafter receives a relief of disability under United States
Code, title 18, section 925, or whose ability to possess firearms has been restored under section
609.165, subdivision 1d, is not subject to the restriction in this subdivision.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609A.03, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Limitations of order. (a) Upon issuance of an expungement order related to a charge
supported by probable cause, the DNA samples and DNA records held by the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension and collected under authority other than section 299C.105, shall not be sealed,
returned to the subject of the record, or destroyed.
   (b) Notwithstanding the issuance of an expungement order:
   (1) an expunged record may be opened for purposes of a criminal investigation, prosecution, or
sentencing, upon an ex parte court order;
    (2) an expunged record of a conviction or delinquency proceeding may be opened for purposes
of evaluating a prospective employee in a criminal justice agency without a court order; and
   (3) an expunged record of a conviction or delinquency proceeding may be opened for purposes

of a background study under section 245C.08 unless the court order for expungement is directed
specifically to the commissioner of human services.
    Upon request by law enforcement, prosecution, or corrections authorities, an agency or
jurisdiction subject to an expungement order shall inform the requester of the existence of a
sealed record and of the right to obtain access to it as provided by this paragraph. For purposes of
this section, a "criminal justice agency" means courts or a government agency that performs the
administration of criminal justice under statutory authority.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 624.713, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Ineligible persons. The following persons shall not be entitled to possess a pistol
or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon or, except for clause (1), any other firearm:
    (1) a person under the age of 18 years except that a person under 18 may carry or possess a
pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon (i) in the actual presence or under the direct
supervision of the person's parent or guardian, (ii) for the purpose of military drill under the auspices
of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision, (iii) for the purpose
of instruction, competition, or target practice on a firing range approved by the chief of police or
county sheriff in whose jurisdiction the range is located and under direct supervision; or (iv) if
the person has successfully completed a course designed to teach marksmanship and safety with a
pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon and approved by the commissioner of natural
resources;
    (2) except as otherwise provided in clause (9), a person who has been convicted of, or adjudicated
delinquent or received a stay of adjudication of delinquency or convicted as an extended jurisdiction
juvenile for committing, in this state or elsewhere, a crime of violence. For purposes of this section,
crime of violence includes crimes in other states or jurisdictions which would have been crimes of
violence as herein defined if they had been committed in this state;
    (3) a person who is or has ever been committed in Minnesota or elsewhere by a judicial
determination that the person is mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or mentally ill and
dangerous to the public, as defined in section 253B.02, to a treatment facility, or who has ever been
found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of mental illness, unless the person's ability
to possess a firearm has been restored under subdivision 4;
    (4) a person who has been convicted in Minnesota or elsewhere of a misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor violation of chapter 152, unless three years have elapsed since the date of conviction
and, during that time, the person has not been convicted of any other such violation of chapter

    The prohibition in this subdivision relating to the possession of firearms other than pistols
and semiautomatic military-style assault weapons does not apply retroactively to persons who

of violence in clause (2), applies only to offenders who are discharged from sentence or court
supervision for a crime of violence on or after August 1, 1993.

that the defendant is prohibited from possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault
weapon for the remainder of the person's lifetime, and that it is a felony offense to violate this
prohibition. The failure of the court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect the
applicability of the pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon possession prohibition or
the felony penalty to that defendant.
     (b) When a person, including a person under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, is charged
with committing a crime of violence and is placed in a pretrial diversion program by the court

it is a gross misdemeanor offense to violate this prohibition; and (3) if the defendant violates this
condition of participation in the diversion program, the charge of committing a crime of violence

    Subd. 2. Secure placement of juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall license several small
regional facilities providing secure capacity programming for juveniles who have been adjudicated
delinquent, have received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, or have been convicted as extended
jurisdiction juveniles and require secure placement. The programming shall be tailored to the types
of juveniles being served, including their offense history, age, gender, cultural and ethnic heritage,

delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency, than to the other factors
listed in this subdivision.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to be
delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600
to 9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse
the court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall order a children's mental health screening conducted when a child is found
to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a screening instrument approved by the
commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by a mental health practitioner as defined
in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is trained in the use of the screening
instrument. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency, in
consultation with the child's family, shall have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a
functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, in order that
the condition of the minor be given due consideration in the disposition of the case. Any funds
received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not cancel until the end of the fiscal year

conviction occurred in this state.
    A person who issues a certificate pursuant to this section in good faith is not liable for damages
resulting or arising from the actions or misconduct with a firearm committed by the individual who
is the subject of the certificate.
    The prohibition in this subdivision relating to the possession of firearms other than pistols
and semiautomatic military-style assault weapons does not apply retroactively to persons who
are prohibited from possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon under this
subdivision before August 1, 1994.
   The lifetime prohibition on possessing, receiving, shipping, or transporting firearms for persons
convicted or adjudicated delinquent or received a stay of adjudication of delinquency of a crime
of violence in clause (2), applies only to offenders who are discharged from sentence or court
supervision for a crime of violence on or after August 1, 1993.
    For purposes of this section, "judicial determination" means a court proceeding pursuant to
sections 253B.07 to 253B.09 or a comparable law from another state.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 624.713, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice. (a) When a person is convicted of, or adjudicated delinquent, received a stay
of adjudication of delinquency, or convicted as an extended jurisdiction juvenile for committing, a
crime of violence as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 5, the court shall inform the defendant
that the defendant is prohibited from possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault
weapon for the remainder of the person's lifetime, and that it is a felony offense to violate this
prohibition. The failure of the court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect the
applicability of the pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon possession prohibition or
the felony penalty to that defendant.
     (b) When a person, including a person under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, is charged
with committing a crime of violence and is placed in a pretrial diversion program by the court
before disposition, the court shall inform the defendant that: (1) the defendant is prohibited from
possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon until the person has completed
the diversion program and the charge of committing a crime of violence has been dismissed; (2)
it is a gross misdemeanor offense to violate this prohibition; and (3) if the defendant violates this
condition of participation in the diversion program, the charge of committing a crime of violence
may be prosecuted. The failure of the court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect
the applicability of the pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon possession prohibition
or the gross misdemeanor penalty to that defendant."

utility in connection with implementation of the project in the next rate case following an advance
determination of prudence. The commission shall review the costs incurred by the utility for the
project. The utility must show that the project costs are reasonable and necessary, and demonstrate
its efforts to ensure the lowest reasonable project costs. Notwithstanding the commission's prior
determination of prudence, it may accept, modify, or reject any of the project costs. The commission
may determine whether to require an allowance for funds used during construction offset.
   Subd. 6. Expiration. A petition for an advance determination of prudence may not be filed after

    Subd. 3. Correction and deletion of records. (a) If the completeness or accuracy of a criminal
record maintained by a business screening service is disputed by the individual who is the subject of
the record, the screening service shall, without charge, investigate the disputed record. In conducting
an investigation, the business screening service shall review and consider all relevant information
submitted by the subject of the record with respect to the disputed record to determine whether the
record maintained by the screening service accurately reflects the content of the official record, as
maintained by the official government custodian.

or deletion of the record or of the termination or completion of the investigation related to the record
within 30 days of the date when the agency receives notice of the dispute from the subject of the

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.72, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Computation of deferred annuity. (a) The deferred annuity, if any, accruing under
subdivision 1, or section 352.22, subdivision 3, must be computed as provided in section 352.22,
subdivision 3, on the basis of allowable service before termination of state service and augmented
as provided herein. The required reserves applicable to a deferred annuity or to an annuity for which
a former employee was eligible but had not applied or to any deferred segment of an annuity must
be determined as of the date the benefit begins to accrue and augmented by interest compounded
annually from the first day of the month following the month in which the employee ceased to
be a state employee, or July 1, 1971, whichever is later, to the first day of the month in which the
annuity begins to accrue. The rates of interest used for this purpose must be five percent compounded
annually until January 1, 1981, and three percent compounded annually thereafter until January 1
of the year following the year in which the former employee attains age 55 or until January 1, 2011,

compounded annually until January 1, 2011, if the employee becomes an employee after June 30,
2006, and two percent compounded annually after December 31, 2010, irrespective of when the
employee became a state employee. If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service,
the required reserves related to each period must be augmented by interest under this subdivision.
The sum of the augmented required reserves so determined is the present value of the annuity.
"Uninterrupted service" for the purpose of this subdivision means periods of covered employment
during which the employee has not been separated from state service for more than two years. If a
person repays a refund, the service restored by the repayment must be considered continuous with the
next period of service for which the employee has credit with this system. The formula percentages
used for each period of uninterrupted service must be those applicable to a new employee. The
mortality table and interest assumption used to compute the annuity must be those in effect when the
employee files application for annuity. This section does not reduce the annuity otherwise payable
under this chapter.
    (b) The retirement annuity or disability benefit of, or the survivor benefit payable on behalf
of, a former state employee who terminated service before July 1, 1997, which is not first payable
until after June 30, 1997, must be increased on an actuarial equivalent basis to reflect the change
in the postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, from
five percent to six percent under a calculation procedure and the tables adopted by the board and
approved by the actuary retained under section 356.214.

Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document in effect on December 31, 1977,
subject to an early retirement reduction or adjustment in amount on account of retirement before
the normal retirement age specified in that former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document.
    The deferred retirement annuity of any person to whom this subdivision applies must be
augmented. The required reserves applicable to the deferred retirement annuity, determined as

    (2) greater than 1.99 percent and less than 4.01 percent, the incremental increase may be up to
0.5 percent for the employee and matching employer contribution rates; or
   (3) greater than four percent, the incremental increase may be up to 0.75 percent for the employee
and matching employer contribution.
    (e) Any recommended adjustment to the contribution rates must be reported to the chair and
the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement by January 15
following receipt of the most recent annual actuarial valuation prepared under section 356.215. If the
Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement does not recommend against the rate change
or does not recommend a modification in the rate change, the recommended adjustment becomes
effective on the first day of the first full payroll period in the fiscal year following receipt of the most
recent actuarial valuation that gave rise to the adjustment.
    (f) A contribution sufficiency of up to one percent of covered payroll must be held in reserve to
be used to offset any future actuarially required contributions that are more than the total combined
employee and employer contributions under subdivisions 2, 3, and 3a.
    (g) Before any reduction in contributions to eliminate a sufficiency in excess of one percent of
covered pay may be recommended, the executive director must review any need for a change in
actuarial assumptions, as recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214 in the most
recent experience study of the general employees retirement plan prepared under section 356.215
and the standards for actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement that may result in an increase in the actuarially required contribution and must report
to the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement any recommendation by the board to
use the sufficiency exceeding one percent of covered payroll to offset the impact of an actuarial
assumption change recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision 1, and
reviewed by the actuary retained by the commission under section 356.214, subdivision 4.

    (h) No contribution sufficiency in excess of one percent of covered pay may be proposed to be
used to increase benefits, and no benefit increase may be proposed that would initiate an automatic
adjustment to increase contributions under this subdivision. Any proposed benefit improvement
must include a recommendation, prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision
1, and reviewed by the actuary retained by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
as provided under section 356.214, subdivision 4, on how the benefit modification will be funded.

who is vested under section 353.01, subdivision 47, dies, but did not qualify for retirement on the
date of death, the surviving spouse may elect to receive a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity
computed using section 353.30, subdivision 1c or 5, as applicable, except that the early retirement
reduction specified in the applicable subdivision will be applied to age 55 and one-half of the early
retirement reduction from age 55 back to the age payment begins.
    (d) Notwithstanding the definition of surviving spouse in section 353.01, subdivision 20, a
former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the monthly surviving spouse
optional annuity if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the
association. If there is no surviving spouse or child or children, a former spouse may be entitled to
a lump-sum refund payment under subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution decree,
but not a monthly surviving spouse optional annuity, despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (e) The surviving spouse eligible for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (a) may apply
for the annuity at any time after the date on which the deceased employee would have attained the
required age for retirement based on the employee's allowable service. The surviving spouse eligible
for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (b) or (c) may apply for an annuity any time after the
member's death.
   (f) Sections 353.34, subdivision 3, and 353.71, subdivision 2, apply to a deferred annuity or
surviving spouse benefit payable under this subdivision.
   (g) An amount equal to any excess of the accumulated contributions that were credited to the
account of the deceased employee over and above the total of the annuities paid and payable to the
surviving spouse must be paid to the surviving spouse's estate.
    (h) A member may specify in writing, with the signed consent of the spouse, that this subdivision
does not apply and that payment may be made only to the designated beneficiary as otherwise
provided by this chapter. The waiver of a surviving spouse annuity under this section does not make
a dependent child eligible for benefits under subdivision 1c.
    (i) If the deceased member or former member first became a public employee or a member of a
public pension plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, on or after July 1, 1989, a survivor annuity
computed under paragraph (a) or (c) must be computed as specified in section 353.30, subdivision
5, except for the revised early retirement reduction specified in paragraph (c), if paragraph (c) is the
applicable provision.

either who is vested under section 353.01, subdivision 47, or who has credit for at least 30 years of
allowable service, regardless of age attained, dies before the annuity or disability benefit becomes
payable, notwithstanding any designation of beneficiary to the contrary, the surviving spouse may
elect to receive a death while eligible survivor benefit.
    (b) Notwithstanding the definition of surviving spouse in section 353.01, subdivision 20, a
former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the death while eligible survivor
benefit if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the association. If

refund payment under section 353.32, subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution
decree but not a death while eligible survivor benefit despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (c) The benefit may be elected instead of a refund with interest under section 353.32, subdivision
1, or surviving spouse benefits otherwise payable under subdivisions 1 and 2. The benefit must be an
annuity equal to the 100 percent joint and survivor annuity which the member could have qualified
for on the date of death, computed as provided in sections 353.651, subdivisions 2 and 3, and 353.30,
subdivision 3.
    (d) The surviving spouse may apply for the annuity at any time after the date on which the
deceased employee would have attained the required age for retirement based on the employee's
allowable service. Sections 353.34, subdivision 3, and 353.71, subdivision 2, apply to a deferred
annuity payable under this subdivision.
     (e) No payment accrues beyond the end of the month in which entitlement to such annuity has
terminated. An amount equal to the excess, if any, of the accumulated contributions which were
credited to the account of the deceased employee over and above the total of the annuities paid and
payable to the surviving spouse must be paid to the deceased member's last designated beneficiary
or, if none, to the legal representative of the estate of such deceased member.
   (f) Any member may request in writing, with the signed consent of the spouse, that this
subdivision not apply and that payment be made only to the designated beneficiary, as otherwise
provided by this chapter.
    (g) For a member who is employed as a full-time firefighter by the Department of Military
Affairs of the state of Minnesota, allowable service as a full-time state Military Affairs Department
firefighter credited by the Minnesota State Retirement System may be used in meeting the minimum
allowable service requirement of this subdivision.

    (c) For a person who became a public employee after June 30, 2006, and who terminated
public employment before January 1, 2011, the required reserves of the deferred annuity must be
augmented at 2.5 percent annual compound interest from the date of termination of public service

each period must be augmented as specified in this paragraph. The sum of the augmented required
reserves is the present value of the annuity. Uninterrupted service for the purpose of this subdivision
means periods of covered employment during which the employee has not been separated from
public service for more than two years. If a person repays a refund, the restored service must be

    (d) After June 30, 2015, if a contribution rate revision is made under subdivisions 4a, 4b, and
4c, the employer contributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) must be adjusted accordingly.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Determination. (a) For purposes of this section, a contribution sufficiency exists if
the total of the employee contributions, the employer contributions, and any additional employer
contributions, if applicable, exceeds the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses,
and the amortization contribution of the retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial
valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the approved actuary retained under section 356.214
and prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a contribution deficiency exists if the total of the employee
contributions, the employer contributions, and any additional employer contributions are less than
the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses, and the amortization contribution of the
retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation of the retirement plan prepared by
the approved actuary retained under section 356.214 and prepared under section 356.215 and the
standards for actuarial work of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4b. Contribution rate revision. Notwithstanding the contribution rate provisions under
subdivisions 2 and 3, the employee and employer contribution rates may be adjusted as follows:
    (1) if, after June 30, 2015, the regular actuarial valuation of the plan under section 356.215
indicates that there is a contribution sufficiency under subdivision 4a equal to or greater than one
percent of covered payroll and the sufficiency has existed for at least two consecutive years, the
employee and employer contribution rates for the plan may each be decreased to a level such that
the sufficiency equals no more than one percent of covered payroll based on the most recent actuarial
valuation; or
    (2) if, after June 30, 2015, the regular valuation of the plan under section 356.215 indicates that
there is a deficiency equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of covered payroll and the deficiency has
existed for at least two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution rates for the
applicable plan may each be increased by:
   (i) 0.25 percent if the deficiency is less than 2.00 percent of covered payroll;
    (ii) 0.5 percent if the deficiency is equal to or greater than 2.00 percent of covered payroll and
less than or equal to four percent; and
   (iii) 0.75 percent if the deficiency is greater than four percent.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

   Subd. 4c. Contribution sufficiency measures. (a) A contribution sufficiency of up to one
percent of covered payroll must be held in reserve to be used to offset any future actuarially
required contributions that are more than the total combined employee and employer contributions
being collected.
    (b) Before any reduction in contributions to eliminate a sufficiency in excess of one percent
of covered pay may be recommended, the executive director must review any need for a change
in actuarial assumptions, as recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214 in the
most recent experience study of the retirement plan, that may result in an increase in the actuarially
required contribution and must report to the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
any recommendation by the board to use the sufficiency exceeding one percent of covered payroll
to offset the impact of an actuarial assumption change recommended by the actuary retained under
section 356.214, subdivision 1, and reviewed by the actuary retained by the commission under
section 356.214, subdivision 4.
    (c) A contribution sufficiency in excess of one percent of covered pay must not be used to
increase benefits, and a benefit increase must not be proposed that would initiate an automatic
adjustment under this section to increase contributions. A proposed benefit improvement must
include a recommendation, prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision 1,
and reviewed by the actuary retained by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement,
as provided under section 356.214, subdivision 4, on the manner in which the benefit modification
is to be funded.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4d. Reporting; commission review. A contribution rate increase or decrease under
subdivision 4b, as determined by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association,
must be reported to the chair and the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions
and Retirement on or before the next February 1 and, if the Legislative Commission on Pensions
and Retirement does not recommend against the rate change or does not recommend a modification
in the rate change, is effective on the next July 1 following the determination by the executive
director that a contribution deficiency or sufficiency exists based on the most recent actuarial
valuation under section 356.215.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 354.47, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Death before retirement. (a) If a member dies before retirement and is covered
under section 354.44, subdivision 2, and neither an optional annuity, nor a reversionary annuity, nor
a benefit under section 354.46, subdivision 1, is payable to the survivors if the member was a basic
member, then the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, the designated beneficiary
is entitled to an amount equal to the member's accumulated deductions with interest credited to
the account of the member to the date of death of the member. If the designated beneficiary is a
minor, interest must be credited to the date the beneficiary reaches legal age, or the date of receipt,

    (b) The amount of the deferred retirement annuity is determined by section 354.44, subdivision
6, and augmented as provided in this subdivision. The required reserves for the annuity which
had accrued when the member ceased to render teaching service must be augmented, as further
specified in this subdivision, by the applicable interest rate compounded annually from the first day
of the month following the month during which the member ceased to render teaching service to
the effective date of retirement.
   (c) No augmentation is not creditable if the deferral period is less than three months or if deferral
commenced before July 1, 1971.

30, 2011, whichever is earlier; and
    (4) two percent interest compounded annually after June 30, 2011.
    (e) For persons who become covered employees after June 30, 2006, the interest rate used to
augment the deferred annuity is 2.5 percent interest compounded annually until June 30, 2011, or
until the effective date of retirement, whichever is earlier, and two percent interest compounded
annually after June 30, 2011.
    (f) If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service, a separate average salary
determined under section 354.44, subdivision 6, must be used for each period and the required
reserves related to each period must be augmented as specified in this subdivision. The sum of the
augmented required reserves is the present value of the annuity. For the purposes of this subdivision,
"period of uninterrupted service" means a period of covered teaching service during which the
member has not been separated from active service for more than one fiscal year.
   (g) If a person repays a refund, the service restored by the repayment must be considered as
continuous with the next period of service for which the person has allowable service credit in the
Teachers Retirement Association.
    (h) If a person does not render teaching service in any one fiscal year or more consecutive
fiscal years and then resumes teaching service, the formula percentages used from the date of the
resumption of teaching service must be those applicable to new members.
    (i) The mortality table and interest rate actuarial assumption used to compute the annuity must
be the applicable mortality table established by the board under section 354.07, subdivision 1, and
the interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215 in effect when the member retires.
   (j) In no case may the annuity payable under this subdivision be less than the amount of annuity
payable under section 354.44, subdivision 6.
    (k) The requirements and provisions for retirement before normal retirement age contained

in section 354.44, subdivision 6, also apply to an employee fulfilling the requirements with a
combination of service as provided in section 354.60.
   (l) The augmentation provided by this subdivision applies to the benefit provided in section
354.46, subdivision 2.
   (m) The augmentation provided by this subdivision does not apply to any period in which a
person is on an approved leave of absence from an employer unit covered by the provisions of this
chapter.
    (n) The retirement annuity or disability benefit of, or the survivor benefit payable on behalf
of, a former teacher who terminated service before July 1, 1997, which is not first payable until
after June 30, 1997, must be increased on an actuarial equivalent basis to reflect the change in
the postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, from five
percent to six percent under a calculation procedure and tables adopted by the board as recommended
by an approved actuary and approved by the actuary retained under section 356.214.

    (a) For purposes of computing postretirement adjustments after the effective date of this section
for eligible benefit recipients of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the funding ratio
of the plan, as determined by dividing the market value of assets by the actuarial accrued liability
as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.214 and 356.215,
determines the postretirement increase as follows:
                       Funding Ratio                                                    Postretirement Increase
                       less than 80 percent                                             0 percent
                       at least 80 percent but less than 90 percent 1 percent
                       at least 90 percent                                              2 percent

   (b) If the funding ratio of the plan based on actuarial value, rather than market value, is at least
90 percent as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.214 and
356.215, this subdivision expires and subsequent postretirement increases must be paid as specified
under subdivision 7.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.

   Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.27, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 7. Calculation of postretirement adjustments. (a) This subdivision applies if
subdivision 6 has expired.
    (b) A percentage adjustment must be computed and paid under this subdivision to eligible
persons under subdivision 5. This adjustment is determined by reference to the Consumer Price
Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination
of annual cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance. For calculations of cost-of-living adjustments under paragraph (c), the term "average
third quarter Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided
by 3.
   (c) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
cost-of-living adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the same
average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting quotient,
and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
one percent.
    (d) The amount calculated under paragraph (c) is the full cost-of-living adjustment to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred
during the calendar year before the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, the full increase amount
must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar
year prior to the January 1 on which the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, calculated to the third
decimal place.
   (e) The adjustment must not be less than zero nor greater than five percent.

   Sec. 63. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.35, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Death before retirement; refund. If a coordinated member or former
coordinated member dies prior to retirement or prior to the receipt of any retirement annuity or
other benefit payment which is or may be payable and a surviving spouse optional annuity is not
payable pursuant to subdivision 2, a refund shall be paid to the person's surviving spouse, or if there
is none, to the person's designated beneficiary, or if there is none, to the legal representative of the
person's estate. For a coordinated member or former coordinated member of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, the refund shall be in an amount equal to the person's accumulated
employee contributions plus interest at the rate of six percent per annum compounded annually.
For a coordinated member or former coordinated member of the Duluth Teachers Retirement
Fund Association, the refund shall be in an amount equal to the person's accumulated employee
contributions plus interest at the rate of six percent per annum compounded annually to July 1,
2010, and four percent per annum compounded annually thereafter.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility for deferred retirement annuity. (a) Any coordinated member who ceases
to render teaching services for the school district in which the teachers retirement fund association is
located, with sufficient allowable service credit to meet the minimum service requirements specified
in section 354A.31, subdivision 1, shall be entitled to a deferred retirement annuity in lieu of a
refund pursuant to subdivision 1. The deferred retirement annuity shall be computed pursuant to
section 354A.31 and shall be augmented as provided in this subdivision. The deferred annuity shall
commence upon application after the person on deferred status attains at least the minimum age
specified in section 354A.31, subdivision 1.
    (b) The monthly annuity amount that had accrued when the member ceased to render teaching
service must be augmented from the first day of the month following the month during which
the member ceased to render teaching service to the effective date of retirement. There is no
augmentation if this period is less than three months. For a member of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, the rate of augmentation is three percent compounded annually
until January 1 of the year following the year in which the former member attains age 55, and five
percent compounded annually after that date to the effective date of retirement if the employee
became an employee before July 1, 2006, and at 2.5 percent compounded annually if the employee
becomes an employee after June 30, 2006. For a member of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund
Association, the rate of augmentation is three percent compounded annually until January 1 of
the year following the year in which the former member attains age 55, five percent compounded
annually after that date to July 1, 2010, and two percent compounded annually after that date to the
effective date of retirement if the employee became an employee before July 1, 2006, and at 2.5
percent compounded annually to July 1, 2010, and two percent compounded annually after that
date to the effective date of retirement if the employee becomes an employee after June 30, 2006.
If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service, a separate average salary determined
under section 354A.31 must be used for each period, and the monthly annuity amount related to

each period must be augmented as provided in this subdivision. The sum of the augmented monthly
annuity amounts determines the total deferred annuity payable. If a person repays a refund, the
service restored by the repayment must be considered as continuous with the next period of service
for which the person has credit with the fund. If a person does not render teaching services in any
one fiscal year or more consecutive fiscal years and then resumes teaching service, the formula
percentages used from the date of resumption of teaching service are those applicable to new
members. The mortality table and interest assumption used to compute the annuity are the table
established by the fund to compute other annuities, and the interest assumption under section
356.215 in effect when the member retires. A period of uninterrupted service for the purpose of
this subdivision means a period of covered teaching service during which the member has not been
separated from active service for more than one fiscal year.
    (c) The augmentation provided by this subdivision applies to the benefit provided in section
354A.35, subdivision 2. The augmentation provided by this subdivision does not apply to any period
in which a person is on an approved leave of absence from an employer unit.

   (d) After July 1, 2010, the assumptions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) continue to apply,
unless a different salary assumption or a different payroll increase assumption:
   (1) has been proposed by the governing board of the applicable retirement plan;
   (2) is accompanied by the concurring recommendation of the actuary retained under section
356.214, subdivision 1, if applicable, or by the approved actuary preparing the most recent actuarial
valuation report if section 356.214 does not apply; and
   (3) has been approved or deemed approved under subdivision 18.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 68. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 356.215, subdivision 11, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must contain an exhibit for financial reporting
purposes indicating the additional annual contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability and must contain an exhibit for contribution determination purposes indicating
the additional contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For the
retirement plans listed in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), the additional contribution must be calculated
on a level percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full funding in effect when
the valuation is prepared, assuming annual payroll growth at the applicable percentage rate set forth
in subdivision 8, paragraph (c). For all other retirement plans, the additional annual contribution
must be calculated on a level annual dollar amount basis.
    (b) For any retirement plan other than the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the general
employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, the general state
employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System, and the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, if there has not been a change in the actuarial assumptions used
for calculating the actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing
annuities and benefits payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in
calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the
three, which change or changes by itself or by themselves without inclusion of any other items of
increase or decrease produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund,
the established date for full funding is the first actuarial valuation date occurring after June 1, 2020.

been a change in any or all of the actuarial assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued
liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the
fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all
or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the three, and the change or changes, by itself or by
themselves and without inclusion of any other items of increase or decrease, produce a net increase
in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the fund, the established date for full funding must be
determined using the following procedure:
   (i) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with the
plan provisions governing annuities and retirement benefits and the actuarial assumptions in effect
before an applicable change;
    (ii) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed
to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined under item (i) by the
established date for full funding in effect before the change must be calculated using the interest
assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;
    (iii) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with
any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
   (d) For the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the established date for full funding is
June 30, 2020.

has made application for benefits from each applicable plan and the effective dates of the retirement
annuity with each plan under which the person chooses to receive an annuity are within a one-year
period.
    (c) The retirement annuity from each plan must be based upon the allowable service, accrual
rates, and average salary in the applicable plan except as further specified or modified in the
following clauses:
    (1) the laws governing annuities must be the law in effect on the date of termination from the last
period of public service under a covered retirement plan with which the person earned a minimum
of one-half year of allowable service credit during that employment;
    (2) the "average salary" on which the annuity from each covered plan in which the employee has
credit in a formula plan must be based on the employee's highest five successive years of covered
salary during the entire service in covered plans;
   (3) the accrual rates to be used by each plan must be those percentages prescribed by each
plan's formula as continued for the respective years of allowable service from one plan to the next,
recognizing all previous allowable service with the other covered plans;
    (4) the allowable service in all the plans must be combined in determining eligibility for and the
application of each plan's provisions in respect to reduction in the annuity amount for retirement
prior to normal retirement age; and
   (5) the annuity amount payable for any allowable service under a nonformula plan of a covered
plan must not be affected, but such service and covered salary must be used in the above calculation.
   (d) This section does not apply to any person whose final termination from the last public service
under a covered plan was before May 1, 1975.
    (e) For the purpose of computing annuities under this section, the accrual rates used by any
covered plan, except the public employees police and fire plan, the judges retirement fund, and the
State Patrol retirement plan, must not exceed the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision
4, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The formula percentage used
by the judges retirement fund must not exceed the percentage rate specified in section 356.315,
subdivision 8, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate used
by the public employees police and fire plan and the State Patrol retirement plan must not exceed
the percentage rate specified in section 356.315, subdivision 6, per year of service for any year of
service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate or rates used by the legislators retirement plan must not
exceed 2.5 percent, but this limit does not apply to the adjustment provided under section 3A.02,
subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
   (f) Any period of time for which a person has credit in more than one of the covered plans must
be used only once for the purpose of determining total allowable service.
    (g) If the period of duplicated service credit is more than one-half year, or the person has credit for
more than one-half year, with each of the plans, each plan must apply its formula to a prorated service
credit for the period of duplicated service based on a fraction of the salary on which deductions were
paid to that fund for the period divided by the total salary on which deductions were paid to all plans
for the period.

    (h) If the period of duplicated service credit is less than one-half year, or when added to other
service credit with that plan is less than one-half year, the service credit must be ignored and a refund
of contributions made to the person in accord with that plan's refund provisions.

the taxpaying employer's account under section 268.045. That tax account must be maintained by

by the taxpaying employer under this paragraph may be paid directly by the taxpaying employer.
    (c) If the taxpaying employer that contracts with a person under paragraph (a) does not have a tax
account at the time of the execution of the contract, an account must be registered for the taxpaying
employer under section 268.042 and the new employer tax rate under section 268.051, subdivision
5, must be assigned. The tax account is then assigned to the person as provided for in paragraph (a).
    (d) A person that contracts with a taxpaying employer under paragraph (a) must, within 30
calendar days of the execution or termination of a contract, notify the commissioner by electronic
transmission, in a format prescribed by the commissioner, of that execution or termination. The
taxpaying employer's name, the account number assigned, and any other information required by

the assignment of the tax account under this section and the taxpaying employer's obligation under

waste disposal facility, and to provide for the closure of the facility and postclosure care required
under agency rules. Proof of financial responsibility is required of the operator or owner of a facility
receiving an original permit or a permit for expansion after adoption of the rules. Within 180 days of
the effective date of the rules or by July 1, 1987, whichever is later, proof of financial responsibility
is required of an operator or owner of a facility with a remaining capacity of more than five years or
500,000 cubic yards that is in operation at the time the rules are adopted. Compliance with the rules
and the requirements of paragraph (b) is a condition of obtaining or retaining a permit to operate
the facility.
    (b) A municipality, as defined in section 475.51, subdivision 2, including a sanitary district, that
owns or operates a solid waste disposal facility that was in operation on May 15, 1989, may meet its
financial responsibility for all or a portion of the contingency action portion of the reasonable and
necessary response costs at the facility by pledging its full faith and credit to meet its responsibility.
    The pledge must be made in accordance with the requirements in chapter 475 for issuing bonds
of the municipality, and the following additional requirements:
    (1) The governing body of the municipality shall enact an ordinance that clearly accepts
responsibility for the costs of contingency action at the facility and that reserves, during the
operating life of the facility and for the time period required in paragraph (a) after closure, a portion
of the debt limit of the municipality, as established under section 475.53 or other law, that is equal
to the total contingency action costs.
   (2) The municipality shall require that all collectors that haul to the facility implement a plan for
reducing solid waste by using volume-based pricing, recycling incentives, or other means.
    (3) When a municipality opts to meet a portion of its financial responsibility by relying on its
authority to issue bonds, it shall also begin setting aside in a dedicated long-term care trust fund
money that will cover a portion of the potential contingency action costs at the facility, the amount
to be determined by the agency for each facility based on at least the amount of waste deposited in
the disposal facility each year, and the likelihood and potential timing of conditions arising at the
facility that will necessitate response action. The agency may not require a municipality to set aside
more than five percent of the total cost in a single year.
   (4) A municipality shall have and consistently maintain an investment grade bond rating as a
condition of using bonding authority to meet financial responsibility under this section.
    (5) The municipality shall file with the commissioner of revenue its consent to have the amount
of its contingency action costs deducted from state aid payments otherwise due the municipality
and paid instead to the remediation fund created in section 116.155, if the municipality fails to
conduct the contingency action at the facility when ordered by the agency. If the agency notifies the
commissioner that the municipality has failed to conduct contingency action when ordered by the
agency, the commissioner shall deduct the amounts indicated by the agency from the state aids in
accordance with the consent filed with the commissioner.
   (6) The municipality shall file with the agency written proof that it has complied with the
requirements of paragraph (b).
   (c) The method for proving financial responsibility under paragraph (b) may not be applied to
a new solid waste disposal facility or to expansion of an existing facility, unless the expansion is

duration of longer than three years.
    (d) The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget for
guidance on the forms of financial assurance that are acceptable for private owners and public
owners, and in carrying out a periodic review of the adequacy of financial assurance for solid waste
disposal facilities. Financial assurance rules shall allow financial mechanisms to public owners of
solid waste disposal facilities that are appropriate to their status as subdivisions of the state.

    Within six months after the effective date of this section, and before publishing the rules
required for groundwater sensitivity and financial assurance in Minnesota Statutes, section 116.07,
subdivision 4, the Pollution Control Agency shall consult with experts and interested persons on
financial assurance adequacy for solid waste facilities, including, but not limited to, staff from
the Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Management and Budget, local governments,
private and public landfill operators, and environmental groups. The commissioner shall seek the
input to determine the adequacy of existing financial assurance rules to address environmental
risks, the length of time financial assurance is needed, based on the threat to human health and the
environment, the reliability of financial assurance in covering risks from land disposal of waste in
Minnesota and other states, and the role of private insurance.
