    Subd. 3. Certification of qualified investors. (a) Investors may apply to the commissioner for
certification as a qualified investor for a taxable year. The application must be in the form and
be made under the procedures specified by the commissioner, accompanied by an application fee
of $350. Application fees are deposited in the small business investment tax credit administration
account in the special revenue fund. The application for certification for 2010 must be made available
on the department's Web site by August 1, 2010. Applications for subsequent years' certification
must be made available on the department's Web site by November 1 of the preceding year.
    (b) Within 30 days of receiving an application for certification under this subdivision, the
commissioner must either certify the investor as satisfying the conditions required of a qualified
investor, request additional information from the investor, or reject the application for certification.
If the commissioner requests additional information from the investor, the commissioner must
either certify the investor or reject the application within 30 days of receiving the additional
information. If the commissioner neither certifies the investor nor rejects the application within 30
days of receiving the original application or within 30 days of receiving the additional information
requested, whichever is later, then the application is deemed rejected, and the commissioner must
refund the $350 application fee. An investor who applies for certification and is rejected may
reapply.
    (c) To receive certification, an investor must: (1) be a natural person; and (2) certify to the
commissioner that the investor will only invest in a transaction that is exempt under section 80A.46,
clause (13) or (14), or in a security registered under section 80A.50, paragraph (b).

greenhouse, and qualifying for classification as class 1b, 2a, or 2b under section 273.13, shall
be entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this section only if it is primarily devoted to
agricultural use, and meets the qualifications in subdivision 6, and either:
    (1) is the homestead of the owner, or of a surviving spouse, child, or sibling of the owner or is
real estate which is farmed with the real estate which contains the homestead property; or
    (2) has been in possession of the applicant, the applicant's spouse, parent, or sibling, or any
combination thereof, for a period of at least seven years prior to application for benefits under the
provisions of this section, or is real estate which is farmed with the real estate which qualifies under
this clause and is within four townships or cities or combination thereof from the qualifying real
estate; or
    (3) is the homestead of an individual who is part of an entity described in paragraph (b), clause
(1), (2), or (3); or
    (4) is in the possession of a nursery or greenhouse or an entity owned by a proprietor, partnership,
or corporation which also owns the nursery or greenhouse operations on the parcel or parcels,

the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land prior to the expiration of the three-year period
requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale in the year the land no longer qualifies requires
payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years;
sale during the second year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's
deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes for the prior year; and sale during the third year
the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes
shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or
no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the end of the three-year period, whichever comes
first, all deferred special assessments plus interest are payable in equal installments spread over
the time remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued to finance the improvement for
which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred special assessments
plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to
the collection of these installments. Penalties are not imposed on any such special assessments if
timely paid.

it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the real property at an arm's-length
transaction been used in lieu of the market value determined under subdivision 4. The additional
taxes shall be extended against the property on the tax list for the current year, provided that no
interest or penalties shall be levied on the additional taxes if timely paid and that the additional
taxes shall only be levied with respect to the current year plus two prior years that the property has
been valued and assessed under this section.

Payment 4            August 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all aid
                     entitlements except state paid property tax credits
Payment 6            September 30: 40 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                     aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits
Payment 8            October 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                     aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective immediately and applies retroactively to fiscal
year 2010 and later.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.45, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7b. Advance final payment. (a) Notwithstanding subdivisions 3 and 7, a school district
or charter school exceeding its expenditure limitations under section 123B.83 as of June 30 of the
prior fiscal year may receive a portion of its final payment for the current fiscal year on June 20, if
requested by the district or charter school. The amount paid under this subdivision must not exceed
the lesser of:
    (1) the difference between 90 percent and the current year payment percentage in subdivision
2, paragraph (d), in the current fiscal year times the sum of the district or charter school's general
education aid plus the aid adjustment in section 127A.50 for the current fiscal year; or
    (2) the amount by which the district's or charter school's net negative unreserved general fund
balance as of June 30 of the prior fiscal year exceeds 2.5 percent of the district or charter school's
expenditures for that fiscal year.
    (b) The state total advance final payment under this subdivision for any year must not exceed
$7,500,000. If the amount request exceeds $7,500,000, the advance final payment for each eligible
district must be reduced proportionately.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective immediately and applies retroactively to fiscal
year 2010 and later.

    Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the outstanding loan balance as projected by
the lender to the anticipated time of payment to the borrower of the final installment of committed
principal shall not exceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the property at inception of the loan.
If upon reappraisal of the property made at any time during the term of the loan, the projected
outstanding loan balance does not exceed 70 percent of the reappraised value of the property, the
schedule of the lender's installment payments may be extended and the amount of the committed
principal amount increased, provided the revised outstanding loan balance at payment of the lender's
final installment of committed principal does not exceed 80 percent of the reappraised value of the
property.
