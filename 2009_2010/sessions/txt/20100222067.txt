                                                                               February 18, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate

Dear President Metzen:
    I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 182, Senate File 2168, a bill that makes modifications
to the General Assistance Medical Care (GMAC) program.
   I initially vetoed this program in May 2009 because its costs were skyrocketing out of control,
and the program was badly in need of reform. Senate File 2168 does not represent meaningful reform
and does not address fundamental cost issues. It essentially re-establishes GAMC in its prior form,
while reducing provider reimbursement rates by 50 percent.
   I refer you further to both my veto letter of May 14, 2009, regarding a line-item veto of the
program, as well as my letter to the House of Representatives from earlier today outlining my
continuing concerns.
    As the state struggles to resolve a $1.2 billion deficit, passage of this legislation is at best
premature. Legislation that appropriates significant funds simply cannot be passed in a piecemeal
fashion. A comprehensive, balanced budget solution must first be reached.
   This legislation utilizes $170 million that I previously identified in my supplemental budget to
help resolve the current $1.2 billion deficit. Those same dollars cannot be used twice.
    If a comprehensive budget solution is achieved, I remain open to working with you on these
issues.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2168 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                 REPORTS OF COMMITTEES

   Senator Pogemiller moved that the Committee Reports at the Desk be now adopted. The motion
prevailed.

    Senator Marty from the Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security, to which was
referred
    S.F. No. 2505: A bill for an act relating to child care; appropriating money to provide statewide
child care provider training, coaching, consultation, and supports to prepare for the voluntary
Minnesota quality rating system.
  Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill do pass and be re-referred to the
Committee on Finance. Report adopted.

    Senator Marty from the Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security, to which was
referred
    S.F. No. 2359: A bill for an act relating to health; transferring the comprehensive advanced

Emergency Medical Services Regulatory Board general fund appropriation to the commissioner
of health for the purposes of sections 1 and 2. For fiscal year 2012, base level funding for the
comprehensive advanced life-support program shall be $......."
   Renumber the sections in sequence
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.
Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

    Senator Marty from the Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security, to which was

148.96, subdivision 3.

No more than two questions may be submitted at a mail election and no offices may be voted on.
Notice of the election must be given to the county auditor at least 53 days prior to the election.
This notice shall also fulfill the requirements of Minnesota Rules, part 8210.3000. The special mail
ballot procedures must be posted at least six weeks prior to the election. Not more than 30 nor later
than 14 days prior to the election, the auditor or clerk shall mail ballots by nonforwardable mail
to all voters registered in the county, municipality, or school district. No later than 14 days before
the election, the auditor or clerk must make a subsequent mailing of ballots to those voters who
register to vote after the initial mailing but before the 20th day before the election. Eligible voters
not registered at the time the ballots are mailed may apply for ballots pursuant to chapter 203B.
The auditor or clerk must appoint a ballot board to examine the return envelopes and mark them
"Accepted" or "Rejected" within three days of receipt if there are 14 or fewer days before election
day, or within five days of receipt if there are more than 14 days before election day. The board may
consist of staff trained as election judges. Election judges performing the duties in this section must

the voter with a replacement ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot. If the ballot is
rejected within five days of the election, the envelope must remain sealed and the official in charge
of the ballot board must attempt to contact the voter by telephone or e-mail to notify the voter that
the voter's ballot has been rejected. The official must document the attempts made to contact the
voter.
    If the ballot is accepted, the county auditor or municipal clerk must mark the roster to indicate
that the voter has already cast a ballot in that election. After the close of business on the fourth day
before the election, the ballots from return envelopes marked "Accepted" may be opened, duplicated
as needed in the manner provided by section 206.86, subdivision 5, initialed by the ballot board, and
deposited in the appropriate ballot box.
   In all other respects, the provisions of the Minnesota Election Law governing deposit and
counting of ballots apply.

    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 204C.28, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. County auditor. Every county auditor shall remain at the auditor's office to
receive delivery of the returns, to permit public inspection of the summary statements, and to tabulate
the votes until all have been tabulated and the results made known, or until 24 hours have elapsed
since the end of the hours for voting, whichever occurs first. Every county auditor shall, in the
presence of the municipal clerk or the election judges who deliver the returns, make a record of all
materials delivered, the time of delivery, and the names of the municipal clerk or election judges
who made delivery. The record must include the number of ballots delivered to the precinct, as
certified by section 204B.28, and the total number of ballots returned, as certified by the election
judges under section 204C.24. A discrepancy between the number of ballots delivered to the precinct
and the number of total ballots returned by election judges that cannot be reconciled by taking into
account the adjustments made by the election judge counts and any unofficial ballots must be noted,
but does not disqualify the votes from that precinct or invalidate the election. The county auditor
shall file the record and all envelopes containing ballots in a safe and secure place with envelope
seals unbroken. Access to the record and ballots shall be strictly controlled. Accountability and a
record of access shall be maintained by the county auditor during the period for contesting elections
or, if a contest is filed, until the contest has been finally determined. Thereafter, the record shall be
retained in the auditor's office for the same period as the ballots as provided in section 204B.40.
     The county auditor shall file all envelopes containing ballots in a safe place with seals unbroken.
If the envelopes were previously opened by proper authority for examination or recount, the county
auditor shall have the envelopes sealed again and signed by the individuals who made the inspection
or recount. The envelopes may be opened by the county canvassing board if necessary to procure
election returns that the election judges inadvertently may have sealed in the envelopes with the
ballots. In that case, the envelopes shall be sealed again and signed in the same manner as otherwise
provided in this subdivision.

a record of all materials delivered, the time of delivery, and the names of the election judges or
other individuals who made delivery. The record must include the number of ballots delivered to
the precinct, as certified by section 204B.28, and the total number of ballots returned, as certified by

   (a) The commissioner of management and budget must report annually to the legislature on the
7118                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [67TH DAY

degree to which entities receiving appropriations for capital projects in previous omnibus capital
improvement acts have encumbered or expended that money. The report must be submitted to
the chairs of the house of representatives Ways and Means Committee and the senate Finance
Committee by January 1 of each year.
    (b) The commissioner of management and budget must report by January 15 of each year to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the house of representatives and senate committees with
jurisdiction over capital investment, finance, and ways and means, on the amount and percentage
of each agency's capital appropriation that is used to pay for the costs of staff directly attributable
to capital programs or projects funded with state general obligation bond proceeds. The report must
also include information on agencies' compliance with the commissioner's policies governing the
use of general obligation bond proceeds to pay staff costs and any changes to the commissioner's
policies.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 16A.647, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Authority to issue. When authorized by law to issue state general obligation
bonds or state 911 revenue bonds under section 403.275, the commissioner may issue all or part of
the bonds as tax credit bonds or as interest subsidy bonds or a combination of the two.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 16A.647, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Sale; certain costs of issuance. Tax credit bonds and interest subsidy bonds must be
sold at a price not less than 98 percent of their stated principal amount. No state trunk highway bond
may be sold for a price of less than par and accrued interest. When the commissioner determines to
issue tax credit bonds or interest subsidy bonds to achieve a net present value debt service savings
over tax-exempt bonds, the commissioner may issue an additional principal amount of bonds, not
to exceed two percent of the principal amount of bonds otherwise authorized by law to be issued,
to pay the costs of investment banking and banking services related to the sale or placement of the
bonds, provided the additional issuance will not cause an increase in the general fund debt service
transfer for the biennium during which the bonds are sold, as estimated by the commissioner. The
proceeds are appropriated for this purpose.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16A.66, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Special provisions for sale and issuance. Refunding bonds may be sold publicly, or
directly to the State Board of Investment without bids, or may be exchanged for bonds refunded
by agreement with their holders. The refunding bonds must be prepared, executed, delivered, and
secured in the same way as the refunded bonds. The proceeds of refunding bonds may be deposited,
invested, and applied to accomplish the refunding as provided in section 475.67, subdivisions 5
to 10, and 13. Bids for the securities to be purchased for the escrow account may be secured, at
the commissioner's election, either through the State Board of Investment or a suitable financial
institution. The interest rate on refunding bonds may exceed that on the refunded bonds if the
purpose of refunding is to extend the maturities and to reduce the amount needed annually to pay
and to secure the debt.
  Sec. 33. [16B.327] RECYCLING CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION WASTE
FROM STATE BUILDINGS; REQUIREMENT.
67TH DAY]                       MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2010                                       7119

    The commissioner of administration shall require in contracts for the construction, renovation,

in a landfill and must recycle at least 50 percent of the nonhazardous construction and demolition
waste, measured by tonnage or volume, produced by the project or demonstrate that the waste was
delivered to construction and demolition waste recycling facilities that maintain a 50 percent annual
recycling rate. This requirement applies to state building construction, renovation, or demolition
projects receiving funding from the bond proceeds fund after January 1, 2010, meeting the following
requirements: (1) construction and renovation projects of $5,000,000 or more; and (2) all demolition

made until the agency that will use the project has presented the program plan and cost estimates
for all elements necessary to complete the project to the chair of the senate Finance Committee
and the chair of the house of representatives Ways and Means Committee and the chairs have
made their recommendations, and the chair of the house of representatives Capital Investment
Committee is notified. "Construction or major remodeling" means construction of a new building,
a substantial addition to an existing building, or a substantial change to the interior configuration
of an existing building. The presentation must note any significant changes in the work that will
be done, or in its cost, since the appropriation for the project was enacted or from the predesign
submittal. The program plans and estimates must be presented for review at least two weeks before
a recommendation is needed. The recommendations are advisory only. Failure or refusal to make
a recommendation is considered a negative recommendation. The chairs of the senate Finance
Committee and the house of representatives Capital Investment and Ways and Means Committees

project, or in its cost.

    Subd. 3. Grant program established. (a) The commissioner shall make competitive grants to
local governmental units to acquire and prepare land on which public infrastructure required to
support an eligible project will be located, including demolition of structures and remediation of
any hazardous conditions on the land, or to predesign, design, acquire, construct, furnish, and equip
public infrastructure required to support an eligible project. The local governmental unit receiving
a grant must provide for the remainder of the public infrastructure costs from other sources. The
commissioner may waive the requirements related to an eligible project under subdivision 2 if a
project would be eligible under this section but for the fact that its location requires infrastructure
improvements to residential development.
   (b) The amount of a grant may not exceed the lesser of the cost of the public infrastructure or
50 percent of the sum of the cost of the public infrastructure plus the cost of the completed eligible
project.
    (c) The purpose of the program is to keep or enhance jobs in the area, increase the tax base, or
to expand or create new economic development through the growth of new ­     b­o

businesses and organizations.
   Subd. 4. Application. (a) The commissioner must develop forms and procedures for soliciting
and reviewing applications for grants under this section. At a minimum, a local governmental unit
must include the following information in its application:
    (1) a resolution of its governing body certifying that the money required to be supplied by the
local governmental unit to complete the public infrastructure is available and committed;
    (2) a detailed estimate, along with necessary supporting evidence, of the total development costs
for the public infrastructure and eligible project;
    (3) an assessment of the potential or likely use of the site for ­b­o

    (5) a commitment from the governing body to repay the grant if the milestones are not realized
by the completion date identified in clause (4); and
     (6) any additional information or material the commissioner prescribes.
    (b) The determination of whether to make a grant under subdivision 3 is within the discretion
of the commissioner, subject to this section. The commissioner's decisions and application of the
priorities are not subject to judicial review, except for abuse of discretion.
    Subd. 5. Priorities. (a) If applications for grants exceed the available appropriations, grants
must be made for public infrastructure that, in the commissioner's judgment, provides the highest
return in public benefits for the public costs incurred. "Public benefits" include job creation,
environmental benefits to the state and region, efficient use of public transportation, efficient use
of existing infrastructure, provision of affordable housing, multiuse development that constitutes
community rebuilding rather than single-use development, crime reduction, blight reduction,
community stabilization, and property tax base maintenance or improvement. In making this
judgment, the commissioner shall give priority to eligible projects with one or more of the
following characteristics:
                                                                        b­o

                                                                                  c­
                                                                                   e innovative businesses;
   (2) proximity to public transit if located in a metropolitan county, as defined in section 473.121,
subdivision 4;
    (3) multijurisdictional eligible projects that take into account the need for affordable housing,
transportation, and environmental impact;
   (4) the eligible project is not relocating substantially the same operation from another location
in the state, unless the commissioner determines the eligible project cannot be reasonably
accommodated within the local governmental unit in which the business is currently located, or the
business would otherwise relocate to another state or country; and
     (5) the number of jobs that will be created.
   (b) The factors in paragraph (a) are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather, the commissioner
may weigh each factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner considers
appropriate.
    Subd. 6. Cancellation of grant. If a grant is awarded to a local governmental unit and funds are
not encumbered for the grant within four years after the award date, the grant must be canceled.
   Subd. 7. Repayment of grant. If an eligible project supported by public infrastructure funded
with a grant awarded under this section is not occupied by ­

accordance with the grant application under subdivision 4 within five years after the date of the last
grant payment, the grant recipient must repay the amount of the grant received. The commissioner
must deposit all money received under this subdivision into the state treasury and credit it to the
debt service account in the state bond fund.

(a) The commissioner of transportation shall develop rules, procedures for application for grants,
conditions of grant administration, standards, and criteria, including bridge specifications, in
cooperation with road authorities of political subdivisions, for use in the administration of funds
appropriated to the commissioner and for the administration of grants to subdivisions.
    (b) The maximum use of standardized bridges is encouraged. Regardless of the size of the
existing bridge, a bridge or replacement bridge is eligible for assistance from the state transportation
fund if a hydrological survey indicates that the bridge or replacement bridge must be ten feet or more
in length.
    (c) As part of the standards or rules, the commissioner shall, in consultation with local road
authorities, establish a minimum distance between any two bridges that cross over the same river,
stream, or waterway, so that only one of the bridges is eligible for a grant under this section. As
appropriate, the commissioner may establish exceptions from the minimum distance requirement
or procedures for obtaining a variance.
    (d) Funds appropriated to the commissioner from the Minnesota state transportation fund shall
be segregated from the highway tax user distribution fund and other funds created by article XIV
of the Constitution.

    (1) The facilities must be owned by the state or a political subdivision, but may be leased under
section 16A.695 to organizations that operate the programs. The commissioner must prescribe the
terms and conditions of the leases.

Education, licensed child care, and other early childhood intervention programs.
   (3) State appropriations must be matched on a 50 percent basis with nonstate funds. The
matching requirement must apply program wide and not to individual grants.

      Subd. 2. Grant priority. (a) The commissioner must give priority to:
   (1) projects in counties or municipalities with the highest percentage of children living in
poverty;
      (2) grants that involve collaboration among sponsors of programs under this section; and
   (3) where feasible, grants for programs that utilize Youthbuild under sections 116L.361 to
116L.366 for at least 25 percent of each grant awarded or $50,000 of the labor portion of the
construction, whichever is less, if:
   (i) the work is appropriate for Youthbuild, as mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the local
Youthbuild program, considering safety and skills needed;
    (ii) it is demonstrated by Youthbuild that using Youthbuild will not increase the overall cost of
the project; and
    (iii) eligible programs consult with appropriate labor organizations to deliver education and
training.
      (b) The commissioner may give priority to:
    (1) projects that collaborate with child care providers, including all-day and school-age child care
programs, special needs care, sick child care, nontraditional hour care, and programs that include
services to refugee and immigrant families; ­   an

    Subd. 2. Procedure; certain costs of issuance. (a) The commissioner may sell and issue the
bonds on the terms and conditions the commissioner determines to be in the best interests of the
