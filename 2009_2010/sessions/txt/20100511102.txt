The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 915, Chapter 322, a bill creating a statewide school
11036                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [102ND DAY

employee health insurance pool.
As I indicated in my letter to the conference committee dated March 24, the concerns expressed
in previous vetoed bills regarding this matter remain. The drivers of health care costs including
growing prescription drug costs, benefit plan design, utilization rates, high-tech procedures, and the
high cost of insuring retirees are again not addressed in this bill. Mandating participation impedes
local control for districts to address these cost drivers for their employee groups.
Supporters of this legislation have used parts of the local impact study prepared by Minnesota
Management and Budget based on a 2004 actuarial study that indicated the potential for savings.
However, the study also indicated the cost drivers cited above as well as other unknown factors that
could negate potential savings.
For years, the teachers' union has been the main advocate for various iterations of this bill, while
most education and other service organizations have remained adamantly opposed. I offered to more
favorably consider this bill if the teachers' union and legislators would pass bold reform initiatives
such as improving teacher effectiveness and preparedness, strengthening teacher evaluations,
alternative licensure programs, and tenure reform focused to improve student achievement. There
has been an unwillingness to agree to any of these reforms. In fact, the union has gone to great
lengths to impede reform.
Sadly, the union and its legislative allies are unwilling to improve educational opportunities for
children but instead seek to improve their own benefits. So, again, I veto this bill.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 915 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                       May 10, 2010
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 2226, Chapter 291.
This bill is unneeded because the current coercion statute (Minn. Stat. 609.27, Subd. 1) already
provides criminal penalties for the behavior this bill seeks to prohibit.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor

certified beds. A nursing facility may not discharge a resident in order to lay away a bed. Notice to
the commissioner shall be given 60 days prior to the effective date of the layaway. Beds on layaway
shall have the same status as voluntarily delicensed and decertified beds and shall not be subject to
license fees and license surcharge fees. In addition, beds on layaway may be removed from layaway
at any time on or after one year after the effective date of layaway in the facility of origin, with a
60-day notice to the commissioner. A nursing facility that removes beds from layaway may not
place beds on layaway status for one year after the effective date of the removal from layaway. The
commissioner may approve the immediate removal of beds from layaway if necessary to provide
access to those nursing home beds to residents relocated from other nursing homes due to emergency
situations or closure. In the event approval is granted, the one-year restriction on placing beds on
layaway after a removal of beds from layaway shall not apply. Beds may remain on layaway for
up to fi
       ­v­­
          e ten years. The commissioner may approve placing and removing beds on layaway at any
time during renovation or construction related to a moratorium project approved under this section
or section 144A.073. Nursing facilities are not required to comply with any licensure or certification
requirements for beds on layaway status.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 144A.161, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Scope. Where a facility is undertaking closure, curtailment, reduction, or change in
operations, or where a housing with services unit registered under chapter 144D is closed because
the space that it occupies is being replaced by a nursing facility bed that is being reactivated from
layaway status, the facility and the county social services agency must comply with the requirements
of this section.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245A.03, subdivision 7, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 7. Licensing moratorium. (a) The commissioner shall not issue an initial license for
child foster care licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 2960.3000 to 2960.3340, or adult foster care
licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265, under this chapter for a physical
location that will not be the primary residence of the license holder for the entire period of licensure.
If a license is issued during this moratorium, and the license holder changes the license holder's
primary residence away from the physical location of the foster care license, the commissioner shall
revoke the license according to section 245A.07. Exceptions to the moratorium include:
   (1) foster care settings that are required to be registered under chapter 144D;
    (2) foster care licenses replacing foster care licenses in existence on May 15, 2009, and
determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b);
    (3) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b)
for the closure of a nursing facility, ICF/MR, or regional treatment center;
    (4) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner under paragraph (b)
for persons requiring hospital level care; or
   (5) new foster care licenses determined to be needed by the commissioner for the transition of
people from personal care assistance to the home and community-based services.
    (b) The commissioner shall determine the need for newly licensed foster care homes as defined
under this subdivision. As part of the determination, the commissioner shall consider the availability
of foster care capacity in the area in which the licensee seeks to operate, and the recommendation
of the local county board. The determination by the commissioner must be final. A determination
of need is not required for a change in ownership at the same address.
    (c) Residential settings that would otherwise be subject to the moratorium established in
paragraph (a), that are in the process of receiving an adult or child foster care license as of July
1, 2009, shall be allowed to continue to complete the process of receiving an adult or child foster
care license. For this paragraph, all of the following conditions must be met to be considered in the
process of receiving an adult or child foster care license:
   (1) participants have made decisions to move into the residential setting, including
documentation in each participant's care plan;
   (2) the provider has purchased housing or has made a financial investment in the property;
    (3) the lead agency has approved the plans, including costs for the residential setting for each
individual;

   (4) the completion of the licensing process, including all necessary inspections, is the only
remaining component prior to being able to provide services; and
   (5) the needs of the individuals cannot be met within the existing capacity in that county.
To qualify for the process under this paragraph, the lead agency must submit documentation to the
commissioner by August 1, 2009, that all of the above criteria are met.
   (d) The commissioner shall study the effects of the license moratorium under this subdivision
and shall report back to the legislature by January 15, 2011. This study shall include, but is not
limited to the following:
   (1) the overall capacity and utilization of foster care beds where the physical location is not the
primary residence of the license holder prior to and after implementation of the moratorium;
   (2) the overall capacity and utilization of foster care beds where the physical location is the
primary residence of the license holder prior to and after implementation of the moratorium; and
   (3) the number of licensed and occupied ICF/MR beds prior to and after implementation of the
moratorium.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Permitted services by an individual who is related. Notwithstanding subdivision
2, paragraph (a), clause (1), and subdivision 7, an individual who is related to a person receiving
supported living services may provide licensed services to that person if:
   (1) the person who receives supported living services received these services in a residential site
on July 1, 2005;
    (2) the services under clause (1) were provided in a corporate foster care setting for adults and
were funded by the developmental disabilities home and community-based services waiver defined
in section 256B.092;
    (3) the individual who is related obtains and maintains both a license under chapter 245B and
an adult foster care license under Minnesota Rules, parts 9555.5105 to 9555.6265; and
    (4) the individual who is related is not the guardian of the person receiving supported living
services.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245A.11, subdivision 7b, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 7b. Adult foster care data privacy and security. (a) An adult foster care license holder
who creates, collects, records, maintains, stores, or discloses any individually identifiable recipient
data, whether in an electronic or any other format, must comply with the privacy and security
provisions of applicable privacy laws and regulations, including:
   (1) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public
Law 104-1; and the HIPAA Privacy Rule, Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part 160, and
subparts A and E of part 164; and

   (2) the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act as codified in chapter 13.
    (b) For purposes of licensure, the license holder shall be monitored for compliance with the
following data privacy and security provisions:
    (1) the license holder must control access to data on foster care recipients according to the
definitions of public and private data on individuals under section 13.02; classification of the data on
individuals as private under section 13.46, subdivision 2; and control over the collection, storage,
use, access, protection, and contracting related to data according to section 13.05, in which the

    (2) the license holder must provide each foster care recipient with a notice that meets the
requirements under section 13.04, in which the license holder is assigned the duties of the
government entity, and that meets the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, part
164.52. The notice shall describe the purpose for collection of the data, and to whom and why it
may be disclosed pursuant to law. The notice must inform the recipient that the license holder uses
electronic monitoring and, if applicable, that recording technology is used;
   (3) the license holder must not install monitoring cameras in bathrooms;
   (4) electronic monitoring cameras must not be concealed from the foster care recipients; and

requests that the recording be held longer based on a specific report of alleged maltreatment; or
(ii) the recording captures an incident or event of alleged maltreatment under section 626.556 or
626.557 or a crime under chapter 609. When requested by a recipient or when a recording captures an
incident or event of alleged maltreatment or a crime, the license holder must maintain the recording

make a copy of the recording. The investigating agency will maintain the electronic video or audio
recordings as required in section 626.557, subdivision 12b.
   (c) The commissioner shall develop, and make available to license holders and county licensing
workers, a checklist of the data privacy provisions to be monitored for purposes of licensure.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.0625, subdivision 19c, is amended
to read:
   Subd. 19c. Personal care. Medical assistance covers personal care assistance services provided
by an individual who is qualified to provide the services according to subdivision 19a and sections
256B.0651 to 256B.0656, provided in accordance with a plan, and supervised by a qualified

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.0651, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:
102ND DAY]                          TUESDAY, MAY 11, 2010                                       11045

    Subd. 17. Recipient protection. (a) Providers of home care services must provide each recipient
with a copy of the home care bill of rights under section 144A.44 at least 30 days prior to terminating
services to a recipient, if the termination results from provider sanctions under section 256B.064,
such as a payment withhold, a suspension of participation, or a termination of participation. If a
home care provider determines it is unable to continue providing services to a recipient, the provider
must notify the recipient, the recipient's responsible party, and the commissioner 30 days prior to
terminating services to the recipient because of an action under section 256B.064, and must assist
the commissioner and lead agency in supporting the recipient in transitioning to another home care
provider of the recipient's choice.
    (b) In the event of a payment withhold from a home care provider, a suspension of participation,
or a termination of participation of a home care provider under section 256B.064, the commissioner
may inform the Office of Ombudsman for Long-Term Care and the lead agencies for all recipients
with active service agreements with the provider. At the commissioner's request, the lead agencies
must contact recipients to ensure that the recipients are continuing to receive needed care, and that
the recipients have been given free choice of provider if they transfer to another home care provider.
In addition, the commissioner or the commissioner's delegate may directly notify recipients who
receive care from the provider that payments have been withheld or that the provider's participation
in medical assistance has been suspended or terminated, if the commissioner determines that
notification is necessary to protect the welfare of the recipients. For purposes of this subdivision,
"lead agencies" means counties, tribes, and managed care organizations.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.0652, subdivision 6, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 6. Authorization; personal care assistance and qualified professional. (a) All personal
care assistance services, supervision by a qualified professional, and additional services beyond the
limits established in subdivision 11, must be authorized by the commissioner or the commissioner's
designee before services begin except for the assessments established in subdivision 11 and section
256B.0911. The authorization for personal care assistance and qualified professional services under
section 256B.0659 must be completed within 30 days after receiving a complete request.
    (b) The amount of personal care assistance services authorized must be based on the
recipient's home care rating. The home care rating shall be determined by the commissioner or
the commissioner's designee based on information submitted to the commissioner identifying the
following:
   (1) total number of dependencies of activities of daily living as defined in section 256B.0659;

    (c) The methodology to determine total time for personal care assistance services for each home
care rating is based on the median paid units per day for each home care rating from fiscal year
2007 data for the personal care assistance program. Each home care rating has a base level of hours
assigned. Additional time is added through the assessment and identification of the following:
    (1) 30 additional minutes per day for a dependency in each critical activity of daily living as
defined in section 256B.0659;
11046                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [102ND DAY

   (2) 30 additional minutes per day for each complex health-related function as defined in section
256B.0659; and
   (3) 30 additional minutes per day for each behavior issue as defined in section 256B.0659,
subdivision 4, paragraph (d).
    (d) A limit of 96 units of qualified professional supervision may be authorized for each recipient
receiving personal care assistance services. A request to the commissioner to exceed this total in a
calendar year must be requested by the personal care provider agency on a form approved by the
commissioner.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.0659, subdivision 10, is amended
to read:
   Subd. 10. Responsible party; duties; delegation. (a) A responsible party shall enter into a
written agreement with a personal care assistance provider agency, on a form determined by the
commissioner, to perform the following duties:
    (1) be available while care is provided in a method agreed upon by the individual or the
individual's legal representative and documented in the recipient's personal care assistance care
plan;
    (2) monitor personal care assistance services to ensure the recipient's personal care assistance
care plan is being followed; and
    (3) review and sign personal care assistance time sheets after services are provided to provide
verification of the personal care assistance services.
Failure to provide the support required by the recipient must result in a referral to the county common
entry point.
      (b) Responsible parties who are parents of minors or guardians of minors or incapacitated
persons may delegate the responsibility to another adult who is not the personal care assistant
during a temporary absence of at least 24 hours but not more than six months. The person delegated
as a responsible party must be able to meet the definition of the responsible party. The responsible
party must ensure that the delegate performs the functions of the responsible party, is identified at
the time of the assessment, and is listed on the personal care assistance care plan. The responsible
party must communicate to the personal care assistance provider agency about the need for a

the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and have the necessary information to make
informed choices about home and community-based service options.
    (b) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to a nursing facility from a hospital must
be screened prior to admission as outlined in subdivisions 4a through 4c.
    (c) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to nursing facilities with only a telephone
screening must receive a face-to-face assessment from the long-term care consultation team member
of the county in which the facility is located or from the recipient's county case manager within 40
calendar days of admission.
    (d) Individuals under 65 years of age who are admitted to a nursing facility without preadmission
screening according to the exemption described in subdivision 4b, paragraph (a), clause (3), and who
remain in the facility longer than 30 days must receive a face-to-face assessment within 40 days of
admission.
  (e) At the face-to-face assessment, the long-term care consultation team member or county case
manager must perform the activities required under subdivision 3b.
    (f) For individuals under 21 years of age, a screening interview which recommends nursing
facility admission must be face-to-face and approved by the commissioner before the individual is
admitted to the nursing facility.
    (g) In the event that an individual under 65 years of age is admitted to a nursing facility on
an emergency basis, the county must be notified of the admission on the next working day, and a
face-to-face assessment as described in paragraph (c) must be conducted within 40 calendar days
of admission.
   (h) At the face-to-face assessment, the long-term care consultation team member or the

case manager must present information about home and community-based options, including
consumer-directed options, so the individual can make informed choices. If the individual chooses
home and community-based services, the long-term care consultation team member or case
manager must complete a written relocation plan within 20 working days of the visit. The plan
shall describe the services needed to move out of the facility and a time line for the move which is
designed to ensure a smooth transition to the individual's home and community.
    (i) An individual under 65 years of age residing in a nursing facility shall receive a face-to-face
assessment at least every 12 months to review the person's service choices and available alternatives
unless the individual indicates, in writing, that annual visits are not desired. In this case, the
individual must receive a face-to-face assessment at least once every 36 months for the same
purposes.
    (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 6, the commissioner may pay county agencies
directly for face-to-face assessments for individuals under 65 years of age who are being considered
for placement or residing in a nursing facility.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256D.44, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Special needs. In addition to the state standards of assistance established in subdivisions
1 to 4, payments are allowed for the following special needs of recipients of Minnesota supplemental
aid who are not residents of a nursing home, a regional treatment center, or a group residential
housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the
percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;
    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (8) lactose-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (9) antidumping diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan;
11056                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                        [102ND DAY

    (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
    (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding the language in this subdivision, an amount equal to the maximum
allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage, unless allowed under paragraph (g).
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, to access housing and services as provided in paragraph
(f), the recipient may choose housing that may ­      o­r­m ay

read:
    Subd. 18. Personal care assistance choice option; generally. (a) The commissioner may allow
a recipient of personal care assistance services to use a fiscal intermediary to assist the recipient in
paying and accounting for medically necessary covered personal care assistance services. Unless
otherwise provided in this section, all other statutory and regulatory provisions relating to personal
care assistance services apply to a recipient using the personal care assistance choice option.
    (b) Personal care assistance choice is an option of the personal care assistance program that
allows the recipient who receives personal care assistance services to be responsible for the hiring,
training, scheduling, and firing of personal care assistants according to the terms of the written
agreement with the personal care assistance choice agency required under subdivision 20, paragraph
(a). This program offers greater control and choice for the recipient in who provides the personal
care assistance service and when the service is scheduled. The recipient or the recipient's responsible
party must choose a personal care assistance choice provider agency as a fiscal intermediary. This
personal care assistance choice provider agency manages payroll, invoices the state, is responsible
for all payroll-related taxes and insurance, and is responsible for providing the consumer training
and support in managing the recipient's personal care assistance services.

except that a specific bridge may remain in continued service if the reasons are documented in the
report required under subdivision 5.
   (d) All bridge projects funded under this section in fiscal year 2012 or later must include bicycle
and pedestrian accommodations if both sides of the bridge are located in a city or the bridge links a

pedestrian infrastructure in close proximity to the bridge. All pedestrian facilities must meet or
exceed federal accessibility requirements as outlined in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
Act, codified in United States Code, title 42, chapter 126, subchapter II, and Section 504 of the

    Subd. 1a. Establishment of plate. The commissioner may only establish a special plate as
authorized under this chapter. This requirement does not apply to alternative or additional designs
for a special plate.
   Subd. 2. Submissions to commissioner. (a) A person, legal entity, or other requester, however
organized, that plans to seek legislation establishing a new special plate, or is a proponent of a new
special plate, shall submit the following information and fee to the commissioner:
    (1) The requester shall submit a request for the special plate being sought, describing the
p­
­ro
  ­p­o
     ­­
      s­
       ed
        ­ special plate in general terms, the purpose of the plate, and the proposed fee or minimum
contribution required for the plate.
    (2) The requester shall submit the results of a scientific sample survey of Minnesota motor
vehicle owners that indicates that at least 10,000 motor vehicle owners intend to purchase the
proposed plate with the proposed fee or minimum contribution. The requester's plan to undertake
the survey must be reported to the commissioner before the survey is undertaken. The survey must
be performed independently of the requester by another person or legal entity, however organized,
that conducts similar sample surveys in the normal course of business.
    (3) The requester shall submit an application fee of $20,000, to cover the cost of reviewing the
application for a new plate and developing the new special plate if authorized by law. State funds
may not be used to pay the application fee. This requirement does not apply if legislation or a bill
introduced to the legislature proposing the new special plate contains a mechanism by which all
costs incurred by the commissioner for development and implementation of the plate are covered,
provided that the application fee subsequently does apply if such a mechanism is not enacted in the
law authorizing the new special plate.
   (4) The requester shall submit a marketing strategy that contains (i) short-term and long-term
marketing plans for the requested plate, and (ii) a financial analysis showing the anticipated revenues
and the planned expenditures of any fee or contribution derived from the requested plate.
    (b) The requester shall submit the information required under paragraph (a) to the commissioner
at least 120 days before the convening of the next regular legislative session at which the requester
will submit the proposal.
   Subd. 2a. Information for legislature. (a) Within 15 days of the introduction of a bill proposing
a new special plate, the commissioner shall submit a briefing to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives and senate committees to which the bill was referred. At a
minimum, the briefing must:
   (1) summarize the requirements for a special plate under this section; and
   (2) identify which of the requirements have been met for the proposed special plate.
    (b) If a proposed special plate is a topic of discussion at a legislative committee hearing, the
commissioner shall make every reasonable effort to provide testimony. The testimony must include
the information required in the briefing under paragraph (a).
    (c) Notwithstanding section 3.195, the commissioner may submit the briefing under paragraph
(a) by submitting an electronic version rather than a printed version.

    Subd. 3. Design; redesign. (a) If the proposed ­ n­
                                                      ew­ special plate sought by the requester is
approved by law, the requester shall submit the proposed design for the plate to the commissioner
as soon as practicable, but not later than 120 days after the effective date of the law authorizing
issuance of the plate. The commissioner is responsible for selecting the final design for the special
plate.
    (b) The requester that originally requested a new special plate subsequently approved by law
may not submit a new design for the plate within the five years following the date of first issuance
of the plate unless the inventory of those plates has been exhausted. The requester may deplete the
remaining inventory of the plates by reimbursing the commissioner for the cost of the plates.
    Subd. 4. Refund of fee. If the special plate requested is not authorized in the legislative session
at which authorization was sought, the commissioner shall, if applicable, refund $17,500 of the
application fee to the requester.
    Subd. 5. Discontinuance of plate. (a) The commissioner shall discontinue the issuance or
renewal of any proximate special plate ­        au

deputy registrar for any statutory or home rule charter city as the public interest and convenience
may require, without regard to whether the county auditor of the county in which the city is situated
has been appointed as the deputy registrar for the county or has been discontinued as the deputy
registrar for the county, and without regard to whether the county in which the city is situated has
established a county license bureau that issues motor vehicle licenses as provided in section 373.32.
    (b) The commissioner may appoint, and for cause discontinue, a deputy registrar for any statutory
or home rule charter city as the public interest and convenience may require, if the auditor for the
county in which the city is situated chooses not to accept appointment as the deputy registrar for the
county or is discontinued as a deputy registrar, or if the county in which the city is situated has not
established a county license bureau that issues motor vehicle licenses as provided in section 373.32.
The individual appointed by the commissioner as a deputy registrar for any statutory or home rule
charter city must be a resident of the county in which the city is situated.
    (c) The commissioner may appoint, and for cause discontinue, the county auditor of each county
as a deputy registrar.
    (d) Despite any other provision, a person other than a county auditor or a director of a county
license bureau, who was appointed by the registrar before August 1, 1976, as a deputy registrar
for any statutory or home rule charter city, may continue to serve as deputy registrar and may be
discontinued for cause only by the commissioner. The county auditor who appointed the deputy
registrars is responsible for the acts of deputy registrars appointed by the auditor.
    (e) Each deputy, before entering upon the discharge of duties, shall take and subscribe an oath
to faithfully discharge the duties and to uphold the laws of the state.
    (f) If a deputy registrar appointed under this subdivision is not an officer or employee of a county
or statutory or home rule charter city, the deputy shall in addition give bond to the state in the sum
of $10,000, or a larger sum as may be required by the commissioner, conditioned upon the faithful
discharge of duties as deputy registrar.

      Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 174.24, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; application. Any legislatively established public transit commission or
authority, any county or statutory or home rule charter city providing financial assistance to or
operating public transit, any private operator of public transit, or any combination thereof is eligible
to receive financial assistance through the public transit participation program. Except as provided
in subdivision 2b for assistance provided from federal funds, eligible recipients must be located
outside of the metropolitan area.
      Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 174.24, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2b. Federal aid. (a) The commissioner may accept and disburse federal funds received and
appropriated under section 174.23, subdivision 1, as an additional source of funds for implementing
the public transit participation program established in this section. This authority includes, but is
not limited to:
    (1) adopting administrative rules to establish financial assistance allocation priorities, identify
factors to consider in reviewing an applicant's management plan, evaluate a request for financial
assistance, and determine the amount of financial assistance to be provided; and
    (2) establishing project selection criteria under the United States Code, title 49, section 5311,
state management plan as approved by the Federal Transit Administration, United States Department
of Transportation.
   (b) If the commissioner accepts and disburses federal funds as provided in paragraph (a), the
commissioner shall:
      (1) maintain separate accounts for (i) state sources of funds, and (ii) federal sources of funding;
and
   (2) ensure that all state sources of funds are only used for assistance to eligible recipients as
provided in subdivision 2.
      Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 174.24, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Operating assistance; recipient classifications. (a) The commissioner shall
determine the total operating cost of any public transit system receiving or applying for assistance
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To be eligible for financial assistance,
an applicant or recipient shall provide to the commissioner all financial records and other
information and shall permit any inspection reasonably necessary to determine total operating cost
and correspondingly the amount of assistance that may be paid to the applicant or recipient. Where
more than one county or municipality contributes assistance to the operation of a public transit
system, the commissioner shall identify one as lead agency for the purpose of receiving money
under this section.
   (b) Prior to distributing operating assistance to eligible recipients for any contract period, the
commissioner shall place all recipients into one of the following classifications: urbanized area

      ) (e) If a recipient informs the commissioner in writing after the establishment of these
percentages but prior to the distribution of financial assistance for any year that paying its
designated percentage of total operating cost from local sources will cause undue hardship, the
commissioner may reduce the percentage to be paid from local sources by the recipient and
increase the percentage to be paid from local sources by one or more other recipients inside or
outside the classification. However, the commissioner may not reduce or increase any recipient's
percentage under this paragraph for more than two years successively. If for any year the funds
appropriated to the commissioner to carry out the purposes of this section are insufficient to allow
the commissioner to pay the state share of total operating cost as provided in this paragraph, the
commissioner shall reduce the state share in each classification to the extent necessary.

those who, because of mental or physical disability, income status, or age are unable to transport
themselves and are dependent upon others for transportation services.
    Subd. 2. Duties of council. In order to accomplish the purposes in subdivision 1, the
council, following consultation with the legislative committees or divisions with jurisdiction over
transportation policy and budget, or with appropriate legislative transportation subcommittees,
shall adopt a biennial work plan that must incorporate the following activities:
    (1) compile information on existing transportation alternatives for the transit public, and serve as
a clearinghouse for information on services, funding sources, innovations, and coordination efforts;
    (2) identify best practices and strategies that have been successful in Minnesota and in other
states for coordination of local, regional, state, and federal funding and services;
   (3) recommend statewide objectives for providing public transportation services for the transit
public;
   (4) identify barriers prohibiting coordination and accessibility of public transportation services
and aggressively pursue the elimination of those barriers;
   (5) recommend policies and procedures for coordinating local, regional, state, and federal
funding and services for the transit public;
   (6) identify stakeholders in providing services for the transit public, and seek input from them
concerning barriers and appropriate strategies;
   (7) recommend guidelines for developing transportation coordination plans throughout the state;
   (8) encourage all state agencies participating in the council to purchase trips within the
coordinated system;
    (9) facilitate the creation and operation of transportation brokerages to match riders to
the appropriate service, promote shared dispatching, compile and disseminate information on
transportation options, and promote regional communication;
    (10) encourage volunteer driver programs and recommend legislation to address liability and
insurance issues;
   (11) recommend minimum performance standards for delivery of services;
   (12) identify methods to eliminate fraud and abuse in special transportation services;
    (13) develop a standard method for addressing liability insurance requirements for transportation
services purchased, provided, or coordinated;

   (14) design and develop a contracting template for providing coordinated transportation services;
   (15) recommend an interagency uniform contracting and billing and accounting system for
providing coordinated transportation services;
    (16) encourage the design and development of training programs for coordinated transportation
services;
   (17) encourage the use of public school transportation vehicles for the transit public;
   (18) develop an allocation methodology that equitably distributes transportation funds to
compensate units of government and all entities that provide coordinated transportation services;
   (19) identify policies and necessary legislation to facilitate vehicle sharing; and
    (20) advocate aggressively for eliminating barriers to coordination, implementing coordination
strategies, enacting necessary legislation, and appropriating resources to achieve the council's
objectives.

operation, and maintenance of roads in order to reasonably address the safety and accessibility needs
of users of all ages and abilities. Complete streets considers the needs of motorists, pedestrians,
transit users and vehicles, bicyclists, and commercial and emergency vehicles moving along and
across roads, intersections, and crossings in a manner that is sensitive to the local context and
recognizes that the needs vary in urban, suburban, and rural settings.
   Subd. 2. Implementation. The commissioner shall implement a complete streets policy after
consultation with stakeholders, state and regional agencies, local governments, and road authorities.
The commissioner, after such consultation, shall address relevant protocols, guidance, standards,
requirements, and training, and shall integrate related principles of context-sensitive solutions.
    Subd. 3. Report. Beginning in 2011, the commissioner shall report on the implementation of
the complete streets policy in the agency's biennial budget submission under section 174.02.
    Subd. 4. Local road authorities. Local road authorities are encouraged, but not required, to
create and adopt complete streets policies for their roads that reflect local context and goals. Nothing
in this section may be construed to prohibit a local road authority from adopting a complete streets
policy that incorporates or exceeds statutory complete streets principles.
    Subd. 5. Variances from engineering standards. (a) When evaluating a request for a variance
from the engineering standards for state-aid projects under chapter 162 in which the variance request
is related to complete streets, the commissioner shall consider the latest edition of:

offense, and one-third shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the Minnesota grade
crossing safety account or the state trunk highway fund as provided in this paragraph. When section
387.213 also is applicable to the fine, section 387.213 shall be applied before this paragraph is
applied. All costs of participation in a nationwide police communication system chargeable to the
state of Minnesota shall be paid from appropriations for that purpose.

the metropolitan area.
    (2) "Homestead property" means: (i) a single-family dwelling occupied by the owner, and the
surrounding land, not exceeding a total of ten acres; or (ii) a manufactured home, as defined in

     Sec. 62. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 473.411, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Use of public roadways and appurtenances. The council may use for the purposes
of sections 473.405 to 473.449 upon the conditions stated in this subdivision any state highway or
other public roadway, parkway, or lane, or any bridge or tunnel or other appurtenance of a roadway,
without payment of any compensation, provided the use does not interfere unreasonably with the
public use or maintenance of the roadway or appurtenance or entail any substantial additional costs
for maintenance. The provisions of this subdivision do not apply to the property of any common
carrier railroad or common carrier railroads. The consent of the public agency in charge of such
state highway or other public highway or roadway or appurtenance is not required; except that if the
council seeks to use a designated parkway for regular route service in the city of Minneapolis, it must
obtain permission from and is subject to reasonable limitations imposed by a joint board consisting
of two representatives from the council, two members of the board of park commissioners, and a

city of Minneapolis, it must obtain permission from and is subject to reasonable limitations imposed
by a joint board consisting of two representatives from the council, two members of the board of
park commissioners, and a fifth member jointly selected by other members of the board. The joint
board must include a nonvoting member appointed by the council of the city in which the parkway
is located.
   The board of park commissioners and the council may designate persons to sit on the joint
board. In considering a request by the council to use designated parkways for additional routes or

trips, the joint board consisting of the council or their designees, the board of park commissioners
or their designees, and the fifth member, shall base its decision to grant or deny the request based
on the criteria to be established by the joint board. The decision to grant or deny the request must
be made within 45 days of the date of the request. The park board must be notified immediately
by the council of any temporary route detours. If the park board objects to the temporary route
detours within five days of being notified, the joint board must convene and decide whether to grant
the request, otherwise the request is deemed granted. If the agency objects to the proposed use
or claims reimbursement from the council for additional cost of maintenance, it may commence
an action against the council in the district court of the county wherein the highway, roadway, or
appurtenance, or major portion thereof, is located. The proceedings in the action must conform to
the Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to the district courts. The court shall sit without jury. If the
court determines that the use in question interferes unreasonably with the public use or maintenance
of the roadway or appurtenance, it shall enjoin the use by the council. If the court determines that the
use in question does not interfere unreasonably with the public use or maintenance of the roadway
or appurtenance, but that it entails substantial additional maintenance costs, the court shall award
judgment to the agency for the amount of the additional costs. Otherwise the court shall award
judgment to the council. An aggrieved party may appeal from the judgment of the district court in
the same manner as is provided for such appeals in other civil actions. The council may also use
land within the right-of-way of any state highway or other public roadway for the erection of traffic
control devices, other signs, and passenger shelters upon the conditions stated in this subdivision
and subject only to the approval of the commissioner of transportation where required by statute,
and subject to the express provisions of other applicable statutes and to federal requirements where
necessary to qualify for federal aid.

on returns due for periods beginning in the subsequent calendar year, except for 90 percent of the
estimated June liability, which is due two business days before June 30. The remaining amount of
the June liability is due on August 20.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) or (c), a person prohibited by the person's religious beliefs
from paying electronically shall be allowed to remit the payment by mail. The filer must notify
the commissioner of revenue of the intent to pay by mail before doing so on a form prescribed by
the commissioner. No extra fee may be charged to a person making payment by mail under this
paragraph. The payment must be postmarked at least two business days before the due date for
making the payment in order to be considered paid on a timely basis.
    (e) Whenever the liability is $120,000 or more separately for: (1) the tax imposed under chapter
297A; (2) a fee that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes;
or (3) any other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A
taxes, then the payment of all the liabilities on the return must be accelerated as provided in this
subdivision.

in section 16A.152, subdivision 1, and the budget reserve account established in section 16A.152,
subdivision 1a, reach the amounts listed in section 16A.152, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), the
remittance of estimated sales tax collections by the 14th day of a month required under paragraph
(a), clause (2), shall be suspended. The commissioner of management and budget shall notify the
commissioner of revenue when the accounts have reached the required amounts. Beginning with
the suspension of paragraph (a), clause (2), for a vendor with a liability of $120,000 or more during
a fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, and fiscal years thereafter, the taxes imposed by chapter 297A
are due and payable to the commissioner on the 20th day of the month following the month in
which the taxable event occurred. Payments of tax liabilities for taxable events occurring in June
under paragraph (b) are not changed.

taxable event occurred, as an estimation of monthly sales tax liabilities, including the liability of
any fee or other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A
taxes, for the month in which the taxable event occurred, the vendor shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent of the amount of liability that was required to be paid by the 14th day of the month less the
amount remitted by the 14th day of the month. The penalty must not be imposed, however, if the
amount remitted by the 14th day of the month equals the lesser of: (1) 90 percent of the liability for
the month preceding the month in which the taxable event occurred; (2) 90 percent of the liability
for the same month in the previous calendar year as the month in which the taxable event occurred;
or (3) 90 percent of the average monthly liability for the previous calendar year.
