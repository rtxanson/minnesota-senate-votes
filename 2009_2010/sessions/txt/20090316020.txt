                               ­. An online learning provider must make available to the enrolling district
the course syllabus in a format established by the commissioner that identifies the state standards met
by the course, content outline, assessment requirements, expectations for actual teacher contact time,
other student-to-teacher communication, and academic support for supplemental online courses
taken by students in the enrolling district. Within 15 days after the online learning provider makes
information in this paragraph available to the enrolling district, the enrolling district must either
confirm or deny to the online provider that the student, parent or guardian, and enrolling district
have agreed the courses meet the enrolling district's graduation requirements. An online learning
course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation standard or grade progression requirements at
the enrolling district as demonstrated on the online provider's syllabus must be considered to meet
the corresponding graduation requirements of the student in the enrolling district. A student may
enroll in supplemental online learning courses up to the midpoint of the enrolling district's term.
The enrolling district may waive this requirement for special circumstances and upon acceptance
by the online provider.
   (c) An online learning provider must notify the commissioner that it is delivering online learning
and report the number of online learning students it is accepting and the online learning courses and
programs it is delivering.
    (d) An online learning provider may limit enrollment if the provider's school board or board of
directors adopts by resolution specific standards for accepting and rejecting students' applications.
  (e) An enrolling district may reduce an online learning student's regular classroom instructional
membership in proportion to the student's membership in online learning courses.
    (f) The online provider must report or make available individual student progress and credit
accumulation to the student, parent or guardian, and enrolling district in a manner specified by the
commissioner unless another manner is agreed upon by the enrolling district and the online provider
and submitted to the commissioner. The enrolling district must designate a contact person to assist
in the facilitation and monitoring of student progress and credit accumulation towards graduation
status.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.095, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Online learning parameters. (a) An online learning student must receive academic
credit for completing the requirements of an online learning course or program. Secondary
credits granted to an online learning student must be counted toward the graduation and credit
requirements of the enrolling district. A               ­­n­­o

The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online
learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students.
If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation
standard or grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement
is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or
courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03,
subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning student
in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online learning
provider that is not the enrolling district.

      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for payment of any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.
    (d) An enrolling district may offer online learning to its enrolled students. Such online learning
does not generate online learning funds under this section. An enrolling district that offers online
learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the reporting requirements or review criteria
under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district is a full-time online provider. A teacher with a
Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to enrolled students receiving online
learning from an enrolling district. The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts
with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The
instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota
license.

i­ providers are subject to the reporting requirements and review criteria under subdivision 7. A
teacher with a Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students.
The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and
receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum
developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants
a waiver, a teacher providing online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in
any one online learning course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply for enrollment to an approved full-time online learning program following
appropriate procedures in subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll
in classes at a local school per contract for instructional services between the online learning provider
and the school district.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.095, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
