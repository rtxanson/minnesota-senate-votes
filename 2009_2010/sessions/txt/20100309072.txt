provided in paragraph (d), the respondent shall be personally served forthwith a copy of the ex parte
order along with a copy of the petition and, if requested by the petitioner, notice of the date set for
the hearing. If the petitioner does not request a hearing, an order served on a respondent under this
subdivision must include a notice advising the respondent of the right to request a hearing, must be

a conspicuous notice that a hearing will not be held unless requested by the respondent within five
days of service of the order.
    (d) Service of the ex parte order may be made by published notice, as provided under subdivision
5, provided that the petitioner files the affidavit required under that subdivision. If personal service is
not made or the affidavit is not filed within 14 days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
If the petitioner does not request a hearing, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if
known, must be accompanied by the form for requesting a hearing and notice described in paragraph
(c). Unless personal service is completed, if service by published notice is not completed within 28

    Subd. 6. Mental health assessment and treatment. (a) When a person is convicted of a felony
offense under this section, or another felony offense arising out of a charge based on this section,
the court shall order an independent professional mental health assessment of the offender's need
for mental health treatment. The court may waive the assessment if an adequate assessment was
conducted prior to the conviction.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 13.384, 13.85, 144.291 to 144.298, 260B.171, or 260C.171, the
assessor has access to the following private or confidential data on the person if access is relevant

Data disclosed under this section may be used only for purposes of the assessment and may not be
further disclosed to any other person, except as authorized by law.
    (c) If the assessment indicates that the offender is in need of and amenable to mental health
treatment, the court shall include in the sentence a requirement that the offender undergo treatment.
    (d) The court shall order the offender to pay the costs of assessment under this subdivision unless
the offender is indigent under section 563.01.

      Sec. 11. [629.75] DOMESTIC ABUSE NO CONTACT ORDER.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; description. (a) A domestic abuse no contact order is an order
issued by a court against a defendant in a criminal proceeding or a juvenile offender in a delinquency
proceeding for:
7416                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [72ND DAY

   (1) domestic abuse as defined in section 518B.01, subdivision 2;
  (2) harassment or stalking under section 609.749 when committed against a family or household
member as defined in section 518B.01, subdivision 2;
   (3) violation of an order for protection under section 518B.01, subdivision 14; or
   (4) violation of a prior domestic abuse no contact order under this subdivision or section
518B.01, subdivision 22.
    (b) A domestic abuse no contact order may be issued as a pretrial order before final disposition
of the underlying criminal case or as a postconviction probationary order. A domestic abuse no
contact order is independent of any condition of pretrial release or probation imposed on the
defendant. A domestic abuse no contact order may be issued in addition to a similar restriction
imposed as a condition of pretrial release or probation. In the context of a postconviction
probationary order, a domestic abuse no contact order may be issued for an offense listed in
paragraph (a) or for a conviction for any offense arising out of the same set of circumstances as an
offense listed in paragraph (a).
   (c) A no contact order under this section shall be issued in a proceeding that is separate from but
held immediately following one in which any pretrial release or sentencing issues are decided.
    Subd. 2. Criminal penalties. (a) As used in this subdivision "qualified domestic violence-related
offense" has the meaning given in section 609.02, subdivision 16.
    (b) A person who knows of the existence of a domestic abuse no contact order issued against
the person and violates the order is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (c) A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor who knowingly violates this subdivision within
ten years of a previous qualified domestic violence-related offense conviction or adjudication of
delinquency. Upon a gross misdemeanor conviction under this paragraph, the defendant must
be sentenced to a minimum of ten days' imprisonment and must be ordered to participate in
counseling or other appropriate programs selected by the court as provided in section 518B.02.
Notwithstanding section 609.135, the court must impose and execute the minimum sentence
provided in this paragraph for gross misdemeanor convictions.
    (d) A person is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than
five years or to payment of a fine of not more than $10,000, or both, if the person knowingly
violates this subdivision: (1) within ten years of the first of two or more previous qualified domestic
violence-related offense convictions or adjudications of delinquency; or (2) while possessing a
dangerous weapon, as defined in section 609.02, subdivision 6. Upon a felony conviction under
this paragraph in which the court stays imposition or execution of sentence, the court shall impose
at least a 30-day period of incarceration as a condition of probation. The court also shall order
that the defendant participate in counseling or other appropriate programs selected by the court.
Notwithstanding section 609.135, the court must impose and execute the minimum sentence
provided in this paragraph for felony convictions.
    Subd. 3. Warrantless custodial arrest. A peace officer shall arrest without a warrant and take
into custody a person whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated a domestic
abuse no contact order, even if the violation of the order did not take place in the presence of the

    (f) If the person's driver's license or permit to drive has been revoked under section 169.792
or 169.797, the commissioner may only issue a limited license to the person after the person has
presented an insurance identification card, policy, or written statement indicating that the driver or
owner has insurance coverage satisfactory to the commissioner of public safety. The commissioner

who meets the requirements of this section and the program guidelines. The commissioner shall
not issue a license unless the program participant has provided satisfactory proof that a certified
ignition interlock device has been installed on the participant's motor vehicle at an installation
service center designated by the device's manufacturer. A license issued under authority of this
section must contain a restriction prohibiting the program participant from driving, operating, or
being in physical control of any motor vehicle not equipped with a functioning ignition interlock
device certified by the commissioner. A participant may drive an employer-owned vehicle not
equipped with an interlock device while in the normal course and scope of employment duties

section 169A.52, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (4), (5), or (6), or subdivision 4, paragraph
(a), clause (4), (5), or (6), or section 169A.54, subdivision 1, clause (4), (5), or (6), may apply for a
limited license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction, if the program participant is enrolled in
a licensed chemical dependency treatment or rehabilitation program as recommended in a chemical
use assessment, and if the participant meets the other applicable requirements of section 171.30.
After completing a licensed chemical dependency treatment or rehabilitation program and one year
of limited license use without violating the ignition interlock restriction, the conditions of limited
license use, or program guidelines, the participant may apply for conditional reinstatement of the
driver's license, subject to the ignition interlock restriction. If the program participant's ignition
interlock device subsequently registers a positive breath alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, the
commissioner shall cancel the driver's license, and the program participant may apply for another
limited license according to this paragraph.
    (d) Notwithstanding any statute or rule to the contrary, the commissioner has authority to
determine when a program participant is eligible for restoration of full driving privileges, except
that the commissioner shall not reinstate full driving privileges until the program participant has
met all applicable prerequisites for reinstatement under section 169A.55 and until the program
participant's device has registered no positive breath alcohol concentrations of 0.02 or higher
during the preceding 90 days.

the commissioner shall extend the person's revocation period under section 169A.52 or 169A.54
by:
   (1) 180 days for a first violation;
   (2) one year for a second violation; or
   (3) 545 days for a third and each subsequent violation.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the commissioner may terminate participation in the
program by any person when, in the commissioner's judgment, termination is necessary to the
interests of public safety and welfare. In the event of termination, the commissioner shall not
reduce the applicable revocation period under section 169A.52 or 169A.54 by the amount of time
during which the person possessed a limited or restricted driver's license issued under the authority
of subdivision 4.
   Subd. 6. Penalties; tampering. (a) A person who knowingly lends, rents, or leases a
motor vehicle that is not equipped with a functioning ignition interlock device certified by the
commissioner to a person with a license issued under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (b) A person who tampers with, circumvents, or bypasses the ignition interlock device, or assists
another to tamper with, circumvent, or bypass the device, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (c) The penalties of this subdivision do not apply if the action was taken for emergency purposes
or for mechanical repair, and the person limited to the use of an ignition interlock device does not
operate the motor vehicle while the device is disengaged.

    (b) A vehicle encumbered by a security interest perfected according to section 168A.17,
subdivision 2, or subject to a lease that has a term of 180 days or more, is subject to the interest of
the secured party or lessor unless the party or lessor had knowledge of or consented to the act upon
which the forfeiture is based. However, when the proceeds of the sale of a seized vehicle do not
equal or exceed the outstanding loan balance, the appropriate agency shall remit all proceeds of the
sale to the secured party after deducting the agency's costs for the seizure, tow, storage, forfeiture,
and sale of the vehicle. If the sale of the vehicle is conducted in a commercially reasonable manner
consistent with the provisions of section 336.9-610, the agency is not liable to the secured party
for any amount owed on the loan in excess of the sale proceeds. The validity and amount of a
nonperfected security interest must be established by its holder by clear and convincing evidence.
   (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the secured party's or lessor's interest in a vehicle is not
subject to forfeiture based solely on the secured party's or lessor's knowledge of the act or omission
upon which the forfeiture is based if the secured party or lessor demonstrates by clear and convincing
evidence that the party or lessor took reasonable steps to terminate use of the vehicle by the offender.

    (d) A motor vehicle is not subject to forfeiture under this section if its owner can demonstrate by
clear and convincing evidence that the owner did not have actual or constructive knowledge that the
vehicle would be used or operated in any manner contrary to law or that the owner took reasonable
steps to prevent use of the vehicle by the offender. If the offender is a family or household member of
the owner and has three or more prior impaired driving convictions, the owner is presumed to know
of any vehicle use by the offender that is contrary to law. "Vehicle use contrary to law" includes,
but is not limited to, violations of the following statutes:
    (1) section 171.24 (violations; driving without valid license);
    (2) section 169.791 (criminal penalty for failure to produce proof of insurance);
    (3) section 171.09 (driving restrictions; authority, violations);
    (4) section 169A.20 (driving while impaired);
    (5) section 169A.33 (underage drinking and driving); and
    (6) section 169A.35 (open bottle law).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to crimes committed
on or after that date.

forfeiture under this subdivision.
    (b) When a motor vehicle is seized under subdivision 2, or within a reasonable time after seizure,
the appropriate agency shall serve the driver or operator of the vehicle with a notice of the seizure
and intent to forfeit the vehicle. Additionally, when a motor vehicle is seized under subdivision 2, or
within a reasonable time after that, all persons known to have an ownership, possessory, or security
interest in the vehicle must be notified of the seizure and the intent to forfeit the vehicle. For those
vehicles required to be registered under chapter 168, the notification to a person known to have a
security interest in the vehicle is required only if the vehicle is registered under chapter 168 and
the interest is listed on the vehicle's title. Notice mailed by certified mail to the address shown in
Department of Public Safety records is sufficient notice to the registered owner of the vehicle. For
motor vehicles not required to be registered under chapter 168, notice mailed by certified mail to the
address shown in the applicable filing or registration for the vehicle is sufficient notice to a person
known to have an ownership, possessory, or security interest in the vehicle. Otherwise, notice may
be given in the manner provided by law for service of a summons in a civil action.
    (c) The notice must be in writing and contain:
    (1) a description of the vehicle seized;
    (2) the date of seizure; and
    (3) notice of the right to obtain judicial review of the forfeiture and of the procedure for obtaining
that judicial review, printed in English, Hmong, and Spanish. Substantially the following language

CONCILIATION COURT FILING FEE IF THE PROPERTY IS WORTH LESS THAN $500."
    (d) Within 30 days following service of a notice of seizure and forfeiture under this subdivision,
a claimant may file a demand for a judicial determination of the forfeiture. The demand must be in
the form of a civil complaint and must be filed with the court administrator in the county in which
the seizure occurred, together with proof of service of a copy of the complaint on the prosecuting
authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture and the appropriate agency that initiated the
forfeiture, including the standard filing fee for civil actions unless the petitioner has the right to
sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the value of the seized property is $7,500 or less,
the claimant may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of the seized vehicle. A copy of
the conciliation court statement of claim must be served personally or by mail on the prosecuting
authority having jurisdiction over the forfeiture, as well as on the appropriate agency that initiated
the forfeiture, within 30 days following service of the notice of seizure and forfeiture under this
subdivision. If the value of the seized property is less than $500, the claimant does not have to pay
the conciliation court filing fee.
    No responsive pleading is required of the prosecuting authority and no court fees may be charged
for the prosecuting authority's appearance in the matter. The prosecuting authority may appear for
the appropriate agency. Pleadings, filings, and methods of service are governed by the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
    (e) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
vehicle as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges
the vehicle was improperly seized, the claimant's interest in the vehicle seized, and any affirmative
defenses the claimant may have. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return
of a vehicle seized under this section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any person who
has been served with a notice of seizure and forfeiture unless the person has complied with this
subdivision.
    (f) If the claimant makes a timely demand for a judicial determination under this subdivision,
the forfeiture proceedings must be conducted as provided under subdivision 9.

    (c) The prosecuting authority may file an answer to a properly served demand for judicial
determination, including an affirmative counterclaim for forfeiture. The prosecuting authority is
not required to file an answer.
    (d) A judicial determination under this subdivision must not precede adjudication in the
criminal prosecution of the designated offense without the consent of the prosecuting authority.
The district court administrator shall schedule the hearing as soon as practicable after adjudication
in the criminal prosecution. The district court administrator shall establish procedures to ensure
efficient compliance with this subdivision. The hearing is to the court without a jury.
    (e) There is a presumption that a vehicle seized under this section is subject to forfeiture if the
prosecuting authority establishes that the vehicle was used in the commission of a designated offense

voters unless the voter is not eligible or is not registered to vote. List maintenance must include
procedures for eliminating duplicate names from the official list of eligible voters.
     The secretary of state shall also prepare a report to the county auditor containing the names of
all registrants whose status was changed to "inactive."
    Registrants whose status was changed to "inactive" must register in the manner specified in

   Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205.065, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2010,
chapter 184, section 26, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishing primary. A municipal primary for the purpose of nominating
elective officers may be held in any city on the second Tuesday in August of any year in which a
municipal general election is to be held for the purpose of electing officers. The date of a municipal
primary held in an odd-numbered year may be postponed for inclement weather as provided in
section 205.105."
   Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 205.07, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Date of election. The municipal general election in each city shall be held on the
first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in every even-numbered year. Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary and subject to the provisions of this section, the governing body of
a city may, by ordinance passed at a regular meeting held before June 1 of any year, elect to hold the

election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in each odd-numbered year. A city
may hold elections in either the even-numbered year or the odd-numbered year, but not both. When
a city changes its elections from one year to another, and does not provide for the expiration of
terms by ordinance, the term of an incumbent expiring at a time when no municipal election is held
in the months immediately prior to expiration is extended until the date for taking office following
the next scheduled municipal election. If the change results in having three council members to be
elected at a succeeding election, the two individuals receiving the highest vote shall serve for terms
of four years and the individual receiving the third highest number of votes shall serve for a term
of two years. To provide an orderly transition to the odd or even year election plan, the governing
body of the city may adopt supplementary ordinances regulating initial elections and officers to be
chosen at the elections and shortening or lengthening the terms of incumbents and those elected at
the initial election. The term of office for the mayor may be either two or four years. The term of
office of council members is four years. Whenever the time of the municipal election is changed,
the city clerk immediately shall notify in writing the county auditor and secretary of state of the
change of date. Thereafter the municipal general election shall be held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday in November in each odd-numbered or even-numbered year until the ordinance is
revoked and notification of the change is made. A municipal general election scheduled to be held
in an odd-numbered year may be postponed for inclement weather as provided in section 205.105.

in a city that is not held in conjunction with a state or federal election, and to town elections when
postponement of the town election is not subject to section 365.51.
    Subd. 2. Postponement of election. (a) In the event of severe or inclement weather, the
municipal clerk may postpone an election when the National Weather Service or a law enforcement
agency has issued storm warnings or travel advisories indicating that the weather conditions would
make travel to a polling place difficult or hazardous for voters and election judges. When one
or more jurisdictions are holding elections in conjunction with one another, the jurisdiction that
covers the largest geographic area has the authority, after consulting with the other auditors and
clerks, to make the decision to postpone all of the elections. A decision to postpone an election
must apply to every precinct in the jurisdiction.
    (b) A decision to postpone an election must be made no later than 6:00 p.m. on the day before
the election. The clerk must contact the election judges and notify local media outlets of the
postponement. The clerk must also post a notice on the jurisdiction's Web site, if practicable.
    (c) A postponed election must be rescheduled for the next following Tuesday after the election
was originally scheduled. The date on which the postponed election will be held shall be considered
the date of the election for purposes of absentee voting under chapter 203B. An election that is
postponed due to weather may be postponed again if necessary under this section."

the town board shall by resolution set another date for the meeting and election within 30 days of
the third Tuesday in March on which the meeting and election shall be held if bad weather forces
postponement of the meeting and election on the third Tuesday in March. The decision to postpone
the meeting and election must be made no later than three hours before the opening of the polling
place or the convening of the meeting, whichever comes first. The clerk shall notify the election
judges and local media offices of the decision to postpone the meeting and election. If the meeting
and election are postponed, the notice requirements in subdivision 2 shall apply to the postponed
meeting and election.
    The balloting of the town election must be concluded on the same day the election is commenced.
    (b) If any other political subdivision is conducting an election in conjunction with the township
election, postponement of the election shall be subject to section 205.105, 205A.055, or 373.50. If
an election is postponed under section 205.105, 205A.055, or 373.50, the town meeting shall also
be postponed as if postponed under this section.
    Sec. 72. [373.50] POSTPONEMENT OF ELECTION; INCLEMENT WEATHER.

in a county that is not held in conjunction with a state or federal election.
    Subd. 2. Postponement of election. (a) In the event of severe or inclement weather, the county
auditor may postpone an election when the National Weather Service or a law enforcement agency
has issued storm warnings or travel advisories indicating that the weather conditions would make
travel to a polling place difficult or hazardous for voters and election judges. When one or more
jurisdictions are holding elections in conjunction with one another, the jurisdiction that covers the
largest geographic area has the authority, after consulting with the other auditors and clerks, to make

the decision to postpone all of the elections. A decision to postpone an election must apply to every
precinct in the jurisdiction.
    (b) A decision to postpone an election must be made no later than 6:00 p.m. on the day before
the election. The auditor must contact the election judges and notify local media outlets of the
postponement. The auditor must also post a notice on the jurisdiction's Web site, if practicable.
    (c) A postponed election must be rescheduled for the next following Tuesday after the election
was originally scheduled. The date on which the postponed election will be held shall be considered
the date of the election for purposes of absentee voting under chapter 203B. An election that is
postponed due to weather may be postponed again if necessary under this section.

plumber's apprentice or registered unlicensed individual is authorized to assist in the installation of
plumbing only while under the direct supervision of a master, restricted master, journeyman, or
restricted journeyman plumber. The master, restricted master, journeyman, or restricted journeyman
plumber is responsible for ensuring that all plumbing work performed by the plumber's apprentice
or registered unlicensed individual complies with the plumbing code.
    Subd. 2. Journeyman exam. A plumber's apprentice or registered unlicensed individual who
has completed four years of practical plumbing experience is eligible to take the journeyman
plumbing examination. Up to 24 months of practical plumbing experience prior to becoming a
plumber's apprentice or registered unlicensed individual may be applied to the four-year experience
requirement. However, none of this practical plumbing experience may be applied if the individual
did not have any practical plumbing experience in the 12-month period immediately prior to
becoming a plumber's apprentice or registered unlicensed individual. The Plumbing Board may
adopt rules to evaluate whether the individual's past practical plumbing experience is applicable
in preparing for the journeyman's examination. If two years after completing the training the
individual has not taken the examination, the four years of experience shall be forfeited.
    The commissioner may allow an extension of the two-year period for taking the exam for cases
of hardship or other appropriate circumstances.
    Subd. 3. Registration, rules, applications, renewals, and fees. An unlicensed individual
may register by completing and submitting to the commissioner a registration form provided
by the commissioner. A completed registration form must state the date the individual began
training, the individual's age, schooling, previous experience, and employer, and other information
required by the commissioner. The board may prescribe rules, not inconsistent with this section,
for the registration of unlicensed individuals. Each applicant for initial registration as a ­
