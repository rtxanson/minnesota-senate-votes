The Honorable Tim Pawlenty
Governor, State of Minnesota
Dear Governor Pawlenty:
    I am exceedingly fortunate to have been offered an opportunity to work on a project that has been
close to my heart for more than a decade, a racino for Canterbury Park, now including Running Aces
also. Because I will need to devote myself full-time to this enterprise, I am announcing my intention
to step down from my state senate seat effective January 8, 2010.
    I am proud of my more than 30 years of public service and grateful for the support and confidence
that my constituents in Steele, Waseca and Rice Counties have shown me over the years. I believe
I will also serve them by playing a role in providing hundreds of millions of dollars to the state
from slot machines at these two venues, and fortify our state's struggling horse racing industry in
the process.
   I have enjoyed our relationship and wish you well in the upcoming legislative session.
   On a personal note, I want to add my thanks for being a good friend. I wish you the very best in
your future endeavors.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Dick Day
                                                     State Senator

                                                                                   January 27, 2010
