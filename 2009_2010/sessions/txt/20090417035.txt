surcharge and 50 percent of the fee required under paragraph (b) to reinstate the person's driver's
license, provided the person meets all other requirements of reinstatement. If a person chooses to
pay 50 percent of the total and an additional $25, the driver's license must expire after two years. The
person must pay an additional 50 percent less $25 of the total to extend the license for an additional
two years, provided the person is otherwise still eligible for the license. After this final payment
of the surcharge and fee, the license may be renewed on a standard schedule, as provided under
section 171.27. A handling charge may be imposed for each installment payment. Revenue from
the handling charge is credited to the driver services operating account in the special revenue fund
and is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any person making installment payments under paragraph (f), whose driver's license
subsequently expires, or is canceled, revoked, or suspended before payment of 100 percent of the

driver's license is subsequently reinstated. Upon payment of the outstanding balance due for the
initial reinstatement, the person may pay any new surcharge and fee imposed under paragraph (b)
in installment payments as provided under paragraph (f).

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 152.18, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Deferring prosecution for certain first time drug offenders. If any person
who has not previously participated in or completed a diversion program authorized under section
401.065 or who has not previously been placed on probation without a judgment of guilty and
thereafter been discharged from probation under this section is found guilty of a violation of
section 152.024, subdivision 2, 152.025, subdivision 2, or 152.027, subdivision 2, 3, or 4, for
possession of a controlled substance, after trial or upon a plea of guilty, and the court determines
that the violation does not qualify as a subsequent controlled substance conviction under section
152.01, subdivision 16a, the court m ­­ay
                                        ­ shall, without entering a judgment of guilty and with the
consent of the person, either (1) defer further proceedings and place the person on probation
upon such reasonable conditions as it may require and for a period, not to exceed the maximum
sentence provided for the violation.­­T

                                                t or (2) enter a written finding that states substantial
and compelling reasons why a deferral is inappropriate. For any other person who is found guilty
of a violation of section 152.024, subdivision 2; 152.025, subdivision 2; or 152.027, subdivision 2,
3, or 4, for possession of a controlled substance, after trial or upon a plea of guilty, and the court
determines that the violation does not qualify as a subsequent controlled substance conviction
under section 152.01, subdivision 16a, the court may, without entering a judgment of guilty and
with the consent of the person, defer further proceedings and place the person on probation upon
such reasonable conditions as it may require and for a period not to exceed the maximum sentence
provided for the violation. If the court grants a deferral, it may give the person the opportunity to
attend and participate in an appropriate program of education regarding the nature and effects of
alcohol and drug abuse as a stipulation of probation. Upon violation of a condition of the probation,
the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. The court may, in
its discretion, dismiss the proceedings against the person and discharge the person from probation
before the expiration of the maximum period prescribed for the person's probation. If during the
period of probation the person does not violate any of the conditions of the probation, then upon
expiration of the period the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against
that person. Discharge and dismissal under this subdivision shall be without court adjudication
of guilt, but a not public record of it shall be retained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension
for the purpose of use by the courts in determining the merits of subsequent proceedings against
the person. The not public record may also be opened only upon court order for purposes of a
criminal investigation, prosecution, or sentencing. Upon request by law enforcement, prosecution,
or corrections authorities, the bureau shall notify the requesting party of the existence of the not
public record and the right to seek a court order to open it pursuant to this section. The court shall
forward a record of any discharge and dismissal under this subdivision to the bureau which shall
make and maintain the not public record of it as provided under this subdivision. The discharge or
dismissal shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed
by law upon conviction of a crime or for any other purpose.
      For purposes of this subdivision, "not public" has the meaning given in section 13.02, subdivision
8a.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009, and applies to crimes committed
on or after that date.

been released from prison the commissioner shall place the person on conditional release for five
years. The commissioner shall impose any conditions of release that the commissioner deems
appropriate including, but not limited to, successful completion of an intensive probation program
as described in section 169A.74 (pilot programs of intensive probation for repeat DWI offenders).
If the person fails to comply with any condition of release, the commissioner may revoke the
person's conditional release and order the person to serve all or part of the remaining portion
of the conditional release term in prison. The commissioner may not dismiss the person from
supervision before the conditional release term expires. Except as otherwise provided in this
section, conditional release is governed by provisions relating to supervised release. The failure
of a court to direct the commissioner of corrections to place the person on conditional release, as
required in this paragraph, does not affect the applicability of the conditional release provisions to
the person.

this subdivision to pay as much of the costs of the supervision as possible. The commissioner shall
develop appropriate standards for this.

   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 469.175, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Annual financial reporting. (a) The state auditor shall develop a uniform system of
accounting and financial reporting for tax increment financing districts. The system of accounting
and financial reporting shall, as nearly as possible:
                                                               ­­

account funded with tax increments from other districts or with other public money;
   (4) be consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (b) The authority must annually submit to the state auditor a financial report in compliance with
paragraph (a). Copies of the report must also be provided to the county auditor and to the governing
body of the municipality, if the authority is not the municipality. To the extent necessary to permit
compliance with the requirement of financial reporting, the county and any other appropriate local
government unit or private entity must provide the necessary records or information to the authority
or the state auditor as provided by the system of accounting and financial reporting developed
pursuant to paragraph (a). The authority must submit the annual report for a year on or before August
1 of the next year.
   (c) The annual financial report must also include the following items:
   (1) the original net tax capacity of the district and any subdistrict under section 469.177,
subdivision 1;
   (2) the net tax capacity for the reporting period of the district and any subdistrict;
   (3) the captured net tax capacity of the district;
   (4) any fiscal disparity deduction from the captured net tax capacity under section 469.177,
subdivision 3;
   (5) the captured net tax capacity retained for tax increment financing under section 469.177,
subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (1);
   (6) any captured net tax capacity distributed among affected taxing districts under section
469.177, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (2);
   (7) the type of district;
