    (b) Within 30 days of receiving an application for certification under this subdivision, the

    (d) Investments in the fund may consist of equity investments or notes that pay interest or other

    (e) In order for a qualified investment in a qualified small business to be eligible for tax credits,
a qualified fund that makes the investment must have applied for and received certification for the
calendar year prior to making the qualified investment.
    Subd. 5. Credit allowed. (a) A qualified investor or qualified fund is eligible for a credit equal
to 25 percent of the qualified investment in a qualified small business. Investments made by a
pass-through entity qualify for a credit only if the entity is a qualified fund. The commissioner must
not allocate more than $10,000,000 in credits to qualified taxpayers or qualified funds for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2016. Any portion of a taxable
year's credits that is not allocated by the commissioner does not cancel and may be carried forward
to subsequent taxable years until all credits have been allocated.
    (b) The commissioner may not allocate more than a total maximum amount in credits for
a taxable year to a qualified investor for the investor's cumulative qualified investments as an
individual qualified investor and as an investor in a qualified fund; for married couples filing
joint returns the maximum is $250,000, and for all other filers the maximum is $125,000. The
commissioner may not allocate more than a total of $1,000,000 in credits over all taxable years for
qualified investments in any one qualified small business.
    (c) The commissioner may not allocate a credit to a qualified investor either as an individual
qualified investor or as an investor in a qualified fund if the investor receives more than 50 percent
of the investor's gross annual income from the qualified small business in which the qualified
investment is proposed. A member of the family of an individual disqualified by this paragraph is
not eligible for a credit under this section. For a married couple filing a joint return, the limitations
in this paragraph apply collectively to the investor and spouse. For purposes of determining the
ownership interest of an investor under this paragraph, the rules under section 267(c) and 267(e) of
the Internal Revenue Code apply.
   (d) Applications for tax credits for 2010 must be made available on the department's Web site by
9028                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [81ST DAY

September 1, 2010, and the department must begin accepting applications by September 1, 2010.
Applications for subsequent years must be made available by November 1 of the preceding year.
    (e) Qualified investors and qualified funds must apply to the commissioner for tax credits. Tax
credits must be allocated to qualified investors or qualified funds in the order that the tax credit
request applications are filed with the department. The commissioner must approve or reject tax
credit request applications within 15 days of receiving the application. The investment specified in
the application must be made within 60 days of the allocation of the credits. If the investment is not
made within 60 days, the credit allocation is canceled and available for reallocation. A qualified
investor or qualified fund that fails to invest as specified in the application, within 60 days of
allocation of the credits, must notify the commissioner of the failure to invest within five business
days of the expiration of the 60-day investment period.
    (f) All tax credit request applications filed with the department on the same day must be treated
as having been filed contemporaneously. If two or more qualified investors or qualified funds file
tax credit request applications on the same day, and the aggregate amount of credit allocation claims
exceeds the aggregate limit of credits under this section or the lesser amount of credits that remain
unallocated on that day, then the credits must be allocated among the qualified investors or qualified
funds who filed on that day on a pro rata basis with respect to the amounts claimed. The pro rata
allocation for any one qualified investor or qualified fund is the product obtained by multiplying
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the credit allocation claim filed on behalf of a
qualified investor and the denominator of which is the total of all credit allocation claims filed on
behalf of all applicants on that day, by the amount of credits that remain unallocated on that day for
the taxable year.
    (g) A qualified investor or qualified fund, or a qualified small business acting on their behalf,
must notify the commissioner when an investment for which credits were allocated has been made,
and the taxable year in which the investment was made. A qualified fund must also provide the
commissioner with a statement indicating the amount invested by each investor in the qualified
fund based on each investor's share of the assets of the qualified fund at the time of the qualified
investment. After receiving notification that the investment was made, the commissioner must issue
credit certificates for the taxable year in which the investment was made to the qualified investor or,
for an investment made by a qualified fund, to each qualified investor who is an investor in the fund.
The certificate must state that the credit is subject to revocation if the qualified investor or qualified
fund does not hold the investment in the qualified small business for at least three years, consisting
of the calendar year in which the investment was made and the two following years. The three-year
holding period does not apply if:
    (1) the investment by the qualified investor or qualified fund becomes worthless before the end
of the three-year period;
    (2) 80 percent or more of the assets of the qualified small business is sold before the end of the
three-year period;
   (3) the qualified small business is sold before the end of the three-year period; or
   (4) the qualified small business's common stock begins trading on a public exchange before the
end of the three-year period.
   (h) The commissioner must notify the commissioner of revenue of credit certificates issued under
81ST DAY]                           FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 2010                                       9029

this section.
    Subd. 6. Annual reports. (a) By February 1 of each year each qualified small business that
received an investment that qualified for a credit, and each qualified investor and qualified fund that
made an investment that qualified for a credit, must submit an annual report to the commissioner
and pay a filing fee of $100 as required under this subdivision. Each qualified investor and qualified
fund must submit reports for three years following each year in which it made an investment that
qualified for a credit, and each qualified small business must submit reports for five years following
the year in which it received an investment qualifying for a credit. Reports must be made in the
form required by the commissioner. All filing fees collected are deposited in the small business
investment tax credit administration account in the special revenue fund.
   (b) A report from a qualified small business must certify that the business satisfies the following
requirements:
   (1) the business has its headquarters in Minnesota;

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 297I.20, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3. Historic structure rehabilitation credit. An insurance company may claim a
credit against the premiums tax imposed under this chapter equal to the amount of the credit
certificate issued to it, or to a person who has assigned the credit to the insurance company, under
section 290.0681. If the amount of the credit exceeds the liability for tax under this chapter, the
commissioner shall refund the excess to the insurance company. An amount sufficient to pay the
refunds under this section is appropriated to the commissioner from the general fund. This credit
does not affect the calculation of police and fire aid under section 69.021.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2009, for certified historic structures for which qualified costs of rehabilitation are first paid under
construction contracts entered into after May 1, 2010.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 298.227, is amended to read:
   298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    (a) An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production
and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives
of the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that
producer. The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each
local employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the
employee committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees.
The review must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal
for expenditure of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be
released only for workforce development and associated public facility improvement, or for
acquisition of plant and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or for research
and development in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology,
but only if the producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at
least 50 percent of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with distributions in

2002. Effective for proposals for expenditures of money from the fund beginning May 26, 2007,
the commissioner may not release the funds before the next scheduled meeting of the board. If a
proposed expenditure is not approved by at least seven Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation
Board members, the funds must be deposited in the Taconite Environmental Protection Fund under
sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a producer uses money which has been released from the fund prior
to May 26, 2007 to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and the producer
removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134 within
ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a portion of the money granted from
the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development fund. The portion of the money
to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed from the taconite tax relief
area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund, declining by ten percent for each
of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains within the taconite tax relief
area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the facility had ceased, any money
remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to the purchaser of the facility on the
terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this section. If a producer fails to provide
matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months after the commissioner approves
release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another producer in proportion to the
distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any portion of the fund which is not
released by the commissioner within one year of its deposit in the fund shall be divided between
the taconite environmental protection fund created in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson
economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292 for placement in their respective special
accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds shall be distributed to the taconite environmental
protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund.
    (b)(i) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a), setting the amount of distributions
and the review process, an amount equal to ten cents per taxable ton of production in 2007, for
distribution in 2008 only, that would otherwise be distributed under paragraph (a), may be used

the producer is not required. The granting of the loan or grant is subject to approval by at least
seven Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board members;          ญ. If the money is provided as a loan,
interest must be payable on the loan at the rate prescribed in section 298.2213, subdivision 3. (ii)
Repayments of the loan and interest, if any, must be deposited in the taconite environment protection
fund under sections 298.222 to 298.225. If a loan or grant is not made under this paragraph by

Money distributed in 2008 to the fund established under this section that exceeds ten cents per ton
is available to qualifying producers under paragraph (a) on a pro rata basis.
    (c) Repayment or transfer of money to the taconite environmental protection fund under
paragraph (b), item (ii), must be allocated by the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board
for public works projects in house legislative districts in the same proportion as taxable tonnage of
production in 2007 in each house legislative district, for distribution in 2008, bears to total taxable
tonnage of production in 2007, for distribution in 2008. Notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, expenditures under this paragraph do not require approval by the governor. For purposes
of this paragraph, "house legislative districts" means the legislative districts in existence on May
15, 2009.

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 298.28, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. School districts. (a) 23.15 cents per taxable ton, plus the increase provided in
paragraph (d), less the amount that would have been computed under Minnesota Statutes 2008,
section 126C.21, subdivision 4, for the current year for that district, must be allocated to qualifying
school districts to be distributed, based upon the certification of the commissioner of revenue,
under paragraphs (b), (c), and (f).
   (b) (i) 3.43 cents per taxable ton must be distributed to the school districts in which the lands from
which taconite was mined or quarried were located or within which the concentrate was produced.
The distribution must be based on the apportionment formula prescribed in subdivision 2.
   (ii) Four cents per taxable ton from each taconite facility must be distributed to each affected
school district for deposit in a fund dedicated to building maintenance and repairs, as follows:
   (1) proceeds from Keewatin Taconite or its successor are distributed to Independent School
Districts Nos. 316, Coleraine, and 319, Nashwauk-Keewatin, or their successor districts;
   (2) proceeds from the Hibbing Taconite Company or its successor are distributed to Independent
School Districts Nos. 695, Chisholm, and 701, Hibbing, or their successor districts;
   (3) proceeds from the Mittal Steel Company and Minntac or their successors are distributed to
Independent School Districts Nos. 712, Mountain Iron-Buhl, 706, Virginia, 2711, Mesabi East, and
2154, Eveleth-Gilbert, or their successor districts;
   (4) proceeds from the Northshore Mining Company or its successor are distributed to
Independent School Districts Nos. 2142, St. Louis County, and 381, Lake Superior, or their
successor districts; and
   (5) proceeds from United Taconite or its successor are distributed to Independent School
Districts Nos. 2142, St. Louis County, and 2154, Eveleth-Gilbert, or their successor districts.
   Revenues that are required to be distributed to more than one district shall be apportioned
according to the number of pupil units identified in section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the
second previous year.
    (c)(i) 15.72 cents per taxable ton, less any amount distributed under paragraph (e), shall be
distributed to a group of school districts comprised of those school districts which qualify as a tax
relief area under section 273.134, paragraph (b), or in which there is a qualifying municipality as
defined by section 273.134, paragraph (a), in direct proportion to school district indexes as follows:
for each school district, its pupil units determined under section 126C.05 for the prior school year
shall be multiplied by the ratio of the average adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit for school
districts receiving aid under this clause as calculated pursuant to chapters 122A, 126C, and 127A

company that the authority determines is necessary to make construction of a development that

    (b) The authority may undertake actions under the authority of this subdivision only after

equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:
    (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that meets the requirement for a qualified low-income
building, as that term is used in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; and
9056                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [81ST DAY

    (2) not exceed the qualified basis of the housing, as defined under section 42(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, less the amount of any credit allowed under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
and
   (3) be used to:
   (i) acquire and prepare the site of the housing;
   (ii) acquire, construct, or rehabilitate the housing; or
   (iii) make public improvements directly related to the housing; or
     (4) be used to develop housing that does not exceed 150 percent of the average market value
of single-family homes in that municipality and to pay the cost of site acquisition, relocation,
demolition of existing structures, site preparation, and pollution abatement on one or more parcels,
if the parcel:
    (i) contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that has been vacant for
three or more months;
   (ii) contains a residence containing one to four family dwelling units that is structurally
substandard, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision 10;
    (iii) is in foreclosure as defined in section 325N.10, subdivision 7, but without regard to whether
the residence is the owner's principal residence; or
   (iv) is a vacant site, if the authority uses the parcel in connection with the development or
redevelopment of a parcel qualifying under items (i) to (iii).
    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined in
section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax increment
derived from such a district may be expended outside of the district but within the zone only
for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support the
activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section 469.176,
subdivision 4j. These expenditures are considered as expenditures for activities within the district.
   (f) The authority under paragraph (d), clause (4), expires on December 31, 2015. Increments
may continue to be expended under this authority after that date, if they are used to pay bonds or
binding contracts that would qualify under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), if December 31, 2015, is
considered to be the last date of the five-year period after certification under that provision.
