project to study and evaluate all state expenditures, regardless of source, that serve the primary
function of supporting the care, health, safety, stability, growth, development, and education of
children in this state. For purposes of this section, "children" includes individuals under 21 years of
age.

higher education institutions and from individuals with relevant experience at nonprofit institutions
and foundations.

including prenatal services for pregnant women and child care programs, grouped in a manner
that would assist the legislature in determining whether there are overlapping programs that lead
to duplication within the state, gaps in service delivery, and any administrative inefficiencies

organizations, the performance measures in place to assess the use of the money, and the intended
outcomes of the programs and services, to the extent this information is available.

provide a description of the experience gained from the pilot project, including any necessary draft
legislation regarding possible updates and enhancements to the evaluation of the money used to
support children in the state.

assistance to the commissioner for the purposes of this section.

committees and budget divisions with jurisdiction over children, family security, education, health,
human services, housing, public safety, corrections, and the judiciary by providing an electronic
version of the executive summary included in the report required by this subdivision. The report

units may determine that a person is an officer or employee if the person receives income from the
governmental subdivisions without regard to the manner of election or appointment, including but

defined in any levy or expenditure limitation; provided at least 50 percent of the cost of benefits on
dependents must be contributed by the employee or be paid by levies within existing charter tax
limitations.
   The word "dependents" as used in this subdivision means spouse and minor unmarried children
under the age of 18 years actually dependent upon the employee.
