    (c) No application for a deferred annuity may be made more than 60 days before the time the
former employee reaches the required age for entitlement to the payment of the annuity. The deferred
annuity begins to accrue no earlier than 60 days before the date the application is filed in the office of
the system, but not (1) before the date on which the employee reaches the required age for entitlement
to the annuity nor (2) before the day following the termination of state service in a position which
is not covered by the retirement system.
   (d) Application for the accumulated contributions left on deposit with the fund may be made at
any time following the date of the termination of service.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.72, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Entitlement to annuity. (a) Any person who has been an employee covered by
a retirement system listed in paragraph (b) is entitled when qualified to an annuity from each fund if
total allowable service in all funds or in any two of these funds totals three or more years if employed
before July 1, 2010, or totals five or more years if employed after June 30, 2010.
    (b) This section applies to the Minnesota State Retirement System, the Public Employees
Retirement Association including the Public Employees Retirement Association police and
fire fund, the Teachers Retirement Association, the State Patrol Retirement Association, or any
other public employee retirement system in the state with a similar provision, except as noted in
paragraph (c).
   (c) This section does not apply to other funds providing benefits for police officers or firefighters.
    (d) No portion of the allowable service upon which the retirement annuity from one fund is
based shall be again used in the computation for benefits from another fund. No refund may have
been taken from any one of these funds since service entitling the employee to coverage under the
system or the employee's membership in any of the associations last terminated. The annuity from
each fund must be determined by the appropriate provisions of the law except that the requirement

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 352.72, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Computation of deferred annuity. (a) The deferred annuity, if any, accruing under
subdivision 1, or section 352.22, subdivision 3, must be computed as provided in section 352.22,
subdivision 3, on the basis of allowable service before termination of state service and augmented
as provided herein. The required reserves applicable to a deferred annuity or to an annuity for which
a former employee was eligible but had not applied or to any deferred segment of an annuity must
be determined as of the date the benefit begins to accrue and augmented by interest compounded
annually from the first day of the month following the month in which the employee ceased to
be a state employee, or July 1, 1971, whichever is later, to the first day of the month in which the
annuity begins to accrue. The rates of interest used for this purpose must be five percent compounded
annually until January 1, 1981, and three percent compounded annually thereafter until January 1
of the year following the year in which the former employee attains age 55 or until January 1, 2012,
whichever is earlier, and from ­ht­­

compounded annually until January 1, 2012, if the employee becomes an employee after June 30,
2006, and two percent compounded annually after December 31, 2011, irrespective of when the
employee became a state employee. If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service,
the required reserves related to each period must be augmented by interest under this subdivision.
The sum of the augmented required reserves so determined is the present value of the annuity.

"Uninterrupted service" for the purpose of this subdivision means periods of covered employment
during which the employee has not been separated from state service for more than two years. If a
person repays a refund, the service restored by the repayment must be considered continuous with the
next period of service for which the employee has credit with this system. The formula percentages
used for each period of uninterrupted service must be those applicable to a new employee. The
mortality table and interest assumption used to compute the annuity must be those in effect when the
employee files application for annuity. This section does not reduce the annuity otherwise payable
under this chapter.
    (b) The retirement annuity or disability benefit of, or the survivor benefit payable on behalf
of, a former state employee who terminated service before July 1, 1997, which is not first payable
until after June 30, 1997, must be increased on an actuarial equivalent basis to reflect the change
in the postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, from
five percent to six percent under a calculation procedure and the tables adopted by the board and
approved by the actuary retained under section 356.214.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 352.75, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Existing deferred retirees. Any former member of the former Metropolitan Transit
Commission-Transit Operating Division employees retirement fund is entitled to a retirement
annuity from the Minnesota State Retirement System if the employee:
    (1) is not an active employee of the Transit Operating Division of the former Metropolitan
Transit Commission on July 1, 1978; (2) has at least ten years of active continuous service with the
Transit Operating Division of the former Metropolitan Transit Commission as defined by the former
Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit Operating Division employees retirement plan document
in effect on December 31, 1977; (3) has not received a refund of contributions; (4) has not retired
or begun receiving an annuity or benefit from the former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund; (5) is at least 55 years old; and (6) submits a valid
application for a retirement annuity to the executive director of the Minnesota State Retirement
System.
    The person is entitled to a retirement annuity in an amount equal to the normal old age
retirement allowance calculated under the former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document in effect on December 31, 1977,
subject to an early retirement reduction or adjustment in amount on account of retirement before
the normal retirement age specified in that former Metropolitan Transit Commission-Transit
Operating Division employees retirement fund plan document.
    The deferred retirement annuity of any person to whom this subdivision applies must be
augmented. The required reserves applicable to the deferred retirement annuity, determined as
of the date the allowance begins to accrue using an appropriate mortality table and an interest
assumption of five percent, must be augmented by interest at the rate of five percent per year
compounded annually from January 1, 1978, to January 1, 1981, ­         an
                                                                         ­d­ three percent per year
compounded annually from January 1, 1981, until the date that the annuity begins to accrue or
January 1, 2012, whichever is earlier, and two percent after December 31, 2011, to the first day
of the month in which the annuity begins to accrue. After the commencement of the retirement
annuity, the annuity is eligible for postretirement adjustments under section 356.415. On applying

    (2) greater than 1.99 percent and less than 4.01 percent, the incremental increase may be up to
0.5 percent for the employee and matching employer contribution rates; or
   (3) greater than four percent, the incremental increase may be up to 0.75 percent for the employee
and matching employer contribution.
    (e) Any recommended adjustment to the contribution rates must be reported to the chair and
the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement by January 15
following receipt of the most recent annual actuarial valuation prepared under section 356.215. If the
Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement does not recommend against the rate change
or does not recommend a modification in the rate change, the recommended adjustment becomes
effective on the first day of the first full payroll period in the fiscal year following receipt of the most
recent actuarial valuation that gave rise to the adjustment.
    (f) A contribution sufficiency of up to one percent of covered payroll must be held in reserve to
be used to offset any future actuarially required contributions that are more than the total combined
employee and employer contributions under subdivisions 2, 3, and 3a.
    (g) Before any reduction in contributions to eliminate a sufficiency in excess of one percent of
covered pay may be recommended, the executive director must review any need for a change in
actuarial assumptions, as recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214 in the most
recent experience study of the general employees retirement plan prepared under section 356.215
and the standards for actuarial work promulgated by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement that may result in an increase in the actuarially required contribution and must report
to the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement any recommendation by the board to
use the sufficiency exceeding one percent of covered payroll to offset the impact of an actuarial
assumption change recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision 1, and
reviewed by the actuary retained by the commission under section 356.214, subdivision 4.

    (h) No contribution sufficiency in excess of one percent of covered pay may be proposed to be
used to increase benefits, and no benefit increase may be proposed that would initiate an automatic
adjustment to increase contributions under this subdivision. Any proposed benefit improvement
must include a recommendation, prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision
1, and reviewed by the actuary retained by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
as provided under section 356.214, subdivision 4, on how the benefit modification will be funded.

who is vested under section 353.01, subdivision 47, dies, but did not qualify for retirement on the
date of death, the surviving spouse may elect to receive a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity
computed using section 353.30, subdivision 1c or 5, as applicable, except that the early retirement
reduction specified in the applicable subdivision will be applied to age 55 and one-half of the early
retirement reduction from age 55 back to the age payment begins.
    (d) Notwithstanding the definition of surviving spouse in section 353.01, subdivision 20, a
former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the monthly surviving spouse
optional annuity if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the
association. If there is no surviving spouse or child or children, a former spouse may be entitled to
a lump-sum refund payment under subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution decree,
but not a monthly surviving spouse optional annuity, despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (e) The surviving spouse eligible for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (a) may apply
for the annuity at any time after the date on which the deceased employee would have attained the
required age for retirement based on the employee's allowable service. The surviving spouse eligible
for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (b) or (c) may apply for an annuity any time after the
member's death.
   (f) Sections 353.34, subdivision 3, and 353.71, subdivision 2, apply to a deferred annuity or
surviving spouse benefit payable under this subdivision.
   (g) An amount equal to any excess of the accumulated contributions that were credited to the
account of the deceased employee over and above the total of the annuities paid and payable to the
surviving spouse must be paid to the surviving spouse's estate.
    (h) A member may specify in writing, with the signed consent of the spouse, that this subdivision
does not apply and that payment may be made only to the designated beneficiary as otherwise
provided by this chapter. The waiver of a surviving spouse annuity under this section does not make
a dependent child eligible for benefits under subdivision 1c.
    (i) If the deceased member or former member first became a public employee or a member of a
public pension plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, on or after July 1, 1989, a survivor annuity
computed under paragraph (a) or (c) must be computed as specified in section 353.30, subdivision
5, except for the revised early retirement reduction specified in paragraph (c), if paragraph (c) is the
applicable provision.

    (j) For any survivor annuity determined under this subdivision, the payment is to be based on
the total allowable service that the member had accrued as of the date of death and the age of the
member and surviving spouse on that date.

either who is vested under section 353.01, subdivision 47, or who has credit for at least 30 years of
allowable service, regardless of age attained, dies before the annuity or disability benefit becomes
payable, notwithstanding any designation of beneficiary to the contrary, the surviving spouse may

refund payment under section 353.32, subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution
decree but not a death while eligible survivor benefit despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (c) The benefit may be elected instead of a refund with interest under section 353.32, subdivision
1, or surviving spouse benefits otherwise payable under subdivisions 1 and 2. The benefit must be an
annuity equal to the 100 percent joint and survivor annuity which the member could have qualified
for on the date of death, computed as provided in sections 353.651, subdivisions 2 and 3, and 353.30,
subdivision 3.
    (d) The surviving spouse may apply for the annuity at any time after the date on which the
deceased employee would have attained the required age for retirement based on the employee's
allowable service. Sections 353.34, subdivision 3, and 353.71, subdivision 2, apply to a deferred
annuity payable under this subdivision.
     (e) No payment accrues beyond the end of the month in which entitlement to such annuity has
terminated. An amount equal to the excess, if any, of the accumulated contributions which were
credited to the account of the deceased employee over and above the total of the annuities paid and
payable to the surviving spouse must be paid to the deceased member's last designated beneficiary
or, if none, to the legal representative of the estate of such deceased member.
   (f) Any member may request in writing, with the signed consent of the spouse, that this
subdivision not apply and that payment be made only to the designated beneficiary, as otherwise
provided by this chapter.
    (g) For a member who is employed as a full-time firefighter by the Department of Military
Affairs of the state of Minnesota, allowable service as a full-time state Military Affairs Department
firefighter credited by the Minnesota State Retirement System may be used in meeting the minimum
allowable service requirement of this subdivision.

    (d) After June 30, 2015, if a contribution rate revision is made under subdivisions 4a, 4b, and
4c, the employer contributions under paragraphs (a) and (b) must be adjusted accordingly.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 50. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Determination. (a) For purposes of this section, a contribution sufficiency exists if
the total of the employee contributions, the employer contributions, and any additional employer
contributions, if applicable, exceeds the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses,
and the amortization contribution of the retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial
valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the approved actuary retained under section 356.214
and prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a contribution deficiency exists if the total of the employee
contributions, the employer contributions, and any additional employer contributions are less than
the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses, and the amortization contribution of the
retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation of the retirement plan prepared by
the approved actuary retained under section 356.214 and prepared under section 356.215 and the
standards for actuarial work of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4b. Contribution rate revision. Notwithstanding the contribution rate provisions under
subdivisions 2 and 3, the employee and employer contribution rates may be adjusted as follows:
    (1) if, after June 30, 2015, the regular actuarial valuation of the plan under section 356.215
indicates that there is a contribution sufficiency under subdivision 4a equal to or greater than one
percent of covered payroll and the sufficiency has existed for at least two consecutive years, the
employee and employer contribution rates for the plan may each be decreased to a level such that
the sufficiency equals no more than one percent of covered payroll based on the most recent actuarial
valuation; or
    (2) if, after June 30, 2015, the regular valuation of the plan under section 356.215 indicates that
there is a deficiency equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of covered payroll and the deficiency has
existed for at least two consecutive years, the employee and employer contribution rates for the
applicable plan may each be increased by:
   (i) 0.25 percent if the deficiency is less than 2.00 percent of covered payroll;
    (ii) 0.5 percent if the deficiency is equal to or greater than 2.00 percent of covered payroll and
less than or equal to four percent; and
   (iii) 0.75 percent if the deficiency is greater than four percent.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

   Subd. 4c. Contribution sufficiency measures. (a) A contribution sufficiency of up to one
percent of covered payroll must be held in reserve to be used to offset any future actuarially
required contributions that are more than the total combined employee and employer contributions
being collected.
    (b) Before any reduction in contributions to eliminate a sufficiency in excess of one percent
of covered pay may be recommended, the executive director must review any need for a change
in actuarial assumptions, as recommended by the actuary retained under section 356.214 in the
most recent experience study of the retirement plan, that may result in an increase in the actuarially
required contribution and must report to the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement
any recommendation by the board to use the sufficiency exceeding one percent of covered payroll
to offset the impact of an actuarial assumption change recommended by the actuary retained under
section 356.214, subdivision 1, and reviewed by the actuary retained by the commission under
section 356.214, subdivision 4.
    (c) A contribution sufficiency in excess of one percent of covered pay must not be used to
increase benefits, and a benefit increase must not be proposed that would initiate an automatic
adjustment under this section to increase contributions. A proposed benefit improvement must
include a recommendation, prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214, subdivision 1,
and reviewed by the actuary retained by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement,
as provided under section 356.214, subdivision 4, on the manner in which the benefit modification
is to be funded.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354.42, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4d. Reporting; commission review. A contribution rate increase or decrease under
subdivision 4b, as determined by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association,
must be reported to the chair and the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions
and Retirement on or before the next February 1 and, if the Legislative Commission on Pensions
and Retirement does not recommend against the rate change or does not recommend a modification
in the rate change, is effective on the next July 1 following the determination by the executive
director that a contribution deficiency or sufficiency exists based on the most recent actuarial
valuation under section 356.215.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 354.47, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Death before retirement. (a) If a member dies before retirement and is covered
under section 354.44, subdivision 2, and neither an optional annuity, nor a reversionary annuity, nor
a benefit under section 354.46, subdivision 1, is payable to the survivors if the member was a basic
member, then the surviving spouse, or if there is no surviving spouse, the designated beneficiary
is entitled to an amount equal to the member's accumulated deductions with interest credited to
the account of the member to the date of death of the member. If the designated beneficiary is a
minor, interest must be credited to the date the beneficiary reaches legal age, or the date of receipt,
whichever is earlier.
   (b) If a member dies before retirement and is covered under section 354.44, subdivision 6, and

subdivision 6, who ceases to render teaching service, may leave the person's accumulated deductions
in the fund for the purpose of receiving a deferred annuity at retirement.

    (b) The amount of the deferred retirement annuity is determined by section 354.44, subdivision
6, and augmented as provided in this subdivision. The required reserves for the annuity which
had accrued when the member ceased to render teaching service must be augmented, as further
specified in this subdivision, by the applicable interest rate compounded annually from the first day
of the month following the month during which the member ceased to render teaching service to
the effective date of retirement.
   (c) No augmentation is not creditable if the deferral period is less than three months or if deferral
commenced before July 1, 1971.
   (d) For persons who became covered employees before July 1, 2006, with a deferral period
commencing after June 30, 1971, the annuity must be augmented u

30, 2012, whichever is earlier; and
    (4) two percent interest compounded annually after June 30, 2012.
    (e) For persons who become covered employees after June 30, 2006, the interest rate used to
augment the deferred annuity is 2.5 percent interest compounded annually until June 30, 2012, or
until the effective date of retirement, whichever is earlier, and two percent interest compounded
annually after June 30, 2012.
    (f) If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service, a separate average salary
determined under section 354.44, subdivision 6, must be used for each period and the required
reserves related to each period must be augmented as specified in this subdivision. The sum of the
augmented required reserves is the present value of the annuity. For the purposes of this subdivision,
"period of uninterrupted service" means a period of covered teaching service during which the
member has not been separated from active service for more than one fiscal year.
   (g) If a person repays a refund, the service restored by the repayment must be considered as
continuous with the next period of service for which the person has allowable service credit in the
Teachers Retirement Association.
    (h) If a person does not render teaching service in any one fiscal year or more consecutive
fiscal years and then resumes teaching service, the formula percentages used from the date of the
resumption of teaching service must be those applicable to new members.
    (i) The mortality table and interest rate actuarial assumption used to compute the annuity must
be the applicable mortality table established by the board under section 354.07, subdivision 1, and
the interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215 in effect when the member retires.
   (j) In no case may the annuity payable under this subdivision be less than the amount of annuity
payable under section 354.44, subdivision 6.

in section 354.44, subdivision 6, also apply to an employee fulfilling the requirements with a
combination of service as provided in section 354.60.
   (l) The augmentation provided by this subdivision applies to the benefit provided in section
354.46, subdivision 2.
   (m) The augmentation provided by this subdivision does not apply to any period in which a
person is on an approved leave of absence from an employer unit covered by the provisions of this
chapter.
    (n) The retirement annuity or disability benefit of, or the survivor benefit payable on behalf
of, a former teacher who terminated service before July 1, 1997, which is not first payable until
after June 30, 1997, must be increased on an actuarial equivalent basis to reflect the change in
the postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, from five
percent to six percent under a calculation procedure and tables adopted by the board as recommended
by an approved actuary and approved by the actuary retained under section 356.214.

    (a) For purposes of computing postretirement adjustments after the effective date of this section
for eligible benefit recipients of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the funding ratio
of the plan, as determined by dividing the market value of assets by the actuarial accrued liability
as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.214 and 356.215,
determines the postretirement increase as follows:
                       Funding Ratio                                                    Postretirement Increase

90 percent as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.214 and
356.215, this subdivision expires and subsequent postretirement increases must be paid as specified
under subdivision 7.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 62. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.27, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 7. Calculation of postretirement adjustments. (a) This subdivision applies if
subdivision 6 has expired.
    (b) A percentage adjustment must be computed and paid under this subdivision to eligible
persons under subdivision 5. This adjustment is determined by reference to the Consumer Price
Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination
of annual cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance. For calculations of cost-of-living adjustments under paragraph (c), the term "average
third quarter Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided
by 3.
   (c) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
cost-of-living adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the same
average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting quotient,
and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
one percent.
    (d) The amount calculated under paragraph (c) is the full cost-of-living adjustment to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred
during the calendar year before the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, the full increase amount
must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar
year prior to the January 1 on which the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, calculated to the third
decimal place.
   (e) The adjustment must not be less than zero nor greater than five percent.
    (f) If the funding ratio of the plan as determined in the most recent actuarial valuation using
the actuarial value of assets is less than 80 percent there will be no postretirement adjustment the
following January 1.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 63. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.31, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Age and service requirements. Any coordinated member or former coordinated
member of the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association who has ceased to render teaching
service for the school district in which the teachers retirement fund association exists and who has
either attained the age of at least 55 years with not less than three years of allowable service credit
or received credit for not less than 30 years of allowable service regardless of age, shall be entitled
upon written application to a retirement annuity. Any coordinated member or former coordinated

member of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund Association who has ceased to render teaching
service for the school district in which the teacher retirement fund association exists and who has
either attained the age of at least 55 years with not less than three years of allowable service credit if
the member became an employee before July 1, 2010, or not less than five years of allowable service
credit if the member became an employee after June 30, 2010, or received service credit for not less
than 30 years of allowable service regardless of age, shall be entitled upon written application to a
retirement annuity.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.35, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Death before retirement; refund. If a coordinated member or former
coordinated member dies prior to retirement or prior to the receipt of any retirement annuity or
other benefit payment which is or may be payable and a surviving spouse optional annuity is not
payable pursuant to subdivision 2, a refund shall be paid to the person's surviving spouse, or if there
is none, to the person's designated beneficiary, or if there is none, to the legal representative of the
person's estate. For a coordinated member or former coordinated member of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, the refund shall be in an amount equal to the person's accumulated
employee contributions plus interest at the rate of six percent per annum compounded annually.
For a coordinated member or former coordinated member of the Duluth Teachers Retirement
Fund Association, the refund shall be in an amount equal to the person's accumulated employee
contributions plus interest at the rate of six percent per annum compounded annually to July 1,
2010, and four percent per annum compounded annually thereafter.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 65. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 354A.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility for deferred retirement annuity. (a) Any coordinated member who ceases
to render teaching services for the school district in which the teachers retirement fund association is
located, with sufficient allowable service credit to meet the minimum service requirements specified
in section 354A.31, subdivision 1, shall be entitled to a deferred retirement annuity in lieu of a
refund pursuant to subdivision 1. The deferred retirement annuity shall be computed pursuant to
section 354A.31 and shall be augmented as provided in this subdivision. The deferred annuity shall
commence upon application after the person on deferred status attains at least the minimum age
specified in section 354A.31, subdivision 1.
    (b) The monthly annuity amount that had accrued when the member ceased to render teaching
service must be augmented from the first day of the month following the month during which
the member ceased to render teaching service to the effective date of retirement. There is no
augmentation if this period is less than three months. For a member of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, the rate of augmentation is three percent compounded annually
until January 1 of the year following the year in which the former member attains age 55, and five
percent compounded annually after that date to the effective date of retirement if the employee
became an employee before July 1, 2006, and at 2.5 percent compounded annually if the employee
becomes an employee after June 30, 2006. For a member of the Duluth Teachers Retirement Fund
Association, the rate of augmentation is three percent compounded annually until January 1 of
the year following the year in which the former member attains age 55, five percent compounded
annually after that date to July 1, 2012, and two percent compounded annually after that date to the
11188                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [103RD DAY

effective date of retirement if the employee became an employee before July 1, 2006, and at 2.5
percent compounded annually to July 1, 2012, and two percent compounded annually after that
date to the effective date of retirement if the employee becomes an employee after June 30, 2006.
If a person has more than one period of uninterrupted service, a separate average salary determined
under section 354A.31 must be used for each period, and the monthly annuity amount related to
each period must be augmented as provided in this subdivision. The sum of the augmented monthly
annuity amounts determines the total deferred annuity payable. If a person repays a refund, the
service restored by the repayment must be considered as continuous with the next period of service
for which the person has credit with the fund. If a person does not render teaching services in any
one fiscal year or more consecutive fiscal years and then resumes teaching service, the formula
percentages used from the date of resumption of teaching service are those applicable to new
members. The mortality table and interest assumption used to compute the annuity are the table
established by the fund to compute other annuities, and the interest assumption under section
356.215 in effect when the member retires. A period of uninterrupted service for the purpose of
this subdivision means a period of covered teaching service during which the member has not been
separated from active service for more than one fiscal year.
    (c) The augmentation provided by this subdivision applies to the benefit provided in section
354A.35, subdivision 2. The augmentation provided by this subdivision does not apply to any period
in which a person is on an approved leave of absence from an employer unit.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.

   (d) After July 1, 2010, the assumptions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) continue to apply,
unless a different salary assumption or a different payroll increase assumption:
   (1) has been proposed by the governing board of the applicable retirement plan;
   (2) is accompanied by the concurring recommendation of the actuary retained under section
356.214, subdivision 1, if applicable, or by the approved actuary preparing the most recent actuarial
valuation report if section 356.214 does not apply; and
   (3) has been approved or deemed approved under subdivision 18.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 69. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 356.215, subdivision 11, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must contain an exhibit for financial reporting
purposes indicating the additional annual contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability and must contain an exhibit for contribution determination purposes indicating
the additional contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For the
retirement plans listed in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), the additional contribution must be calculated
on a level percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full funding in effect when
the valuation is prepared, assuming annual payroll growth at the applicable percentage rate set forth
in subdivision 8, paragraph (c). For all other retirement plans, the additional annual contribution
must be calculated on a level annual dollar amount basis.
    (b) For any retirement plan other than the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the general
employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, the general state
employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System, and the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association, if there has not been a change in the actuarial assumptions used
for calculating the actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing
annuities and benefits payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in
calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the
three, which change or changes by itself or by themselves without inclusion of any other items of
increase or decrease produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund,
the established date for full funding is the first actuarial valuation date occurring after June 1, 2020.

    (c) For any retirement plan other than the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund and the
general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association, if there has
been a change in any or all of the actuarial assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued
liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the
fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all
or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the three, and the change or changes, by itself or by
themselves and without inclusion of any other items of increase or decrease, produce a net increase
in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the fund, the established date for full funding must be
determined using the following procedure:
   (i) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with the
plan provisions governing annuities and retirement benefits and the actuarial assumptions in effect
before an applicable change;
    (ii) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed
to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined under item (i) by the
established date for full funding in effect before the change must be calculated using the interest
assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;
    (iii) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with
any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
   (d) For the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the established date for full funding is
June 30, 2020.

    (j) For the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the established date for full funding
is June 30 of the 25th year from the valuation date. In addition to other requirements of this chapter,
the annual actuarial valuation shall contain an exhibit indicating the funded ratio and the deficiency
or sufficiency in annual contributions when comparing liabilities to the market value of the assets
of the fund as of the close of the most recent fiscal year.
    (k) For the general state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System,
the established date for full funding is June 30, 2040.
   (l) For the retirement plans for which the annual actuarial valuation indicates an excess of
valuation assets over the actuarial accrued liability, the valuation assets in excess of the actuarial
accrued liability must be recognized as a reduction in the current contribution requirements by
an amount equal to the amortization of the excess expressed as a level percentage of pay over a
30-year period beginning anew with each annual actuarial valuation of the plan.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 70. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 356.30, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility; computation of annuity. (a) Notwithstanding any provisions of

qualifications of paragraph (b) may elect to receive a retirement annuity from each enumerated
retirement plan in which the person has at least one-half year of allowable service, based on the
allowable service in each plan, subject to the provisions of paragraph (c).
    (b) A person may receive, upon retirement, a retirement annuity from each enumerated
retirement plan in which the person has at least one-half year of allowable service, and augmentation
of a deferred annuity calculated at the appropriate rate under the laws governing each public
pension plan or fund named in subdivision 3, based on the date of the person's initial entry into
public employment from the date the person terminated all public service if:

     2­) (3) the person has not begun to receive an annuity from any enumerated plan or the person
has made application for benefits from each applicable plan and the effective dates of the retirement
annuity with each plan under which the person chooses to receive an annuity are within a one-year
period.
    (c) The retirement annuity from each plan must be based upon the allowable service, accrual
rates, and average salary in the applicable plan except as further specified or modified in the
following clauses:
    (1) the laws governing annuities must be the law in effect on the date of termination from the last
period of public service under a covered retirement plan with which the person earned a minimum
of one-half year of allowable service credit during that employment;
    (2) the "average salary" on which the annuity from each covered plan in which the employee has
credit in a formula plan must be based on the employee's highest five successive years of covered
salary during the entire service in covered plans;
   (3) the accrual rates to be used by each plan must be those percentages prescribed by each
plan's formula as continued for the respective years of allowable service from one plan to the next,
recognizing all previous allowable service with the other covered plans;
    (4) the allowable service in all the plans must be combined in determining eligibility for and the
application of each plan's provisions in respect to reduction in the annuity amount for retirement
prior to normal retirement age; and
   (5) the annuity amount payable for any allowable service under a nonformula plan of a covered
plan must not be affected, but such service and covered salary must be used in the above calculation.
   (d) This section does not apply to any person whose final termination from the last public service
under a covered plan was before May 1, 1975.
    (e) For the purpose of computing annuities under this section, the accrual rates used by any
covered plan, except the public employees police and fire plan, the judges retirement fund, and the
State Patrol retirement plan, must not exceed the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision
4, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The formula percentage used
by the judges retirement fund must not exceed the percentage rate specified in section 356.315,
subdivision 8, per year of service for any year of service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate used
by the public employees police and fire plan and the State Patrol retirement plan must not exceed
the percentage rate specified in section 356.315, subdivision 6, per year of service for any year of
service or fraction thereof. The accrual rate or rates used by the legislators retirement plan must not
exceed 2.5 percent, but this limit does not apply to the adjustment provided under section 3A.02,
subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
   (f) Any period of time for which a person has credit in more than one of the covered plans must
be used only once for the purpose of determining total allowable service.
    (g) If the period of duplicated service credit is more than one-half year, or the person has credit for
more than one-half year, with each of the plans, each plan must apply its formula to a prorated service
credit for the period of duplicated service based on a fraction of the salary on which deductions were
paid to that fund for the period divided by the total salary on which deductions were paid to all plans
for the period.

    (h) If the period of duplicated service credit is less than one-half year, or when added to other
service credit with that plan is less than one-half year, the service credit must be ignored and a refund
of contributions made to the person in accord with that plan's refund provisions.

by the executive director after one year from the date the employee returned to work following the
authorized leave, the payment amount is the amount determined under section 356.551. Payment
under this paragraph must be made before the date of termination from public employment covered
under this chapter.
    (c) If the employee terminates employment covered by this chapter during the leave or following
the leave rather than returning to covered employment, payment must be received by the executive
director within 30 days after the termination date. The payment amount is equal to the employee and
employer contribution rates specified in section 352B.02 on the day prior to the termination date,
multiplied by the employee's hourly rate of salary on that date and by the days and months of the
leave of absence prior to termination.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

COVERAGE.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the terms in paragraphs (b) to (e)
have the meanings given them.
    (b) "Chief administrative officer" means the person selected or elected by the governing board
of a covered pension plan with primary responsibility to administer the covered pension plan, or
that person's designee or representative.
    (c) "Covered pension plan" means a plan enumerated in section 356.30, subdivision 3, except
clauses (3), (5), (6), and (11).
    (d) "Governing board" means the governing board of the Minnesota State Retirement System,
the Public Employees Retirement Association, the Teachers Retirement Association, the Duluth

     (e) "Member" means an active plan member in a covered pension plan.

    Subd. 2. Treatment of terminated employee coverage error. Any person who terminated the
erroneously covered service before a chief administrative officer determined the covered pension
plan coverage was in error retains the coverage with the plan that originally credited the service.
   Subd. 3. Active employee correction of prospective service coverage. Upon determination by
a chief administrative officer that a member is covered by the wrong pension plan, the employer
must stop remitting the erroneous employee deductions and employer contributions and report the
employee to the correct covered pension plan for all subsequent service.
    Subd. 4. Active employee treatment of past service. Any plan member, with past service
credited in an erroneous plan, retains the coverage for that past service with the plan that originally
credited that service if the reporting error began earlier than two fiscal years prior to the current
fiscal year in which the error was determined by the chief administrative officer. If the reporting
error began within two fiscal years prior to the current fiscal year, the pension plan coverage for that
past service must be corrected as provided in subdivision 5.
    Subd. 5. Past service transfer procedure. (a) For cases under subdivision 4 requiring
correction of prior service coverage, on behalf of the applicable member the chief administrative
officer of the covered pension plan fund that has received erroneous employee deductions and
employer contributions must transfer to the appropriate covered retirement plan fund an amount
which is the lesser of all contributions made by or on behalf of the member for the period of
erroneous membership, or the specific amount requested by the chief administrative officer of the
other covered pension plan which represents the employee deductions and employer contributions
that would have been made had the member been properly reported.
    (b) If excess employee deductions remain in the member's account after the transfer of funds,
the remaining erroneous amount must be refunded to the person with interest at the rate provided
under the general refund law of the applicable covered pension plan. The chief administrative officer
must also return any remaining excess employer contributions by providing to the employer a credit
against future contributions payable by that employer.
    (c) If the contributions transferred to the correct covered pension plan fund are less than the
amounts required for the period being corrected, the chief administrative officer of the correct
covered pension plan fund must collect the remaining employee deductions and employer
contributions from the employer under laws for recovering deficient contributions applicable to the
correct covered pension plan, except that no interest is chargeable if the additional amounts due
under this paragraph are received by the chief administrative officer within 30 days of notifying
the employer of the amount due.
    (d) A potential transfer under this section that would cause a plan to fail to be a qualified plan
under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, must not be made. Within 30 days
after being notified by a chief administrative officer of an unmade potential transfer under this
section, the employer of the member must transmit an amount representing the applicable salary
deductions and employer contributions, without interest, to the fund of the appropriate covered
pension plan. The chief administrative officer of the covered pension plan which erroneously
provided coverage must provide to the employer a credit for the amount of the erroneous salary
deductions and employer contributions against future contributions from that employer.
   (e) Upon transfer of the required assets, or payment from the employer under paragraph (d),
whichever is applicable, allowable service and salary credit for the period being transferred is

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 490.123, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Correction of contribution errors. (a) If erroneous employee deductions and employer
contributions are caused by an error in plan coverage involving the judges retirement plan and any
other plan specified in section 356.99, that section applies.
    (b) The provisions of section 352.04, subdivisions 8 and 9, apply to the judges' retirement
plan, except that if employee deductions or contributions are erroneously transmitted to the judges'
retirement fund for service rendered after the service credit limit under section 490.121, subdivision
22, has been attained, consistent with section 352D.04, subdivision 2, no employer contributions
may be transferred.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 19. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 352.91, subdivision 5; and 353.88, are repealed.

thereof, as set forth in the plan document. The executive director of the system at the direction
of the board of directors shall establish procedures to carry out this section including allocation

    (b) The plan document must conform to federal and state tax laws, regulations, and rulings, and
is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.
    (c) The executive director may contract with a third party to perform administrative and record
keeping functions. The executive director may solicit bids and negotiate such contracts. Participating
employers must provide the necessary data to the third-party record keeper as determined by the
executive director. The third-party record keeper and the Minnesota State Retirement System shall
follow the data privacy provisions under chapter 13. The third-party record keeper may not solicit
participants for any product or services not related to the deferred compensation plan.
    (d) The board of directors may authorize a third-party investment consultant to provide
investment information and advice, ­

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 353.01, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
   Subd. 16. Allowable service; limits and computation. (a) "Allowable service" means:
   (1) service during years of actual membership in the course of which employee deductions were
withheld from salary and contributions were made at the applicable rates under section 353.27,
11234                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [103RD DAY

353.65, or 353E.03;
   (2) periods of service covered by payments in lieu of salary deductions under sections 353.27,
subdivision 12, and 353.35;
   (3) service in years during which the public employee was not a member but for which the
member later elected, while a member, to obtain credit by making payments to the fund as permitted
by any law then in effect;
   (4) a period of authorized leave of absence with pay from which deductions for employee
contributions are made, deposited, and credited to the fund;
    (5) a period of authorized personal, parental, or medical leave of absence without pay, including
a leave of absence covered under the federal Family Medical Leave Act, that does not exceed one
year, and for which a member obtained service credit for each month in the leave period by payment
under section 353.0161 to the fund made in place of salary deductions. An employee must return to
public service and render a minimum of three months of allowable service in order to be eligible to
make payment under section 353.0161 for a subsequent authorized leave of absence without pay.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (6) a periodic, repetitive leave that is offered to all employees of a governmental subdivision.
The leave program may not exceed 208 hours per annual normal work cycle as certified to the
association by the employer. A participating member obtains service credit by making employee
contributions in an amount or amounts based on the member's average salary, excluding overtime
pay, that would have been paid if the leave had not been taken. The employer shall pay the employer
and additional employer contributions on behalf of the participating member. The employee and
the employer are responsible to pay interest on their respective shares at the rate of 8.5 percent
a year, compounded annually, from the end of the normal cycle until full payment is made. An
employer shall also make the employer and additional employer contributions, plus 8.5 percent
interest, compounded annually, on behalf of an employee who makes employee contributions but
terminates public service. The employee contributions must be made within one year after the
end of the annual normal working cycle or within 30 days after termination of public service,
whichever is sooner. The executive director shall prescribe the manner and forms to be used by a
governmental subdivision in administering a periodic, repetitive leave. Upon payment, the member
must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period;
    (7) an authorized temporary or seasonal layoff under subdivision 12, limited to three months
allowable service per authorized temporary or seasonal layoff in one calendar year. An employee
who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary
or seasonal layoff;
    (8) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental subdivision
by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code, title 38, section
4303(13), if the member returns to public service with the same governmental subdivision upon
discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided that the member did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions. The service
­s
i­ must be credited if the member pays into the fund equivalent employee contributions based upon
103RD DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                        11235

the contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed multiplied
by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual
salary rate is the average annual salary, excluding overtime pay, during the purchase period that the
member would have received if the member had continued to be employed in covered employment
rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that rate is not reasonably
certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate, excluding overtime pay, during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during a period
that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that is three times
the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge from the military
service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year, the contributions
required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year of the discharge
date. Payment may not be accepted following 30 days after termination of public service under
subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause are not paid in
full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional
number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the
total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise required under this
clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the member if the member
makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must be made from funds
available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer contribution rate or
rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary
rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The governmental subdivision
involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of service credit obtainable under
this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase period is required under United States
Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent member and
employer contribution amounts payable under this clause. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5
percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service
to the end of the month in which the payment is received. Upon payment, the employee must be
granted allowable service credit for the purchased period; or
   (9) a period specified under subdivision 40.
    (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable
service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
     (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief
association that has consolidated with the Public Employees Retirement Association or to which
section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage provided by the public
employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following the consolidation or under
section 353.665, subdivision 4, "applicable service" is a period of service credited by the local police
or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the consolidation based on law and on
bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date of the initiation of the consolidation
procedure.
   (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either for
11236                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [103RD DAY

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.0161, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Purchase procedure. (a) An employee covered by a plan specified in subdivision 1
may purchase credit for allowable service in that plan for a period specified in subdivision 1 if the
employee makes a payment as specified in paragraph (b) or (c), whichever applies. The employing
unit, at its option, may pay the employer portion of the amount specified in paragraph (b) on behalf
of its employees.
     (b) If payment is received by the executive director within one year from the date the member
returned to work following the authorized leave, or within 30 days after the date of termination of
public service if the member did not return to work, the payment amount is equal to the employee and
employer contribution rates specified in law for the applicable plan at the end of the leave period, or
at termination of public service, whichever is earlier, multiplied by the employee's average monthly
salary, excluding overtime, upon which deductions were paid during the six months, or portion
thereof, before the commencement of the leave of absence and by the number of months of the
leave of absence for which the employee wants allowable service credit. Payments made under this
paragraph must include compound interest at a monthly rate of 0.71 percent from the last day of the
leave period until the last day of the month in which payment is received.
    (c) If payment is received by the executive director after one year, the payment amount is the
amount determined under section 356.551. Payment under this paragraph must be made before the
date the person terminates public service under section 353.01, subdivision 11a.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. [353.0162] REDUCED SALARY PERIODS SALARY CREDIT PURCHASE.
   (a) A member may purchase additional salary credit for a period specified in this section.
   (b) The applicable period is a period during which the member is receiving a reduced salary
from the employer while the member is:
   (1) receiving temporary workers' compensation payments related to the member's service to the
public employer;
   (2) on an authorized medical leave of absence; or
   (3) on an authorized partial paid leave of absence as a result of a budgetary or salary savings
program offered or mandated by a governmental subdivision.
    (c) The differential salary amount is the difference between the average monthly salary received
by the member during the period of reduced salary under this section and the average monthly salary
of the member, excluding overtime, on which contributions to the applicable plan were made during
the period of the last six months of covered employment occurring immediately before the period of
reduced salary, applied to the member's normal employment period, measured in hours or otherwise,
as applicable.

   (d) To receive eligible salary credit, the member shall pay an amount equal to:
   (1) the applicable employee contribution rate under section 353.27, subdivision 2; 353.65,
subdivision 2; or 353E.03, subdivision 1, as applicable, multiplied by the differential salary amount;
    (2) plus an employer equivalent payment equal to the applicable employer contribution rate
in section 353.27, subdivision 3; 353.65, subdivision 3; or 353E.03, subdivision 2, as applicable,
multiplied by the differential salary amount;
  (3) plus, if applicable, an equivalent employer additional amount equal to the additional
employer contribution rate in section 353.27, subdivision 3a, multiplied by the differential salary
amount.
   (e) The employer, by appropriate action of its governing body and documented in its official
records, may pay the employer equivalent contributions and, as applicable, the equivalent employer
additional contributions on behalf of the member.
    (f) Payment under this section must include interest on the contribution amount or amounts,
whichever applies, at an 8.5 percent annual rate, prorated for applicable months from the date on
which the period of reduced salary specified under this section terminates to the date on which the
payment or payments are received by the executive director. Payment under this section must be
completed within the earlier of 30 days from termination of public service by the employee under
section 353.01, subdivision 11a, or one year after the termination of the period specified in paragraph
(b), as further restricted under this section.
    (g) The period for which additional allowable salary credit may be purchased is limited to
the period during which the person receives temporary workers' compensation payments or for
those business years in which the governmental subdivision offers or mandates a budget or salary
savings program, as certified to the executive director by a resolution of the governing body of
the governmental subdivision. For an authorized medical leave of absence, the period for which
allowable salary credit may be purchased may not exceed 12 consecutive months of authorized
medical leave.
    (h) To purchase salary credit for a subsequent period of temporary workers' compensation
benefits or subsequent authorized medical leave of absence, the member must return to public

An employer under review must extract requested data and provide records to the association after
receiving reasonable advanced notice. Failure to provide requested information or materials will
result in the employer being liable to the association for any expenses associated with a field audit,
which may include staff salaries, administrative expenses, and travel expenses.

membership and apply for a refund upon termination of public service or defer an annuity under
section 353.34; or
    (2) invalid, if the initial erroneous employee deduction began on or after January 1, 1990. Upon
determination of the error, the association shall refund all erroneous employee deductions and all
erroneous employer contributions as specified in paragraph (e). No person may claim a right to
continued or past membership in the association based on erroneous deductions which began on or
after January 1, 1990.
    (b) Erroneous deductions taken from the salary of a person who did not qualify for membership
in the association by virtue of concurrent employment before July 1, 1978, which required

governmental subdivision.
    (b) If an employer fails to comply with the reporting requirements under this subdivision, the

    Subdivision 1. Eligibility determination. (a) The chief clerical officer of a governmental
subdivision may submit a resolution from the governing body to the executive director of the
Public Employees Retirement Association which supports providing coverage under this chapter
for employees of that governmental subdivision who are privatized, and which states that the
governing body will pay for actuarial calculations, as further specified in paragraph (c).
    (b) The governing body must also provide a copy of any applicable purchase or lease agreement
and any other information requested by the executive director to allow the executive director
to verify that under the proposed employer change, the new employer does not qualify as a
governmental subdivision under section 353.01, subdivision 6, making the employees ineligible
for continued coverage as active members of the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association.
     (c) Following receipt of a resolution and a determination by the executive director that the new
employer is not a governmental subdivision, the executive director shall direct the consulting actuary
retained under section 356.214 to determine whether the general employees retirement plan of the
Public Employees Retirement Association, if coverage under this chapter is provided, is expected to
receive a net gain or a net loss if privatization occurs,

provided under this chapter, if extended to the applicable employees under the privatization, is more
than the actuarial gain otherwise to accrue to the plan. The date of the actuarial calculations used to
make this determination must be within one year of the effective date, as defined in section 353F.02,
subdivision 3.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353F.025, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Recommendation to legislature. (a) If the actuarial calculations under subdivision
1, paragraph (c), indicate that a net gain to the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association is expected due to the privatization, or if paragraph (c) applies,
the executive director shall forward a recommendation and supporting documentation to the chair of
the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement, the chair of the Governmental Operations,
Reform, Technology and Elections Committee of the house of representatives, the chair of the
State and Local Government Operations and Oversight Committee of the senate, and the executive
director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement. The recommendation must be
in the form of an addition to the definition of "medical facility" under section 353F.02, subdivision
4, or to "other public employing unit" under section 353F.02, subdivision 5, whichever is applicable.
The recommendation must be forwarded to the legislature before January 15 for the recommendation
to be considered in that year's legislative session. The recommendation may be included as part of
public pension administrative legislation under section 356B.05.
    (b) If a medical facility or other public employing unit listed under section 353F.02, subdivision
4 or 5, fails to privatize within one year of the final enactment date of the legislation adding the entity
to the applicable definition, its inclusion under this chapter is voided, and the executive director
shall include in the subsequent proposed legislation under paragraph (a) a recommendation that the
applicable entity be stricken from the definition.
    (c) If the calculations under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), indicate a net loss, the executive
director shall forward a recommendation that the privatization be included as an addition under
paragraph (a) if the chief clerical officer of the applicable governmental subdivision submits a
resolution from the governing body specifying that a lump sum payment will be made to the
executive director equal to the net loss, plus interest. The interest must be computed using the
applicable preretirement interest rate assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, expressed
as a monthly rate, from the date of the actuarial valuation from which the actuarial accrued liability
data was used to determine the net loss in the actuarial study under subdivision 1, to the date of
payment, with annual compounding. Payment must be made on or after the effective date defined
under section 353F.02.

    Subd. 3. Benefit adjustments. (a) For a former member who is receiving a retirement annuity
or disability benefit, or for a person receiving an optional annuity or survivor benefit, the executive
director must:
   (1) adjust the annuity or benefit payment to the correct monthly benefit amount payable by
reducing the average salary under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.01, subdivision 17a, by the
invalid salary amounts;
   (2) determine the amount of the overpaid benefits paid from the effective date of the annuity or
benefit payment to the first of the month in which the monthly benefit amount is corrected;
    (3) calculate the amount of employee deductions taken in error on invalid salary, including
interest at the rate specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 353.34, subdivision 2, from the date
each invalid employee deduction was received through the date the annuity or benefit is adjusted as
provided under clause (1); and
    (4) determine the net amount of overpaid benefits by reducing the amount of the overpaid annuity
or benefit as determined in clause (2) by the amount of the erroneous employee deductions with
interest as determined in clause (3).
    (b) If a former member's erroneous employee deductions plus interest determined under this
section exceeds the amount of the person's overpaid benefits, the balance must be refunded to the
person to whom the annuity or benefit is being paid.
   (c) The executive director shall recover the net amount of all overpaid annuities or benefits as
provided under subdivision 4.
    Subd. 4. Employer credits and obligations. (a) The executive director shall provide a credit
without interest to the city of Duluth ­
                                       an
                                        ­d­, to the Duluth Airport Authority, and to the city of Virginia,
as applicable, for the amount of that governmental subdivision's erroneous employer contributions.
The credit must first be used to offset the net amount of the overpaid retirement annuities and
the disability and survivor benefits that remains after applying the amount of erroneous employee
deductions with interest as provided under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (4). The remaining

erroneous employer contributions, if any, must be credited against future employer contributions
required to be paid by the applicable governmental subdivision. If the overpaid benefits exceed the
employer contribution credit, the balance of the overpaid benefits is the obligation of the city of
Duluth o
       ­­r, the Duluth Airport Authority, or the city of Virginia, whichever is applicable.
    (b) The Public Employees Retirement Association board of trustees shall determine the period
of time and manner for the collection of overpaid retirement annuities and benefits, if any, from the

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 353G.05, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Election of coverage. (a) The process for electing coverage of volunteer firefighters
by the retirement plan is initiated by a request to the executive director for a cost analysis of the
prospective retirement coverage.
    (b) If the volunteer firefighters are currently covered by a volunteer firefighters' relief
association governed by chapter 424A, the cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage
must be requested jointly by the secretary of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, following
approval of the request by the board of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, and the chief
administrative officer of the entity associated with the relief association, following approval
of the request by the governing body of the entity associated with the relief association. If the
relief association is associated with more than one entity, the chief administrative officer of each
associated entity must execute the request. If the volunteer firefighters are not currently covered by
a volunteer firefighters' relief association, the cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage
must be requested by the chief administrative officer of the entity operating the fire department. The
request must be made in writing and must be made on a form prescribed by the executive director.
    (c) The cost analysis of the prospective retirement coverage by the statewide retirement plan
must be based on the service pension amount under section 353G.11 closest to the service pension
                                                                 ­ if ­h

account balance per relief association member if the relief association is a defined contribution plan,
or to the lowest service pension amount under section 353G.11 if there is no volunteer firefighters'
relief association, rounded up, and any other service pension amount designated by the requester or
requesters. The cost analysis must be prepared using a mathematical procedure certified as accurate
by an approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association.
    (d) If a cost analysis is requested and a volunteer firefighters' relief association exists that
has filed the information required under section 69.051 in a timely fashion, upon request by the
executive director, the state auditor shall provide the most recent data available on the financial
condition of the volunteer firefighters' relief association, the most recent firefighter demographic
data available, and a copy of the current relief association bylaws. If a cost analysis is requested,
but no volunteer firefighters' relief association exists, the chief administrative officer of the
entity operating the fire department shall provide the demographic information on the volunteer
firefighters serving as members of the fire department requested by the executive director.
    (e) If a cost analysis is requested, the executive director of the State Board of Investment
shall review the investment portfolio of the relief association, if applicable, for compliance
with the applicable provisions of chapter 11A and for appropriateness for retention under the
established investment objectives and investment policies of the State Board of Investment. If
the prospective retirement coverage change is approved under paragraph (f), the State Board of
Investment may require that the relief association liquidate any investment security or other asset
which the executive director of the State Board of Investment has determined to be an ineligible
or inappropriate investment for retention by the State Board of Investment. The security or asset
liquidation must occur before the effective date of the transfer of retirement plan coverage. If
requested to do so by the chief administrative officer of the relief association, the executive
director of the State Board of Investment shall provide advice about the best means to conduct the
liquidation.
    (f) Upon receipt of the cost analysis, the governing body of the municipality or independent
nonprofit firefighting corporation associated with the fire department shall either approve or
disapprove the retirement coverage change within 90 days. If the retirement coverage change is
not acted upon within 90 days, it is deemed to be disapproved. If the retirement coverage change
is approved by the applicable governing body, coverage by the voluntary statewide lump-sum

     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 353G.08, is amended to read:
     353G.08 RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING; DISBURSEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Annual funding requirements. (a) Annually, the executive director shall
determine the funding requirements of each account in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer
firefighter retirement plan on or before August 1. The funding requirements as directed under this
section, must be determined using a mathematical procedure developed and certified as accurate
by an approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association and based on
present value factors using a six percent interest rate, without any decrement assumptions. The
funding requirements must be certified to the entity or entities associated with the fire department
whose active firefighters are covered by the retirement plan.
    (b) The overall funding balance of each account for the current calendar year must be determined
in the following manner:
    (1) The total accrued liability for all active and deferred members of the account as of December
31 of the current year must be calculated based on the good time service credit of active and deferred
members as of that date.
    (2) The total present assets of the account projected to December 31 of the current year, including
receipts by and disbursements from the account anticipated to occur on or before December 31,
must be calculated. To the extent possible, the market value of assets must be utilized in making
this calculation.
    (3) The amount of the total present assets calculated under clause (2) must be subtracted from
the amount of the total accrued liability calculated under clause (1). If the amount of total present
assets exceeds the amount of the total accrued liability, then the account is considered to have a
surplus over full funding. If the amount of the total present assets is less than the amount of the total
accrued liability, then the account is considered to have a deficit from full funding. If the amount
of total present assets is equal to the amount of the total accrued liability, then the special fund is
considered to be fully funded.
    (c) The financial requirements of each account for the following calendar year must be
determined in the following manner:
    (1) The total accrued liability for all active and deferred members of the account as of December
31 of the calendar year next following the current calendar year must be calculated based on the good
time service used in the calculation under paragraph (b), clause (1), increased by one year.
    (2) The increase in the total accrued liability of the account for the following calendar year over
the total accrued liability of the account for the current year must be calculated.
     (3) The amount of anticipated future administrative expenses of the account must be calculated
11254                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [103RD DAY

by multiplying the dollar amount of the administrative expenses for the most recent prior calendar
year by the factor of 1.035.
    (4) If the account is fully funded, the financial requirement of the account for the following
calendar year is the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (2) and (3).
    (5) If the account has a deficit from full funding, the financial requirement of the account for
the following calendar year is the total of the amounts calculated under clauses (2) and (3) plus an
amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of the deficit from full funding of the account.
    (6) If the account has a surplus over full funding, the financial requirement of the account for the
following calendar year is the financial requirement of the account calculated as though the account
was fully funded under clause (4) and, if the account has also had a surplus over full funding during
the prior two years, additionally reduced by an amount equal to one-tenth of the amount of the
surplus over full funding of the account.
    (d) The required contribution of the entity or entities associated with the fire department whose
active firefighters are covered by the retirement plan is the annual financial requirements of the
account of the retirement plan under paragraph (c) reduced by the amount of any fire state aid
payable under sections 69.011 to 69.051 reasonably anticipated to be received by the retirement plan
attributable to the entity or entities during the following calendar year, and an amount of interest on
the assets projected to be received during the following calendar year calculated at the rate of six
percent per annum. The required contribution must be allocated between the entities if more than
one entity is involved. A reasonable amount of anticipated fire state aid is an amount that does not
exceed the fire state aid actually received in the prior year multiplied by the factor 1.035.
    (e) The required contribution calculated in paragraph (d) must be paid to the retirement plan on
or before December 31 of the year for which it was calculated. If the contribution is not received by
the retirement plan by December 31, it is payable with interest at an annual compound rate of six
percent from the date due until the date payment is received by the retirement plan. If the entity does
not pay the full amount of the required contribution, the executive director shall collect the unpaid
amount under section 353.28, subdivision 6.
    Subd. 2. Cash flow funding requirement. If the executive director determines that an account
in the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter retirement plan has insufficient assets to
meet the service pensions determined payable from the account, the executive director shall certify
the amount of the potential service pension shortfall to the municipality or municipalities and the
municipality or municipalities shall make an additional employer contribution to the account within
ten days of the certification. If more than one municipality is associated with the account, unless
the municipalities agree to a different allocation, the municipalities shall allocate the additional
employer contribution one-half in proportion to the population of each municipality and one-half in
proportion to the market value of the property of each municipality.
   Subd. 3. Authorized account disbursements. ­

   (5) the disability benefit coverage insurance premiums under section 353G.115.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2010.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 353G.09, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. Alternative pension eligibility and computation. (a) An active member of the
retirement plan is entitled to an alternative lump-sum service pension from the retirement plan if
the person:
   (1) has separated from active service with the fire department for at least 30 days;
    (2) has attained the age of at least 50 years or the age for receipt of a service pension under
the benefit plan of the applicable former volunteer firefighters' relief association as of the date
immediately prior to the election of the retirement coverage change, whichever is later;
    (3) has completed at least five years of active service with the fire department and at least five
years in total as a member of the applicable former volunteer firefighters' relief association or of the
retirement plan, but has not rendered at least five years of good time service credit as a member of
the retirement plan; and
   (4) applies in a manner prescribed by the executive director for the service pension.
    (b) If retirement coverage prior to statewide retirement plan coverage was provided by a defined
benefit plan volunteer firefighters relief association, the alternative lump-sum service pension is
the service pension amount specified in the bylaws of the applicable former volunteer firefighters'
relief association either as of the date immediately prior to the election of the retirement coverage
change or as of the date immediately before the termination of firefighting services, whichever is
earlier, multiplied by the total number of years of service as a member of that volunteer firefighters'
relief association and as a member of the retirement plan. If retirement coverage prior to statewide
retirement plan coverage was provided by a defined contribution plan volunteer firefighters relief
association, the alternative lump-sum service pension is an amount equal to the person's account
balance as of the date immediately prior to the date on which statewide retirement plan coverage
was first provided to the person plus six percent annual compound interest from that date until the
date immediately prior to the date of retirement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2010.

terms of the plan;
   (2) is not payable for a period that exceeds the time that pension plan benefits are payable to the

   (3) is not payable in a lump-sum amount from defined benefit pension plan assets attributable in
any fashion to a spouse with the status of an active member, deferred retiree, or benefit recipient of
a pension plan;
   (4) if the former spouse to whom the payments are to be made dies prior to the end of the specified

liquidated property.

vested pension benefits or rights is not available, the court may order the revocation of the

actuarially required contributions are equal to or less than the total rates under this section in effect
as of January 1, 2008.
    (c) This subdivision is repealed once the actuarial value of the assets of the general employees
retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association equal or exceed the actuarial
accrued liability of the plan as determined by the actuary retained under sections 356.214 and
356.215. The repeal is effective on the first day of the first full pay period occurring after March
31 of the calendar year following the issuance of the actuarial valuation upon which the repeal is
based.
   Subd. 3b. Change in employee and employer contributions in certain instances. (a) For

purposes of this section, a contribution sufficiency exists if the total of the employee contribution
under subdivision 2, the employer contribution under subdivision 3, the additional employer
contribution under subdivision 3a, and any additional contribution previously imposed under this
subdivision exceeds the total of the normal cost, the administrative expenses, and the amortization
contribution of the general employees retirement plan as reported in the most recent actuarial
valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the actuary retained under section 356.214 and
prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial work of the Legislative Commission
on Pensions and Retirement. For purposes of this section, a contribution deficiency exists if
the total of the employee contributions under subdivision 2, the employer contributions under
subdivision 3, the additional employer contribution under subdivision 3a, and any additional
contribution previously imposed under this subdivision is less than the total of the normal cost, the
administrative expenses, and the amortization contribution of the general employees retirement
plan as reported in the most recent actuarial valuation of the retirement plan prepared by the actuary
retained under section 356.214 and prepared under section 356.215 and the standards for actuarial
work of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
   (b) Employee and employer contributions to the general employees retirement plan under
subdivisions 2 and 3 must be adjusted:
    (1) if, after July 1, 2010, the regular actuarial valuations of the general employees retirement
plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association under section 356.215 indicate that there is a
contribution sufficiency under paragraph (a) equal to or greater than 0.5 percent of covered payroll
for two consecutive years, the coordinated program employee and employer contribution rates must
be decreased as determined under paragraph (c) to a level such that the sufficiency equals no more
than 0.25 percent of covered payroll based on the most recent actuarial valuation; or
    (2) if, after July 1, 2010, the regular actuarial valuations of the general employees retirement
plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association under section 356.215 indicate that there is
a deficiency equal to or greater than 0.5 percent of covered payroll for two consecutive years, the
coordinated program employee and employer contribution rates must be increased as determined
under paragraph (c) to a level such that no deficiency exists based on the most recent actuarial
valuation.
    (c) The general employees retirement plan contribution rate increase or decrease must be
determined by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association, must be
reported to the chair and the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement on or before the next February 1, and, if the Legislative Commission on Pensions and
Retirement does not recommend against the rate change or does not recommend a modification in
the rate change, is effective on the next July 1 following the determination by the executive director
that a contribution deficiency or sufficiency has existed for two consecutive fiscal years based on
the most recent actuarial valuations under section 356.215. If the actuarially required contribution
of the general employees retirement plan exceeds or is less than the total support provided by the
combined employee and employer contribution rates by more than 0.5 percent of covered payroll,
the general employees retirement plan coordinated program employee and employer contribution
rates must be adjusted incrementally over one or more years to a level such that there remains a
contribution sufficiency of no more than 0.25 percent of covered payroll.
    (d) No incremental adjustment may exceed 0.25 percent for either the general employees
retirement plan coordinated program employee and employer contribution rates per year in

which any adjustment is implemented. A general employees retirement plan contribution rate
adjustment under this subdivision must not be made until at least two years have passed since fully
implementing a previous adjustment under this subdivision.
   (e) The general employees retirement plan contribution sufficiency or deficiency determination
under paragraphs (a) to (d) must be made without the inclusion of the contributions to, the funded
condition of, or the actuarial funding requirements of the MERF division.
    Subd. 4. Employer reporting requirements; contributions; member status. (a) A
representative authorized by the head of each department shall deduct employee contributions from
the salary of each employee who qualifies for membership in the general employees retirement
plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association or in the public employees police and fire
retirement plan under this chapter and remit payment in a manner prescribed by the executive
director for the aggregate amount of the employee contributions, the employer contributions and
the additional employer contributions to be received within 14 calendar days. The head of each
department or the person's designee shall for each pay period submit to the association a salary
deduction report in the format prescribed by the executive director. Data required to be submitted
as part of salary deduction reporting must include, but are not limited to:
      (1) the legal names and Social Security numbers of employees who are members;
      (2) the amount of each employee's salary deduction;
      (3) the amount of salary from which each deduction was made;
      (4) the beginning and ending dates of the payroll period covered and the date of actual payment;
and
      (5) adjustments or corrections covering past pay periods.
    (b) Employers must furnish the data required for enrollment for each new employee who
qualifies for membership in the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees
Retirement Association or in the public employees police and fire retirement plan in the format
prescribed by the executive director. The required enrollment data on new employees must be
submitted to the association prior to or concurrent with the submission of the initial employee salary
deduction. The employer shall also report to the association all member employment status changes,
such as leaves of absence, terminations, and death, and shall report the effective dates of those
changes, on an ongoing basis for the payroll cycle in which they occur. The employer shall furnish
data, forms, and reports as may be required by the executive director for proper administration of
the retirement system. Before implementing new or different computerized reporting requirements,
the executive director shall give appropriate advance notice to governmental subdivisions to allow
time for system modifications.

   Subd. 7. Adjustment for erroneous receipts or disbursements. (a) Except as provided in
paragraph (b), erroneous employee deductions and erroneous employer contributions and additional
employer contributions to the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees
Retirement Association or to the public employees police and fire retirement plan for a person,
who otherwise does not qualify for membership under this chapter, are considered:
103RD DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                        11275

    (1) valid if the initial erroneous deduction began before January 1, 1990. Upon determination of
the error by the association, the person may continue membership in the association while employed
in the same position for which erroneous deductions were taken, or file a written election to terminate
membership and apply for a refund upon termination of public service or defer an annuity under
section 353.34; or
    (2) invalid, if the initial erroneous employee deduction began on or after January 1, 1990. Upon
determination of the error, the association shall refund all erroneous employee deductions and all
erroneous employer contributions as specified in paragraph (e). No person may claim a right to
continued or past membership in the association based on erroneous deductions which began on or
after January 1, 1990.
    (b) Erroneous deductions taken from the salary of a person who did not qualify for membership
in the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association or in the
public employees police and fire retirement plan by virtue of concurrent employment before July 1,
1978, which required contributions to another retirement fund or relief association established for
the benefit of officers and employees of a governmental subdivision, are invalid. Upon discovery of
the error, the association shall remove all invalid service and, upon termination of public service, the
association shall refund all erroneous employee deductions to the person, with interest as determined
under section 353.34, subdivision 2, and all erroneous employer contributions without interest to
the employer. This paragraph has both retroactive and prospective application.
    (c) Adjustments to correct employer contributions and employee deductions taken in error from
amounts which are not salary under section 353.01, subdivision 10, must be made as specified in
paragraph (e). The period of adjustment must be limited to the fiscal year in which the error is
discovered by the association and the immediate two preceding fiscal years.
    (d) If there is evidence of fraud or other misconduct on the part of the employee or the employer,
the board of trustees may authorize adjustments to the account of a member or former member
to correct erroneous employee deductions and employer contributions on invalid salary and the
recovery of any overpayments for a period longer than provided for under paragraph (c).
    (e) Upon discovery of the receipt of erroneous employee deductions and employer contributions
under paragraph (a), clause (2), or paragraph (c), the association must require the employer to
discontinue the erroneous employee deductions and erroneous employer contributions reported on
behalf of a member. Upon discontinuation, the association must:
    (1) for a member, provide a refund or credit to the employer in the amount of the invalid
employee deductions with interest on the invalid employee deductions at the rate specified under
section 353.34, subdivision 2, from the received date of each invalid salary transaction through the
date the credit or refund is made; and the employer must pay the refunded employee deductions
plus interest to the member;
   (2) for a former member who:
    (i) is not receiving a retirement annuity or benefit, return the erroneous employee deductions
to the former member through a refund with interest at the rate specified under section 353.34,
subdivision 2, from the received date of each invalid salary transaction through the date the credit
or refund is made; or
11276                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [103RD DAY

   (ii) is receiving a retirement annuity or disability benefit, or a person who is receiving an optional
annuity or survivor benefit, for whom it has been determined an overpayment must be recovered,
adjust the payment amount and recover the overpayments as provided under this section; and
    (3) return the invalid employer contributions reported on behalf of a member or former member
to the employer by providing a credit against future contributions payable by the employer.
    (f) In the event that a salary warrant or check from which a deduction for the retirement fund
was taken has been canceled or the amount of the warrant or check returned to the funds of the
department making the payment, a refund of the sum deducted, or any portion of it that is required
to adjust the deductions, must be made to the department or institution.
    (g) If the accrual date of any retirement annuity, survivor benefit, or disability benefit is within
the limitation period specified in paragraph (c), and an overpayment has resulted by using invalid
service or salary, or due to any erroneous calculation procedure, the association must recalculate the
annuity or benefit payable and recover any overpayment as provided under subdivision 7b.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the association may apply the Revenue
Procedures defined in the federal Internal Revenue Service Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System and not issue a refund of erroneous employee deductions and employer contributions or not
recover a small overpayment of benefits if the cost to correct the error would exceed the amount of
the member refund or overpayment.
   (i) Any fees or penalties assessed by the federal Internal Revenue Service for any failure by an
employer to follow the statutory requirements for reporting eligible members and salary must be
paid by the employer.
    Subd. 7a. Deductions or contributions transmitted by error. (a) If employee deductions and
employer contributions under this section, section 353.50, 353.65, or 353E.03 were erroneously
transmitted to the association, but should have been transmitted to another Minnesota public
pension plan, the executive director shall transfer the erroneous employee deductions and employer
contributions to the appropriate retirement fund or individual account, as applicable, without
interest. The time limitations specified in subdivisions 7 and 12 do not apply.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a Minnesota public pension plan means a plan specified in
section 356.30, subdivision 3, or the plans governed by chapters 353D and 354B.
    (c) A potential transfer under paragraph (a) that is reasonably determined to cause the plan to
fail to be a qualified plan under section 401(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended,
must not be made by the executive director of the association. Within 30 days after being notified by
the Public Employees Retirement Association of an unmade potential transfer under this paragraph,
the employer of the affected person must transmit an amount representing the applicable salary
deductions and employer contributions, without interest, to the retirement fund of the appropriate
Minnesota public pension plan, or to the applicable individual account if the proper coverage is
by a defined contribution plan. The association must provide the employing unit a credit for the
amount of the erroneous salary deductions and employer contributions against future contributions
from the employer. If the employing unit receives a credit under this paragraph, the employing
unit is responsible for refunding to the applicable employee any amount that had been erroneously
deducted from the person's salary.

    Subd. 7b. Recovery of overpayments. (a) In the event the executive director determines that
an overpaid annuity or benefit ­h  t­­
                                     a­
                                      t from the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association, the public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the
local government correctional employees retirement plan is the result of invalid salary included in
the average salary used to calculate the payment amount must be recovered, the association must
determine the amount of the employee deductions taken in error on the invalid salary, with interest
determined in the manner provided for a former member under subdivision 7, paragraph (e), clause
(2), item (i), and must subtract that amount from the total annuity or benefit overpayment, and the
remaining balance of the overpaid annuity or benefit, if any, must be recovered.
    (b) If the invalid employee deductions plus interest exceed the amount of the overpaid benefits,
the balance must be refunded to the person to whom the benefit or annuity is being paid.
  (c) Any invalid employer contributions reported on the invalid salary must be credited to the
employer as provided in subdivision 7, paragraph (e).
    (d) If a member or former member, who is receiving a retirement annuity or disability benefit for
which an overpayment is being recovered, dies before recovery of the overpayment is completed
and a joint and survivor optional annuity is payable, the remaining balance of the overpaid annuity
or benefit must continue to be recovered from the payment to the optional annuity beneficiary.
    (e) If the association finds that a refund has been overpaid to a former member, beneficiary or
other person, the amount of the overpayment must be recovered for the benefit of the respective
retirement fund or account.
    (f) The board of trustees shall adopt policies directing the period of time and manner for the
collection of any overpaid retirement or optional annuity, and survivor or disability benefit, or a
refund that the executive director determines must be recovered as provided under this section.
    Subd. 7c. Limitation on additional plan coverage. No deductions for any plan under
this chapter or chapter 353E may be taken from the salary of a person who is employed by a
governmental subdivision under section 353.01, subdivision 6, and who is receiving disability
benefit payments from any plan under this chapter or chapter 353E unless the person waives the
right to further disability benefit payments.

     (b) In the event payroll abstract records have been lost or destroyed, for whatever reason or in
whatever manner, so that such schedules of salaries cannot be furnished therefrom, the employing
governmental subdivision, in lieu thereof, shall furnish to the association an estimate of the earnings
of any employee or former employee for any period as may be requested by the executive director.
If the association is provided a schedule of estimated earnings, the executive director is authorized
to use the same as a basis for making whatever computations might be necessary for determining
obligations of the employee and employer to the general employees retirement ­          fu
                                                                                         ­n­d

public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the local government correctional employees
retirement plan. If estimates are not furnished by the employer at the request of the executive
director, the executive director may estimate the obligations of the employee and employer to the
general employees retirement fund, the public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the
local government correctional employees retirement plan based upon those records that are in its
possession.
    Subd. 12. Omitted salary deductions; obligations. (a) In the case of omission of required
deductions for the general employees retirement plan, the public employees police and fire
retirement plan, or the local government correctional employees retirement plan from the salary
of an employee, the department head or designee shall immediately, upon discovery, report the
employee for membership and deduct the employee deductions under subdivision 4 during the
current pay period or during the pay period immediately following the discovery of the omission.
Payment for the omitted obligations may only be made in accordance with reporting procedures
and methods established by the executive director.
   (b) When the entire omission period of an employee does not exceed 60 days, the governmental
subdivision may report and submit payment of the omitted employee deductions and the omitted
employer contributions through the reporting processes under subdivision 4.

   (c) When the omission period of an employee exceeds 60 days, the governmental subdivision
shall furnish to the association sufficient data and documentation upon which the obligation for
omitted employee and employer contributions can be calculated. The omitted employee deductions
must be deducted from the employee's subsequent salary payment or payments and remitted to the
association for deposit in the applicable retirement fund. The employee shall pay omitted employee
deductions due for the 60 days prior to the end of the last pay period in the omission period during
which salary was earned. The employer shall pay any remaining omitted employee deductions
and any omitted employer contributions, plus cumulative interest at an annual rate of 8.5 percent
compounded annually, from the date or dates each omitted employee contribution was first payable.
    (d) An employer shall not hold an employee liable for omitted employee deductions beyond
the pay period dates under paragraph (c), nor attempt to recover from the employee those employee
deductions paid by the employer on behalf of the employee. Omitted deductions due under paragraph
(c) which are not paid by the employee constitute a liability of the employer that failed to deduct the
omitted deductions from the employee's salary. The employer shall make payment with interest at
an annual rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually. Omitted employee deductions are no longer due
if an employee terminates public service before making payment of omitted employee deductions to
the association, but the employer remains liable to pay omitted employer contributions plus interest
at an annual rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually from the date the contributions were first
payable.
    (e) The association may not commence action for the recovery of omitted employee deductions
and employer contributions after the expiration of three calendar years after the calendar year in
which the contributions and deductions were omitted. Except as provided under paragraph (b), no
payment may be made or accepted unless the association has already commenced action for recovery
of omitted deductions. An action for recovery commences on the date of the mailing of any written
correspondence from the association requesting information from the governmental subdivision
upon which to determine whether or not omitted deductions occurred.
    Subd. 12a. Terminated employees: omitted deductions. A terminated employee who was a
member of the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association,
the public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the local government correctional
employees retirement plan and who has a period of employment in which previously omitted
employer contributions were made under subdivision 12 but for whom no, or only partial, omitted
employee contributions have been made, or a member who had prior coverage in the association
for which previously omitted employer contributions were made under subdivision 12 but who
terminated service before required omitted employee deductions could be withheld from salary,
may pay the omitted employee deductions for the period on which omitted employer contributions
were previously paid plus interest at an annual rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually. A
terminated employee may pay the omitted employee deductions plus interest within six months
of an initial notification from the association of eligibility to pay those omitted deductions. If
a terminated employee is reemployed in a position covered under a public pension fund under
section 356.30, subdivision 3, and elects to pay omitted employee deductions, payment must be
made no later than six months after a subsequent termination of public service.
   Subd. 12b. Terminated employees: immediate eligibility. If deductions were omitted
from salary adjustments or final salary of a terminated employee who was a member of the
general employees retirement plan, the public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the

local government correctional employees retirement plan and who is immediately eligible to
draw a monthly benefit, the employer shall pay the omitted employer and employer additional
contributions plus interest on both the employer and employee amounts due at an annual rate of
8.5 percent compounded annually. The employee shall pay the employee deductions within six
months of an initial notification from the association of eligibility to pay omitted deductions or the
employee forfeits the right to make the payment.
    Subd. 13. Certain warrants canceled. A warrant payable from the general employees
retirement fund, the public employees police and fire retirement fund, or the local government
correctional retirement fund remaining unpaid for a period of six months must be canceled into the
applicable retirement fund and not canceled into the state's general fund.
    Subd. 14. Periods before initial coverage date. (a) If an entity is determined to be a
governmental subdivision due to receipt of a written notice of eligibility from the association with
respect to the general employees retirement plan, the public employees police and fire retirement
plan, or the local government correctional retirement plan, that employer and its employees are
subject to the requirements of subdivision 12, effective retroactively to the date that the executive
director of the association determines that the entity first met the definition of a governmental
subdivision, if that date predates the notice of eligibility.
   (b) If the retroactive time period under paragraph (a) exceeds three years, an employee is
authorized to purchase service credit in the applicable Public Employees Retirement Association
plan for the portion of the period in excess of three years, by making payment under section
356.551. Notwithstanding any provision of section 356.551, subdivision 2, to the contrary,
regarding time limits on purchases, payment of a service credit purchase amount may be made
anytime before the termination of public service.
    (c) This subdivision does not apply if the applicable employment under paragraph (a) included
coverage by any public or private defined benefit or defined contribution retirement plan, other than
a volunteer firefighters relief association. If this paragraph applies, an individual is prohibited from
purchasing service credit from a Public Employees Retirement Association plan for any period or
periods specified in paragraph (a).
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.34, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Refund or deferred annuity. (a) A former member is entitled to a refund of
accumulated employee deductions under subdivision 2, or to a deferred annuity under subdivision 3.
Application for a refund may not be made before the date of termination of public service. Except as
specified in paragraph (b), a refund must be paid within 120 days following receipt of the application
unless the applicant has again become a public employee required to be covered by the association.
    (b) If an individual was placed on layoff under section 353.01, subdivision 12 or 12c, a refund
is not payable before termination of service under section 353.01, subdivision 11a.
    (c) An individual who terminates public service covered by the Public Employees Retirement
Association general employees retirement plan, the MERF division, the Public Employees
Retirement Association police and fire retirement plan, or the public employees local government
corrections service retirement plan, and who is employed by a different employer and who becomes
an active member covered by one of the other two plans, may receive a refund of employee
contributions plus six percent interest compounded annually from the plan from which the member

Association, the public employees police and fire retirement plan, or the local government
correctional employees retirement plan must be suspended under subdivision 2 or reduced under
subdivision 3, whichever results in the higher annual annuity amount, if the person reenters public
service as a nonelective employee of a governmental subdivision in a position covered by this
chapter or returns to work as an employee of a labor organization that represents public employees
who are association members under this chapter and salary for the reemployment service exceeds
the annual maximum earnings allowable for that age for the continued receipt of full benefit
amounts monthly under the federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program as set by
the secretary of health and human services under United States Code, title 42, section 403, in any
calendar year. If the person has not yet reached the minimum age for the receipt of Social Security
benefits, the maximum salary for the person is equal to the annual maximum earnings allowable
for the minimum age for the receipt of Social Security benefits.
   (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) do not apply to the members of the MERF division.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

month after the month in which the salary of the reemployed annuitant described in subdivision 1,

in which the annuitant is actually employed in nonelective public service in a position covered under
this chapter or employment with a labor organization that represents public employees who are

person who has not reached the retirement age by one-half of the amount in excess of the applicable
reemployment income maximum under subdivision 1, paragraph (a).

Employees Retirement Fund, but the MERF division is not liable for any claim against the former
Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, its former governing board, or its former administrative
staff acting in a fiduciary capacity under chapter 356A or under common law, which is founded
upon a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, but where the act or acts constituting the claimed breach
were not undertaken in good faith, the Public Employees Retirement Association may assert
any applicable defense to any claim in any judicial or administrative proceeding that the former
Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, its former board, or its former administrative staff
would otherwise have been entitled to assert, and the Public Employees Retirement Association
may assert any applicable defense that it has in its capacity as a statewide agency.

or inactive Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund members with that status as of June 30, 2010,
with the exception of post-December 31, 2010, postretirement adjustments, which are governed by
paragraph (b), as calculated under Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 422A.11; 422A.12; 422A.13;
422A.14; 422A.15; 422A.151; 422A.155; 422A.156; 422A.16; 422A.17; 422A.18; 422A.19;
422A.20; and 422A.23, continue in force after the administrative consolidation under this article.

employee contribution must be made by payroll deduction by the member's employing unit under
section 353.27, subdivision 4, and is subject to the provisions of section 353.27, subdivisions 7, 7a,
7b, 12, 12a, and 12b.
   (c) The employer regular contribution to the MERF division account with respect to an active
MERF division member is 9.75 percent of the total salary of the member as defined in section
353.01, subdivision 10.
    (d) The employer additional contribution to the MERF division account with respect to an active
member of the MERF division is 2.68 percent of the total salary of the member as defined in section

is payable to the former Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund under Minnesota Statutes 2008,
section 422A.101, subdivision 1a, 2, or 2a, during calendar year 2009, as was certified by the former
executive director of the former Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund.

division account by the city of Minneapolis, Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, a
Minneapolis-owned public utility, improvement, or municipal activity, Hennepin county, the
Metropolitan Council, the Metropolitan Airports Commission, and the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities system is the larger of the following:
    (1) the amount by which the total actuarial required contribution determined under section
356.215 by the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement Association in the
most recent actuarial valuation of the MERF division and based on a June 30, 2031, amortization
date, after subtracting the contributions under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), exceeds $22,750,000
or $24,000,000, whichever applies; or
    (2) the amount of $27,000,000, but the total supplemental contribution amount plus the
contributions under paragraphs (c) and (d) may not exceed $34,000,000. Each employing unit's
share of the total employer supplemental contribution amount is equal to the applicable portion
specified in paragraph (g). The initial total actuarial required contribution after June 30, 2012, must
be calculated using the mortality assumption change recommended on September 30, 2009, for
the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund by the approved consulting actuary retained by the
Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund board.
    (f) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c), (d), or (e) to the contrary, as of August
1 annually, if the amount of the retirement annuities and benefits paid from the MERF division
account during the preceding fiscal year, multiplied by the factor of 1.035, exceeds the market value
of the assets of the MERF division account on the preceding June 30, plus state aid of $9,000,000,
$22,750,000, or $24,000,000, whichever applies, plus the amounts payable under paragraphs (b), (c),
(d), and (e) during the preceding fiscal year, multiplied by the factor of 1.035, the balance calculated
is a special additional employer contribution. The special additional employer contribution under
this paragraph is payable in addition to any employer contribution required under paragraphs (c),
(d), and (e), and is payable on or before the following June 30. The special additional employer
contribution under this paragraph must be allocated as specified in paragraph (g).
    (g) The employer supplemental contribution under paragraph (e) or the special additional
employer contribution under paragraph (f) must be allocated between the city of Minneapolis,
Special School District No. 1, Minneapolis, any Minneapolis-owned public utility, improvement,
or municipal activity, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, Hennepin County, the
Metropolitan Council, and the Metropolitan Airports Commission in proportion to their share of
the actuarial accrued liability of the former Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund as of July 1,
2009, as calculated by the approved actuary retained under section 356.214 as part of the actuarial
valuation prepared as of July 1, 2009, under section 356.215 and the Standards for Actuarial Work
adopted by the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
    (h) The employer contributions under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) must be paid as provided in
section 353.28.
   (i) Contributions under this subdivision are subject to the provisions of section 353.27,
subdivisions 4, 7, 7a, 7b, 11, 12, 12a, 12b, 13, and 14.
    Subd. 7a. Minneapolis Municipal Retirement Association dues. If authorized by an annuitant
or retirement benefit recipient in writing on a form prescribed by the executive director of the
Public Employees Retirement Association, the executive director shall deduct the dues for the
Minneapolis Municipal Retirement Association from the person's annuity or retirement benefit.
11286                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [103RD DAY

This dues deduction authority expires upon the eventual full consolidation of the MERF account
under subdivision 8.
    Subd. 8. Eventual full consolidation. (a) Once the fiscal year end market value of assets of
the MERF division account equals or exceeds 80 percent of the actuarial accrued liability of the
MERF division as calculated by the approved actuary retained by the Public Employees Retirement
Association under section 356.215 and the Standards for Actuarial Work adopted by the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement, the MERF division must be merged with the general
employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association and the MERF division
account ceases as a separate account within the general employees retirement fund of the Public
Employees Retirement Association.
    (b) If the market value of the MERF division account is less than 100 percent of the actuarial
accrued liability of the MERF division under paragraph (a), the total employer contribution of
employing units referenced in subdivision 7, paragraph (e), for the period after the full consolidation
and June 30, 2031, to amortize on a level annual dollar payment the remaining unfunded actuarial
accrued liability of the former MERF division account on the full consolidation date by June
30, 2031, shall be calculated by the consulting actuary retained under section 356.214 using the
applicable postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption for the general employees retirement
plan under section 356.215. The actuarial accrued liability of the MERF division must be calculated
using the healthy retired life mortality assumption applicable to the general employees retirement
plan.
    (c) The merger shall occur as of the first day of the first month after the date on which
the triggering actuarial valuation report is filed with the executive director of the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement.
   (d) The executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association shall prepare
proposed legislation fully implementing the merger and updating the applicable provisions of
chapters 353 and 356 and transmit the proposed legislation to the executive director of the
Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement by the following February 15.
    Subd. 9. Merger of former MERF membership groups into PERA-general. If provided for in
an agreement between the board of trustees of the Public Employees Retirement Association and the
governing board of an employing unit formerly with retirement coverage provided for its employees
by the former Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, an employing unit may transfer sufficient
assets to the general employees retirement fund to cover the anticipated actuarial accrued liability
for its current or former employees that is in excess of MERF division account assets attributable
to those employees, have those employees be considered full members of the general employees
retirement plan, and be relieved of any further contribution obligation to the general employees
retirement plan for those employees under this section. Any agreement under this subdivision and
any actuarial valuation report related to a merger under this subdivision must be submitted to the
executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement for comment prior to
the final execution.

   (d) After July 1, 2010, the assumptions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) continue to apply,
unless a different salary assumption or a different payroll increase assumption:
   (1) has been proposed by the governing board of the applicable retirement plan;
   (2) is accompanied by the concurring recommendation of the actuary retained under section
356.214, subdivision 1, if applicable, or by the approved actuary preparing the most recent actuarial
valuation report if section 356.214 does not apply; and
   (3) has been approved or deemed approved under subdivision 18.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 356.215, subdivision 11, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan must contain an exhibit for financial reporting
purposes indicating the additional annual contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability and must contain an exhibit for contribution determination purposes indicating
the additional contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For the
retirement plans listed in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), but excluding the MERF division of the
Public Employees Retirement Association, the additional contribution must be calculated on a level
percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full funding in effect when the
valuation is prepared, assuming annual payroll growth at the applicable percentage rate set forth
in subdivision 8, paragraph (c). For all other retirement plans and for the MERF division of the
Public Employees Retirement Association, the additional annual contribution must be calculated
on a level annual dollar amount basis.

any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be

applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect

a break in coverage between a participant's coverage under the employment-based group insurance
program and the participant's coverage under this section. An employer shall notify an employee of
the option to participate under this paragraph no later than the effective date of retirement. The retired
employee or the employer of a participating group on behalf of a current or retired employee shall

employee participates in the program. Coverage under this clause must be coordinated with relevant
insurance benefits provided through the federally sponsored Medicare program.

plan under chapter 353G, the executive director shall credit the fire state aid against future
municipal contribution requirements under section 353G.08 and shall notify the municipality or

report with the municipality. If the relief association has not filed a financial report with the
municipality, the municipal treasurer shall delay transmission of the fire state aid to the relief
association until the complete financial report is filed. If the municipality or independent nonprofit
firefighting corporation is not covered by the voluntary statewide lump-sum volunteer firefighter
retirement plan, if there is no relief association organized, or if the association has dissolved or
has been removed as trustees of state aid, then the treasurer of the municipality shall deposit the
money in the municipal treasury and the money may be disbursed only for the purposes and in the
manner set forth in section 424A.08 or for the payment of the employer contribution requirement
with respect to firefighters covered by the public employees police and fire retirement plan under
section 353.65, subdivision 3.
    (b) The municipal treasurer, upon receipt of the police state aid, shall disburse the police state
aid in the following manner:
    (1) For a municipality in which a local police relief association exists and all peace officers
are members of the association, the total state aid must be transmitted to the treasurer of the relief
association within 30 days of the date of receipt, and the treasurer of the relief association shall
immediately deposit the total state aid in the special fund of the relief association;
    (2) For a municipality in which police retirement coverage is provided by the public employees
police and fire fund and all peace officers are members of the fund, including municipalities
covered by section 353.665, the total state aid must be applied toward the municipality's employer
contribution to the public employees police and fire fund under sections 353.65, subdivision 3, and
353.665, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), if applicable; or
    (3) For a municipality other than a city of the first class with a population of more than 300,000
in which both a police relief association exists and police retirement coverage is provided in part by
the public employees police and fire fund, the municipality may elect at its option to transmit the
total state aid to the treasurer of the relief association as provided in clause (1), to use the total state
aid to apply toward the municipality's employer contribution to the public employees police and fire
fund subject to all the provisions set forth in clause (2), or to allot the total state aid proportionately
to be transmitted to the police relief association as provided in this subdivision and to apply toward
the municipality's employer contribution to the public employees police and fire fund subject to the
provisions of clause (2) on the basis of the respective number of active full-time peace officers, as
defined in section 69.011, subdivision 1, clause (g).
    For a city of the first class with a population of more than 300,000, in addition, the city may elect
to allot the appropriate portion of the total police state aid to apply toward the employer contribution
of the city to the public employees police and fire fund based on the covered salary of police officers
covered by the fund each payroll period and to transmit the balance to the police relief association;
or
    (4) For a municipality in which police retirement coverage is provided in part by the public
employees police and fire fund and in part by a local police consolidation account governed by
chapter 353A and established before March 2, 1999, for which the municipality declined merger
under section 353.665, subdivision 1, or established after March 1, 1999, the total police state aid
must be applied towards the municipality's total employer contribution to the public employees
police and fire fund and to the local police consolidation account under sections 353.65, subdivision
3, and 353A.09, subdivision 5.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 353.03, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

                          un­d
                             ­ Association is vested in an 11-member board of trustees consisting of
ten members and the state auditor. The state auditor may designate a deputy auditor with expertise
in pension matters as the auditor's representative on the board. The governor shall appoint five
trustees to four-year terms, one of whom shall be designated to represent school boards, one
to represent cities, one to represent counties, one who is a retired annuitant, and one who is a
public member knowledgeable in pension matters. The membership of the association, including
recipients of retirement annuities and disability and survivor benefits, shall elect five trustees
for terms of four years, one of whom must be a member of the police and fire fund and one of
whom must be a former member who met the definition of public employee under section 353.01,
subdivisions 2 and 2a, for at least five years prior to terminating membership or a member who
receives a disability benefit. Terms expire on January 31 of the fourth year, and positions are vacant
until newly elected members are seated. Except as provided in this subdivision, trustees elected by
the membership of the association must be public employees and members of the association.
    (b) For seven days beginning October 1 of each year preceding a year in which an election is
held, the association shall accept at its office filings in person or by mail of candidates for the board
of trustees. A candidate shall submit at the time of filing a nominating petition signed by 25 or more
members of the association. No name may be withdrawn from nomination by the nominee after
October 15. At the request of a candidate for an elected position on the board of trustees, the board
shall mail a statement of up to 300 words prepared by the candidate to all persons eligible to vote in
the election of the candidate. The board may adopt policies, subject to review and approval by the
secretary of state under paragraph (e), to govern the form and length of these statements, timing of
mailings, and deadlines for submitting materials to be mailed. The secretary of state shall resolve
disputes between the board and a candidate concerning application of these policies to a particular
statement.
    (c) By January 10 of each year in which elections are to be held, the board shall distribute by mail
to the members ballots listing the candidates. No member may vote for more than one candidate for
each board position to be filled. A ballot indicating a vote for more than one person for any position
is void. No special marking may be used on the ballot to indicate incumbents. Ballots mailed to the
association must be postmarked no later than January 31. The ballot envelopes must be so designated
and the ballots must be counted in a manner that ensures that each vote is secret.
    (d) A candidate who receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $100, or has
given implicit or explicit consent for any other person to receive contributions or make expenditures
in excess of $100 for the purpose of bringing about the candidate's election, shall file a report with the

to the candidate's campaign. The campaign finance and public disclosure board shall prescribe forms
governing these disclosures. Expenditures and contributions have the meaning defined in section
10A.01. These terms do not include the mailing made by the association board on behalf of the
candidate. A candidate shall file a report within 30 days from the day that the results of the election
are announced. The Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board shall maintain these reports and
make them available for public inspection in the same manner as the board maintains and makes
available other reports filed with it.
    (e) The secretary of state shall review and approve the procedures defined by the board of trustees
for conducting the elections specified in this subdivision, including board policies adopted under
paragraph (b).
   (f) The board of trustees and the executive director shall undertake their activities consistent
with chapter 356A.

    Subd. 5. Minnesota deferred compensation plan transfers. A relief association may directly
transfer on an institution-to-institution basis the eligible member's lump-sum pension amount to the
requesting member's account in the Minnesota deferred compensation plan, if:
   (1) the governing articles of incorporation or bylaws so provide;
    (2) the volunteer firefighter participates in the Minnesota deferred compensation plan at the time
of retirement; and
   (3) the applicable retiring firefighter requests in writing that the relief association do so.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 424A.016, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
  Subd. 4. Individual accounts. (a) An individual account must be established for each firefighter
who is a member of the relief association.
   (b) To each individual active member account must be credited an equal share of:
   (1) any amounts of fire state aid received by the relief association;
    (2) any amounts of municipal contributions to the relief association raised from levies on real
estate or from other available municipal revenue sources exclusive of fire state aid; and
   (3) any amounts equal to the share of the assets of the special fund to the credit of:
    (i) any former member who terminated active service with the fire department to which the
relief association is associated before meeting the minimum service requirement provided for in
subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and has not returned to active service with the fire department for a
period no shorter than five years; or
    (ii) any retired member who retired before obtaining a full nonforfeitable interest in the amounts
credited to the individual member account under subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and any applicable
provision of the bylaws of the relief association. In addition, any investment return on the assets of
the special fund must be credited in proportion to the share of the assets of the special fund to the
credit of each individual active member account. Administrative expenses of the relief association
payable from the special fund may be deducted from individual accounts in a manner specified in
the bylaws of the relief association.
   (c) If the bylaws so permit and as the bylaws define, the relief association may credit any

investment return on the assets of the special fund to the accounts of inactive members.
    (d) Amounts to be credited to individual accounts must be allocated uniformly for all years of
active service and allocations must be made for all years of service, except for caps on service
credit if so provided in the bylaws of the relief association. The allocation method may utilize
monthly proration for fractional years of service, as the bylaws or articles of incorporation of the
relief association so provide. The bylaws or articles of incorporation may define a "month," but the
definition must require a calendar month to have at least 16 days of active service. If the bylaws or
articles of incorporation do not define a "month," a "month" is a completed calendar month of active
service measured from the member's date of entry to the same date in the subsequent month.

     ­­) (e) At the time of retirement under subdivision 2 and any applicable provision of the bylaws
of the relief association, a retiring member is entitled to that portion of the assets of the special

subdivision 3 and any applicable provision of the bylaws of the relief association based on the
number of years of service to the credit of the retiring member.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 424A.016, subdivision 7, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 7. Limitation on ancillary benefits. (a) A defined contribution relief association may
only pay an ancillary benefit which would constitute an authorized disbursement as specified in
section 424A.05. The ancillary benefit for active members must equal the vested ­
                                                                                o­r and nonvested
amount of the individual account of the member.
   (b) For deferred members, the ancillary benefit must equal the vested amount of the individual
account of the member. For the recipient of installment payments of a service pension, the ancillary
benefit must equal the remaining balance in the individual account of the recipient.
   (c)(1) If a survivor or death benefit is payable under the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the
benefit must be paid:
   (i) as a survivor benefit to the surviving spouse of the deceased firefighter;
   (ii) as a survivor benefit to the surviving children of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse;
   (iii) as a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary of the deceased firefighter if no surviving

    (d) For purposes of this section, for a defined contribution volunteer fire relief association, a
trust created under chapter 501B may be a designated beneficiary. If a trust payable to the surviving
children organized under chapter 501B has been established as authorized by this section and there is
no surviving spouse, the survivor benefit may be paid to the trust, notwithstanding the requirements
of this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 424A.02, subdivision 9, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 9. Limitation on ancillary benefits. A defined benefit relief association, including any
volunteer firefighters relief association governed by section 69.77 or any volunteer firefighters
division of a relief association governed by chapter 424, may only pay ancillary benefits which
would constitute an authorized disbursement as specified in section 424A.05 subject to the
following requirements or limitations:
    (1) with respect to a defined benefit relief association in which governing bylaws provide
for a lump-sum service pension to a retiring member, no ancillary benefit may be paid to any
former member or paid to any person on behalf of any former member after the former member (i)
terminates active service with the fire department and active membership in the relief association;
and (ii) commences receipt of a service pension as authorized under this section; and
    (2) with respect to any defined benefit relief association, no ancillary benefit paid or payable to
any member, to any former member, or to any person on behalf of any member or former member,
may exceed in amount the total earned service pension of the member or former member. The total
earned service pension must be calculated by multiplying the service pension amount specified in
the bylaws of the relief association at the time of death or disability, whichever applies, by the years
of service credited to the member or former member. The years of service must be determined as
of (i) the date the member or former member became entitled to the ancillary benefit; or (ii) the
date the member or former member died entitling a survivor or the estate of the member or former
member to an ancillary benefit. The ancillary benefit must be calculated without regard to whether
the member had attained the minimum amount of service and membership credit specified in the
governing bylaws. For active members, the amount of a permanent disability benefit or a survivor
benefit must be equal to the member's total earned service pension except that the bylaws of a defined
benefit relief association may provide for the payment of a survivor benefit in an amount not to
exceed five times the yearly service pension amount specified in the bylaws on behalf of any member
who dies before having performed five years of active service in the fire department with which the
relief association is affiliated.
   (3)(i) If a lump sum survivor or death benefit is payable under the articles of incorporation or
bylaws, the benefit must be paid:
   (A) as a survivor benefit to the surviving spouse of the deceased firefighter;
   (B) as a survivor benefit to the surviving children of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse;
   (C) as a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse or surviving children; or

    (D) as a death benefit to the estate of the deceased active or deferred firefighter if no surviving
children and no beneficiary designated.
    (ii) If there are no surviving children, the surviving spouse may waive, in writing, wholly or
partially, the spouse's entitlement to a survivor benefit.
    (4)(i) If a monthly benefit survivor or death benefit is payable under the articles of incorporation
or bylaws, the benefit must be paid:
   (A) as a survivor benefit to the surviving spouse of the deceased firefighter;
   (B) as a survivor benefit to the surviving children of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse;
   (C) as a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary of the deceased firefighter if no surviving
spouse or surviving children; or
   (D) as a death benefit to the estate of the deceased active or deferred firefighter if no surviving
spouse, no surviving children, and no beneficiary designated.
    (ii) If there are no surviving children, the surviving spouse may waive, in writing, wholly or
partially, the spouse's entitlement to a survivor benefit.
   (iii) For purposes of this clause, if the relief association bylaws authorize a monthly survivor
benefit payable to a designated beneficiary, the relief association bylaws may limit the total survivor
benefit amount payable.
    (5) For purposes of this section, for a monthly benefit volunteer fire relief association or for a
combination lump-sum and monthly benefit volunteer fire relief association where a monthly benefit
service pension has been elected by or a monthly benefit is payable with respect to a firefighter,
a designated beneficiary must be a natural person. For purposes of this section, for a lump-sum
volunteer fire relief association or for a combination lump-sum and monthly benefit volunteer fire
relief association where a lump-sum service pension has been elected by or a lump-sum benefit
is payable with respect to a firefighter, a trust created under chapter 501B may be a designated
beneficiary. If a trust is payable to the surviving children organized under chapter 501B as authorized
by this section and there is no surviving spouse, the survivor benefit may be paid to the trust,
notwithstanding a requirement of this section to the contrary.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 424A.02, subdivision 10, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 10. Local approval of bylaw amendments; filing requirements. (a) Each defined benefit
relief association to which this section applies must file a revised copy of its governing bylaws
with the state auditor upon the adoption of any amendment to its governing bylaws by the relief
association or upon the approval of any amendment to its governing bylaws granted by the governing
body of each municipality served by the fire department to which the relief association is directly
associated. Failure of the relief association to file a copy of the bylaws or any bylaw amendments
with the state auditor disqualifies the municipality from the distribution of any future fire state aid
until this filing requirement has been completed.

     (b) If the special fund of the relief association does not have a surplus over full funding
under section 69.772, subdivision 3, clause (2), subclause (e), or 69.773, subdivision 4, and if the
municipality is required to provide financial support to the special fund of the relief association
under section 69.772 or 69.773, no bylaw amendment which would affect the amount of, the
manner of payment of, or the conditions for qualification for service pensions or ancillary benefits
or disbursements other than administrative expenses authorized under section 69.80 payable from
the special fund of the relief association is effective until it has been ratified b                                               ­­y­­

    (c) If the relief association pays only a lump-sum pension, the financial requirements are to
be determined by the board of trustees following the preparation of an estimate of the expected
increase in the accrued liability and annual accruing liability of the relief association attributable
to the change. If the relief association pays a monthly benefit service pension, the financial
requirements are to be determined by the board of trustees following either an updated actuarial
valuation including the proposed change or an estimate of the expected actuarial impact of the
proposed change prepared by the actuary of the relief association. If a relief association adopts or
amends its articles of incorporation or bylaws without municipal ratification under this subdivision,
and, subsequent to the amendment or adoption, the financial requirements of the special fund
under this section are such so as to require financial support from the municipality, the provision
which was implemented without municipal ratification is no longer effective without municipal
ratification, and any service pensions or ancillary benefits payable after that date must be paid only
in accordance with the articles of incorporation or bylaws as amended or adopted with municipal
ratification.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

Association coverage is voided and the individual retains coverage by the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities System individual retirement account plan. If amounts were transferred under
paragraph (c) from the individual retirement account plan, those amounts must be returned to the
individual's account or accounts under that plan.

condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.

and increase infiltration for groundwater recharge. The riparian buffers must be at least 50 feet unless
there is a natural impediment, a road, or other impediment beyond the control of the landowner. This
appropriation may be used for restoration of riparian buffers protected by easements purchased with
this appropriation and for stream bank restorations when the riparian buffers have been restored. Up
to five percent may be used for administration of this program and up to five percent may be used
for technical design, construction, and project oversight.
    (c) $400,000 in fiscal year 2011 is appropriated from the clean water fund to the Board of Water
and Soil Resources for grants to watershed districts and watershed management organizations for:
(1) structural or vegetative management practices that reduce storm water runoff from developed or
disturbed lands to reduce the movement of sediment, nutrients, and pollutants or to leverage federal
funds for restoration, protection, or enhancement of water quality in lakes, rivers, and streams and
to protect groundwater and drinking water; and (2) the installation of proven and effective water
retention practices including, but not limited to, rain gardens and other vegetated infiltration basins
and sediment control basins in order to keep water on the land. The projects must be of long-lasting
public benefit, include a local match, and be consistent with TMDL implementation plans or local
water management plans. Watershed district and watershed management organization staff and
administration may be used for the local match. Priority may be given to school projects that can be
used to demonstrate water retention practices. Up to five percent may be used for administering the
grants and up to five percent may be used for technical design, construction, and project oversight.
    (d) $300,000 in fiscal year 2011 is appropriated from the clean water fund to the Board of
Water and Soil Resources for permanent conservation easements on wellhead protection areas
under Minnesota Statutes, section 103F.515, subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Priority must be placed
on land that is located where the vulnerability of the drinking water supply management area, as
defined under Minnesota Rules, part 4720.5100, subpart 13, is designated as high or very high by
the commissioner of health. Up to five percent may be used for administration of this program and
up to five percent may be used for technical design, construction, and project oversight.
   (e) The appropriations in fiscal year 2011 to the Board of Water and Soil Resources in Laws 2009,
chapter 172, article 2, section 6, are available until June 30, 2012, and, unless otherwise specified,
may utilize up to five percent for administration of grant and easement programs and up to five
percent for technical design, construction, and project oversight.

or program must be consistent with current scholarship, or best practices, when appropriate and
incorporate state-of-the-art technology when appropriate.
    (b) Funding from the arts and cultural heritage fund may be granted for an entire project or for
part of a project so long as the recipient provides a description and cost for the entire project and
can demonstrate that it has adequate resources to ensure that the entire project will be completed.
    (c) Money from the arts and cultural heritage fund shall be expended for benefits across all
regions and residents of the state.

sale of tracts of state timber made pursuant to section 90.101;
    (2) no bidder may be awarded more than 25 percent of the total tracts offered at the first round
of bidding unless fewer than four tracts are offered, in which case not more than one tract shall
be awarded to one bidder. Any tract not sold at public auction may be offered for private sale as
authorized by section 90.101, subdivision 1, to persons eligible under this section at the appraised
value; and
    (3) no sale may be made to a person having more than 2
                                                         ­­0 30 employees. For the purposes of this
clause, "employee" means an individual working in the timber or wood products industry for salary
or wages on a full-time or part-time basis.
    (b) The auction sale procedure set forth in this section constitutes an additional alternative timber
sale procedure available to the commissioner and is not intended to replace other authority possessed
by the commissioner to sell timber in lots of 3,000 cords or less.
    (c) Another bidder or the commissioner may request that the number of employees a bidder
has pursuant to paragraph (a), clause (3), be confirmed if there is evidence that the bidder may be
ineligible due to exceeding the employee threshold. The commissioner shall request information
from the commissioners of labor and industry and employment and economic development
including the premiums paid by the bidder in question for workers' compensation insurance
coverage for all employees of the bidder. The commissioner shall review the information submitted
by the commissioners of labor and industry and employment and economic development and
make a determination based on that information as to whether the bidder is eligible. A bidder is
considered eligible and may participate in intermediate auctions until determined ineligible under
this paragraph.

   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 90.14, is amended to read:
   90.14 AUCTION SALE PROCEDURE.
   (a) All state timber shall be offered and sold by the same unit of measurement as it was appraised.
No tract shall be sold to any person other than the purchaser in whose name the bid was made. The
commissioner may refuse to approve any and all bids received and cancel a sale of state timber for
good and sufficient reasons.
    (b) The purchaser at any sale of timber shall, immediately upon the approval of the bid, or,
if unsold at public auction, at the time of purchase at a subsequent sale under section 90.101,
subdivision 1, pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the appraised value. In
case any purchaser fails to make such payment, the purchaser shall be liable therefor to the state in
a civil action, and the commissioner may reoffer the timber for sale as though no bid or sale under
section 90.101, subdivision 1, therefor had been made.
    (c) In lieu of the scaling of state timber required by this chapter, a purchaser of state timber may,
at the time of payment by the purchaser to the commissioner of 15 percent of the appraised value,
elect in writing on a form prescribed by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the
appraiser's estimate of the volume of timber described in the permit, provided that the commissioner
has expressly designated the availability of such option for that tract on the list of tracts available
for sale as required under section 90.101. A purchaser who elects in writing on a form prescribed

by the attorney general to purchase a permit based solely on the appraiser's estimate of the volume
of timber described on the permit does not have recourse to the provisions of section 90.281.
    (d) In the case of a public auction sale conducted by a sealed bid process, tracts shall be
awarded to the high bidder, who shall pay to the commissioner a down payment of 15 percent of the
appraised value w­­t

    Sec. 48. [103A.212] WATERSHED MANAGEMENT POLICY.
    The quality of life of every Minnesotan depends on water. Minnesota's rivers, lakes, streams,
wetlands, and groundwater provide a foundation for drinking water and the state's recreational,
municipal, commercial, industrial, agricultural, environmental, aesthetic, and economic well-being.
The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to manage groundwater and surface water
resources from the perspective of aquifers, watersheds, and river basins to achieve protection,
preservation, enhancement, and restoration of the state's valuable groundwater and surface water
resources.

wetlands under Laws 1979, chapter 199, as public waters or as wetlands under section 103G.005,
subdivision 19. The commissioner may only reclassify public waters wetlands as public waters if:
   (1) they are assigned a shoreland management classification by the commissioner under sections
103F.201 to 103F.221;
   (2) they are classified as lacustrine wetlands or deepwater habitats according to Classification of
Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States (Cowardin, et al., 1979 edition); or
    (3) the state or federal government has become titleholder to any of the beds or shores of the
public waters wetlands, subsequent to the preparation of the public waters inventory map filed with
the auditor of the county, pursuant to paragraph (a), and the responsible state or federal agency
declares that the water is necessary for the purposes of the public ownership.
    (c) The commissioner must provide notice of the reclassification to the local government unit,
the county board, the watershed district, if one exists for the area, and the soil and water conservation
district. Within 60 days of receiving notice from the commissioner, a party required to receive
the notice may provide a resolution stating objections to the reclassification. If the commissioner
receives an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the reclassification is not effective.
If the commissioner does not receive an objection from a party required to receive the notice, the
reclassification of a wetland under paragraph (b) is effective 60 days after the notice is received by
all of the parties.
    (d) The commissioner shall give priority to the reclassification of public waters wetlands that
are or have the potential to be affected by public works projects.

APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Monitoring equipment. The commissioner may require the installation
and maintenance of monitoring equipment to evaluate water resource impacts from permitted
appropriations and proposed projects that require a permit. Monitoring for water resources that
supply more than one appropriator must be designed to minimize costs to individual appropriators.
    Subd. 2. Measuring devices required. Monitoring installations required under subdivision 1
must be equipped with automated measuring devices to measure water levels, flows, or conditions.
The commissioner may determine the frequency of measurements and other measuring methods
based on the quantity of water appropriated or used, the source of water, potential connections to
other water resources, the method of appropriating or using water, seasonal and long-term changes
in water levels, and any other facts supplied to the commissioner.
   Subd. 3. Reports and costs. (a) Records of water measurements under subdivision 2 must be
kept for each installation. The measurements must be reported annually to the commissioner on or
before February 15 of the following year in a format or on forms prescribed by the commissioner.
    (b) The owner or person in charge of an installation for appropriating or using waters of the state
or a proposal that requires a permit is responsible for all costs related to establishing and maintaining
monitoring installations and to measuring and reporting data. Monitoring costs for water resources
that supply more than one appropriator may be distributed among all users within a monitoring
area determined by the commissioner and assessed based on volumes of water appropriated and
proximity to resources of concern.

   Subdivision 1. Applications for groundwater appropriations. (a) Groundwater use permit
applications are not complete until the applicant has supplied:
    (1) a water well record as required by section 103I.205, subdivision 9, information on the
subsurface geologic formations penetrated by the well and the formation or aquifer that will serve
as the water source, and geologic information from test holes drilled to locate the site of the
production well;
   (2) the maximum daily, seasonal, and annual pumpage rates and volumes being requested;
    (3) information on groundwater quality in terms of the measures of quality commonly specified
for the proposed water use and details on water treatment necessary for the proposed use;
    (4) an inventory of existing wells within 1-1/2 miles of the proposed production well or within
the area of influence, as determined by the commissioner. The inventory must include information on
well locations, depths, geologic formations, depth of the pump or intake, pumping and nonpumping
water levels, and details of well construction; and
   (5) the results of an aquifer test completed according to specifications approved by the
commissioner. The test must be conducted at the maximum pumping rate requested in the
application and for a length of time adequate to assess or predict impacts to other wells and surface
water and groundwater resources. The permit applicant is responsible for all costs related to the
aquifer test, including the construction of groundwater and surface water monitoring installations,
and water level readings before, during, and after the aquifer test.
    (b) The commissioner may waive an application requirement in this subdivision if the
information provided with the application is adequate to determine whether the proposed
appropriation and use of water is sustainable and will protect ecosystems, water quality, and the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
   Subd. 2. Relationship to surface water resources. Groundwater appropriations that have
potential impacts to surface waters are subject to applicable provisions in section 103G.285.
   Subd. 3. Protection of groundwater supplies. The commissioner may establish water
appropriation limits to protect groundwater resources. When establishing water appropriation
limits to protect groundwater resources, the commissioner must consider the sustainability of the
groundwater resource, including the current and projected water levels, water quality, whether the
use protects ecosystems, and the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
    Subd. 4. Groundwater management areas. The commissioner may designate groundwater
management areas and limit total annual water appropriations and uses within a designated area
to ensure sustainable use of groundwater that protects ecosystems, water quality, and the ability
of future generations to meet their own needs. Water appropriations and uses within a designated
management area must be consistent with a plan approved by the commissioner that addresses water
conservation requirements and water allocation priorities established in section 103G.261.
    Subd. 5. Interference with other wells. The commissioner may issue water use permits for
appropriation from groundwater only if the commissioner determines that the groundwater use is
sustainable to supply the needs of future generations and the proposed use will not harm ecosystems,
degrade water, or reduce water levels beyond the reach of public water supply and private domestic
wells constructed according to Minnesota Rules, chapter 4725.

    Subd. 2. Fees. (a) The commissioner shall establish a fee schedule for permits to control or
harvest aquatic plants other than wild rice. The fees must be set by rule, and section 16A.1283 does
not apply, but the rule must not take effect until 45 legislative days after it has been reported to the
legislature. The fees shall be based upon the cost of receiving, processing, analyzing, and issuing
the permit, and additional costs incurred after the application to inspect and monitor the activities
authorized by the permit, and enforce aquatic plant management rules and permit requirements.
   (b) A fee for a permit for the control of rooted aquatic vegetation for each contiguous parcel of
shoreline owned by an owner may be charged. This fee may not be charged for permits issued in
connection with purple loosestrife control or lakewide Eurasian water milfoil control programs.
    (c) A fee may not be charged to the state or a federal governmental agency applying for a permit.
   (d) A fee for a permit for the control of rooted aquatic vegetation in a public water basin that is
20 acres or less in size shall be one-half of the fee established under paragraph (a).
   (e) The money received for the permits under this subdivision shall be deposited in the treasury
and credited to the water recreation account.

   The commissioner of natural resources must not issue leases to remove sunken logs or issue
permits for the removal of sunken logs from public waters.
    Sec. 62. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 115.55, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 13. Subsurface sewage treatment systems implementation and enforcement task
force. (a) By September 1, 2010, the agency shall appoint a subsurface sewage treatment systems
implementation and enforcement task force in collaboration with the Association of Minnesota
Counties, Minnesota Association of Realtors, Minnesota Association of County Planning and
Zoning Administrators, and the Minnesota Onsite Wastewater Association. The agency shall
work in collaboration with the task force to develop effective and timely implementation and
enforcement methods in order to rapidly reduce the number of subsurface sewage treatment
systems that are an imminent threat to public health or safety and effectively enforce all violations
of the subsurface sewage treatment system rules. The agency shall meet at least three times per
year with the task force to address implementation and enforcement issues. The meetings shall be
scheduled so that they do not interfere with the construction season.
   (b) The agency, in collaboration with the task force and in consultation with the attorney general,
county attorneys, and county planning and zoning staff, shall develop, periodically update, and
provide to counties enforcement protocols and a checklist that county inspectors, field staff, and
others may use when inspecting subsurface sewage treatment systems and enforcing subsurface
sewage treatment system rules.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
103RD DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                         11413

   Sec. 63. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116.07, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Rules and standards. (a) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the
provisions hereof, the Pollution Control Agency may adopt, amend and rescind rules and standards
having the force of law relating to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1967, chapter 882, for
the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general
application throughout the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances, or conditions
in order to make due allowance for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may
relate to sources or emissions of air contamination or air pollution, to the quality or composition of
such emissions, or to the quality of or composition of the ambient air or outdoor atmosphere or to
any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution.
     (b) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions hereof, the Pollution
Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1969, chapter 1046, for the collection, transportation,
storage, processing, and disposal of solid waste and the prevention, abatement, or control of water,
air, and land pollution which may be related thereto, and the deposit in or on land of any other
material that may tend to cause pollution. The agency shall adopt such rules and standards for sewage
sludge, addressing the intrinsic suitability of land, the volume and rate of application of sewage
sludge of various degrees of intrinsic hazard, design of facilities, and operation of facilities and sites.
Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or may be limited as
to times, places, circumstances, or conditions in order to make due allowance for variations therein.
Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to collection, transportation, processing, disposal,
equipment, location, procedures, methods, systems or techniques or to any other matter relevant to
the prevention, abatement or control of water, air, and land pollution which may be advised through
the control of collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge,
and the deposit in or on land of any other material that may tend to cause pollution. By January 1,
1983, the rules for the management of sewage sludge shall include an analysis of the sewage sludge
determined by the commissioner of agriculture to be necessary to meet the soil amendment labeling
requirements of section 18C.215.
    (c) The rules for the disposal of solid waste shall include site-specific criteria to prohibit solid
waste disposal based on the area's sensitivity to groundwater contamination, including site-specific
testing. The rules shall provide criteria for locating landfills based on a site's sensitivity to
groundwater contamination. Sensitivity to groundwater contamination is based on the predicted
minimum time of travel of groundwater contaminants from the solid waste to the compliance
boundary. The rules shall prohibit landfills in areas where karst is likely to develop. The rules shall
specify testable or otherwise objective thresholds for these criteria. The rules shall also include
modifications to financial assurance requirements under subdivision 4h that ensure the state is
protected from financial responsibility for future groundwater contamination. The modifications
to the financial assurance rules specified in this paragraph must require that a solid waste disposal
facility subject to them maintain financial assurance so long as the facility poses a potential
environmental risk to human health, wildlife, or the environment, as determined by the agency
following an empirical assessment. The financial assurance and siting modifications to the rules
specified in this paragraph do not apply to:
   (1) solid waste facilities initially permitted before January 1, 2011, including future contiguous
expansions and noncontiguous expansions within 600 yards of a permitted boundary;
11414                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [103RD DAY

    (2) solid waste disposal facilities that accept only construction and demolition debris and
incidental nonrecyclable packaging, and facilities that accept only industrial waste that is limited
to wood, concrete, porcelain fixtures, shingles, or window glass resulting from the manufacture of
construction materials; and
   (3) requirements for permit by rule solid waste disposal facilities.
     (d) Until the rules are modified as provided in paragraph (c) to include site-specific criteria to
prohibit areas from solid waste disposal due to groundwater contamination sensitivity, as required
under this section, the agency shall not issue a permit for a new solid waste disposal facility, except
for:
   (1) the reissuance of a permit for a land disposal facility operating as of March 1, 2008;
    (2) a permit to expand a land disposal facility operating as of March 1, 2008, beyond its permitted
boundaries, including expansion on land that is not contiguous to, but is located within 600 yards
of, the land disposal facility's permitted boundaries;
    (3) a permit to modify the type of waste accepted at a land disposal facility operating as of March
1, 2008;
   (4) a permit to locate a disposal facility that accepts only construction debris as defined in section
115A.03, subdivision 7;
   (5) a permit to locate a disposal facility that:
    (i) accepts boiler ash from an electric energy power plant that has wet scrubbed units or has units
that have been converted from wet scrubbed units to dry scrubbed units as those terms are defined
in section 216B.68;
   (ii) is on land that was owned on May 1, 2008, by the utility operating the electric energy power
plant; and
   (iii) is located within three miles of the existing ash disposal facility for the power plant; or
   (6) a permit to locate a new solid waste disposal facility for ferrous metallic minerals regulated
under Minnesota Rules, chapter 6130, or for nonferrous metallic minerals regulated under
Minnesota Rules, chapter 6132.
    (e) Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions hereof, the Pollution
Control Agency may adopt, amend and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1971, chapter 727, for the prevention, abatement,
or control of noise pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout
the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances or conditions in order to make due
allowances for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to sources
or emissions of noise or noise pollution, to the quality or composition of noises in the natural
environment, or to any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of noise
pollution.
   (f) As to any matters subject to this chapter, local units of government may set emission
regulations with respect to stationary sources which are more stringent than those set by the
Pollution Control Agency.
103RD DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                         11415

    (g) Pursuant to chapter 14, the Pollution Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules
and standards having the force of law relating to any purpose within the provisions of this chapter
for generators of hazardous waste, the management, identification, labeling, classification, storage,
collection, treatment, transportation, processing, and disposal of hazardous waste and the location of
hazardous waste facilities. A rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or
may be limited as to time, places, circumstances, or conditions. In implementing its hazardous waste
rules, the Pollution Control Agency shall give high priority to providing planning and technical
assistance to hazardous waste generators. The agency shall assist generators in investigating the
availability and feasibility of both interim and long-term hazardous waste management methods.
The methods shall include waste reduction, waste separation, waste processing, resource recovery,
and temporary storage.
   (h) The Pollution Control Agency shall give highest priority in the consideration of permits to
authorize disposal of diseased shade trees by open burning at designated sites to evidence concerning
economic costs of transportation and disposal of diseased shade trees by alternative methods.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116.07, subdivision 4h, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4h. Financial responsibility rules. (a) The agency shall adopt rules requiring the operator
or owner of a solid waste disposal facility to submit to the agency proof of the operator's or owner's
financial capability to provide reasonable and necessary response during the operating life of the
facility and for 30 years after closure for a mixed municipal solid waste disposal facility or for a
minimum of 20 years after closure, as determined by agency rules, for any other solid waste disposal
facility, and to provide for the closure of the facility and postclosure care required under agency
rules. Proof of financial responsibility is required of the operator or owner of a facility receiving an
original permit or a permit for expansion after adoption of the rules. Within 180 days of the effective
date of the rules or by July 1, 1987, whichever is later, proof of financial responsibility is required
of an operator or owner of a facility with a remaining capacity of more than five years or 500,000
cubic yards that is in operation at the time the rules are adopted. Compliance with the rules and the
requirements of paragraph (b) is a condition of obtaining or retaining a permit to operate the facility.
    (b) A municipality, as defined in section 475.51, subdivision 2, including a sanitary district, that
owns or operates a solid waste disposal facility that was in operation on May 15, 1989, may meet its
financial responsibility for all or a portion of the contingency action portion of the reasonable and
necessary response costs at the facility by pledging its full faith and credit to meet its responsibility.
    The pledge must be made in accordance with the requirements in chapter 475 for issuing bonds
of the municipality, and the following additional requirements:
    (1) The governing body of the municipality shall enact an ordinance that clearly accepts
responsibility for the costs of contingency action at the facility and that reserves, during the
operating life of the facility and for the time period required in paragraph (a) after closure, a portion
of the debt limit of the municipality, as established under section 475.53 or other law, that is equal
to the total contingency action costs.
   (2) The municipality shall require that all collectors that haul to the facility implement a plan for
reducing solid waste by using volume-based pricing, recycling incentives, or other means.
11416                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [103RD DAY

    (3) When a municipality opts to meet a portion of its financial responsibility by relying on its
authority to issue bonds, it shall also begin setting aside in a dedicated long-term care trust fund
money that will cover a portion of the potential contingency action costs at the facility, the amount
to be determined by the agency for each facility based on at least the amount of waste deposited in
the disposal facility each year, and the likelihood and potential timing of conditions arising at the
facility that will necessitate response action. The agency may not require a municipality to set aside
more than five percent of the total cost in a single year.
   (4) A municipality shall have and consistently maintain an investment grade bond rating as a
condition of using bonding authority to meet financial responsibility under this section.
    (5) The municipality shall file with the commissioner of revenue its consent to have the amount
of its contingency action costs deducted from state aid payments otherwise due the municipality
and paid instead to the remediation fund created in section 116.155, if the municipality fails to
conduct the contingency action at the facility when ordered by the agency. If the agency notifies the
commissioner that the municipality has failed to conduct contingency action when ordered by the
agency, the commissioner shall deduct the amounts indicated by the agency from the state aids in
accordance with the consent filed with the commissioner.
   (6) The municipality shall file with the agency written proof that it has complied with the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (c) The method for proving financial responsibility under paragraph (b) may not be applied to
a new solid waste disposal facility or to expansion of an existing facility, unless the expansion is
a vertical expansion. Vertical expansions of qualifying existing facilities cannot be permitted for a
duration of longer than three years.
    (d) The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of management and budget for
guidance on the forms of financial assurance that are acceptable for private owners and public
owners, and in carrying out a periodic review of the adequacy of financial assurance for solid waste
disposal facilities. Financial assurance rules shall allow financial mechanisms to public owners of
solid waste disposal facilities that are appropriate to their status as subdivisions of the state.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 65. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116D.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. When prepared. Where there is potential for significant environmental effects
resulting from any major governmental action, the action shall be preceded by a detailed
environmental impact statement prepared by the responsible governmental unit. The environmental
impact statement shall be an analytical rather than an encyclopedic document which describes the
proposed action in detail, analyzes its significant environmental impacts, discusses appropriate
alternatives to the proposed action and their impacts, and explores methods by which adverse
environmental impacts of an action could be mitigated. The environmental impact statement shall
also analyze those economic, employment and sociological effects that cannot be avoided should
the action be implemented. To ensure its use in the decision-making process, the environmental
impact statement shall be prepared as early as practical in the formulation of an action. No
mandatory environmental impact statement may be required for an ethanol plant, as defined in
section 41A.09, subdivision 2a, paragraph (b), that produces less than 125,000,000 gallons of
ethanol annually and is located outside of the seven-county metropolitan area.
103RD DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                       11417

    (a) The board shall by rule establish categories of actions for which environmental impact
statements and for which environmental assessment worksheets shall be prepared as well as
categories of actions for which no environmental review is required under this section.
    (b) The responsible governmental unit shall promptly publish notice of the completion of
an environmental assessment worksheet in a manner to be determined by the board and shall
provide copies of the environmental assessment worksheet to the board and its member agencies.
Comments on the need for an environmental impact statement may be submitted to the responsible
governmental unit during a 30 day period following publication of the notice that an environmental
assessment worksheet has been completed. The responsible governmental unit's decision on the
need for an environmental impact statement shall be based on the environmental assessment
worksheet and the comments received during the comment period, and shall be made within 15
days after the close of the comment period. The board's chair may extend the 15 day period by not
more than 15 additional days upon the request of the responsible governmental unit.
    (c) An environmental assessment worksheet shall also be prepared for a proposed action
whenever material evidence accompanying a petition by not less than 25 individuals, submitted
before the proposed project has received final approval by the appropriate governmental units,
demonstrates that, because of the nature or location of a proposed action, there may be potential
for significant environmental effects. Petitions requesting the preparation of an environmental
assessment worksheet shall be submitted to the board. The chair of the board shall determine the
appropriate responsible governmental unit and forward the petition to it. A decision on the need
for an environmental assessment worksheet shall be made by the responsible governmental unit
within 15 days after the petition is received by the responsible governmental unit. The board's chair
may extend the 15 day period by not more than 15 additional days upon request of the responsible
governmental unit.
   (d) Except in an environmentally sensitive location where Minnesota Rules, part 4410.4300,
subpart 29, item B, applies, the proposed action is exempt from environmental review under this
chapter and rules of the board, if:
   (1) the proposed action is:
   (i) an animal feedlot facility with a capacity of less than 1,000 animal units; or
   (ii) an expansion of an existing animal feedlot facility with a total cumulative capacity of less
than 1,000 animal units;
    (2) the application for the animal feedlot facility includes a written commitment by the proposer
to design, construct, and operate the facility in full compliance with Pollution Control Agency
feedlot rules; and
    (3) the county board holds a public meeting for citizen input at least ten business days prior
to the Pollution Control Agency or county issuing a feedlot permit for the animal feedlot facility
unless another public meeting for citizen input has been held with regard to the feedlot facility to be
permitted. The exemption in this paragraph is in addition to other exemptions provided under other
law and rules of the board.
   (e) The board may, prior to final approval of a proposed project, require preparation of an
environmental assessment worksheet by a responsible governmental unit selected by the board for
11418                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [103RD DAY

any action where environmental review under this section has not been specifically provided for by
rule or otherwise initiated.
    (f) An early and open process shall be utilized to limit the scope of the environmental impact
statement to a discussion of those impacts, which, because of the nature or location of the project,
have the potential for significant environmental effects. The same process shall be utilized to
determine the form, content and level of detail of the statement as well as the alternatives which
are appropriate for consideration in the statement. In addition, the permits which will be required
for the proposed action shall be identified during the scoping process. Further, the process shall
identify those permits for which information will be developed concurrently with the environmental
impact statement. The board shall provide in its rules for the expeditious completion of the scoping
process. The determinations reached in the process shall be incorporated into the order requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (g) The responsible governmental unit shall, to the extent practicable, avoid duplication and
ensure coordination between state and federal environmental review and between environmental
review and environmental permitting. Whenever practical, information needed by a governmental
unit for making final decisions on permits or other actions required for a proposed project shall be
developed in conjunction with the preparation of an environmental impact statement.
    (h) An environmental impact statement shall be prepared and its adequacy determined within
280 days after notice of its preparation unless the time is extended by consent of the parties or
by the governor for good cause. The responsible governmental unit shall determine the adequacy
of an environmental impact statement, unless within 60 days after notice is published that an
environmental impact statement will be prepared, the board chooses to determine the adequacy of
an environmental impact statement. If an environmental impact statement is found to be inadequate,
the responsible governmental unit shall have 60 days to prepare an adequate environmental impact
statement.
   Sec. 66. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 116D.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Customized environmental assessment worksheet forms; electronic submission.
(a) The commissioners of natural resources and the Pollution Control Agency and the board shall
periodically review mandatory environmental assessment worksheet categories under rules adopted
under this section, and other project types that are frequently subject to environmental review, and
develop customized environmental assessment worksheet forms for the category or project type.
The forms must include specific questions that focus on key environmental issues for the category
or project type. In assessing categories and project types and developing forms, the board shall seek
the input of governmental units that are frequently responsible for the preparation of a worksheet
for the particular category or project type. The commissioners and the board shall also seek input
from the general public on the development of customized forms. The commissioners and board
shall make the customized forms available online.
    (b) The commissioners of natural resources and the Pollution Control Agency shall allow for
the electronic submission of environmental assessment worksheets and permits.

    The state pledges and agrees with all contributors to the nongame wildlife management account
to use the funds contributed solely for the management of nongame wildlife projects and further
agrees that it will not impose additional conditions or restrictions that will limit or otherwise restrict
the ability of the commissioner of natural resources to use the available funds for the most efficient
and effective management of nongame wildlife. The commissioner may use funds appropriated for
nongame wildlife programs for the purpose of developing, preserving, restoring, and maintaining
wintering habitat for neotropical migrant birds in Latin America and the Caribbean under agreement
or contract with any nonprofit organization dedicated to the construction, maintenance, and repair of
such projects that are acceptable to the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the land and
water affected by the projects. Under this authority, the commissioner may execute agreements and
contracts if the commissioner determines that the use of the funds will benefit neotropical migrant
birds that breed in or migrate through the state.

    Subd. 14. Low-income electric rate discount. A public utility shall fund an affordability
program for low-income customers in an amount based on a 50 percent electric rate discount
on the first ­30
               ­­0 400 kilowatt-hours consumed in a billing period for low-income residential
customers of the utility. For the purposes of this subdivision, "low-income" describes a customer
who is receiving assistance from the federal low-income home energy assistance program. The
affordability program must be designed to target participating customers with the lowest incomes
and highest energy costs in order to lower the percentage of income they devote to energy bills,
increase their payments, and lower costs associated with collection activities on their accounts. For
low-income customers who are 62 years of age or older or disabled, the program must, in addition
to any other program benefits, include a 50 percent electric rate discount on the first 3   ­0
                                                                                             ­0­ 400
kilowatt-hours consumed in a billing period. For the purposes of this subdivision, "public utility"
includes only those public utilities with more than 200,000 residential electric service customers.

pay as a factor in setting utility rates and may establish affordability programs for low-income
residential ratepayers in order to ensure affordable, reliable, and continuous service to low-income
utility customers. Affordability programs may include inverted block rates in which lower energy
prices are made available to lower usage customers. By September 1, 2007, a public utility serving
low-income residential ratepayers who use natural gas for heating must file an affordability program
with the commission. For purposes of this subdivision, "low-income residential ratepayers" means
ratepayers who receive energy assistance from the low-income home energy assistance program
(LIHEAP).
   (b) Any affordability program the commission orders a utility to implement must:
    (1) lower the percentage of income that participating low-income households devote to energy
bills;
   (2) increase participating customer payments over time by increasing the frequency of payments;
   (3) decrease or eliminate participating customer arrears;
   (4) lower the utility costs associated with customer account collection activities; and
   (5) coordinate the program with other available low-income bill payment assistance and
conservation resources.
   (c) In ordering affordability programs, the commission may require public utilities to file
program evaluations that measure the effect of the affordability program on:
   (1) the percentage of income that participating households devote to energy bills;
   (2) service disconnections; and
   (3) frequency of customer payments, utility collection costs, arrearages, and bad debt.
    (d) The commission must issue orders necessary to implement, administer, and evaluate
affordability programs, and to allow a utility to recover program costs, including administrative

costs, on a timely basis. The commission may not allow a utility to recover administrative costs,
excluding start-up costs, in excess of five percent of total program costs, or program evaluation
costs in excess of two percent of total program costs. The commission must permit deferred
accounting, with carrying costs, for recovery of program costs incurred during the period between
general rate cases.
   (e) Public utilities may use information collected or created for the purpose of administering
energy assistance to administer affordability programs.
  Sec. 7. [216B.1695] ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS; ADVANCE DETERMINATION

    Subd. 2. Regulatory cost assessments and reports. A utility requesting an advance
determination under subdivision 1 must, as part of the evidence required when filing a petition under
subdivision 3, provide to the Public Utilities Commission and the Pollution Control Agency an
assessment of all anticipated state and federal environmental regulations related to the production
of electricity from the utility's facility subject to the filing, including regulations relating to:
    (1) air pollution by nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide, including an assumption that Minnesota
will be included in the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule region, hazardous air pollutants, carbon
dioxide, particulates, and ozone;
   (2) coal waste; and
   (3) water consumption and water pollution.
    In addition, the utility shall provide an assessment of the financial and operational impacts of
these pending regulations applicable to the generating facility that is the subject of the filing and
provide a range of regulatory response scenarios that include, but are not limited to:
   (1) the installation of pollution control equipment;
    (2) the benefits of the retirement or repowering of the plant that is the subject of the filing with
cleaner fuels considering the costs of complying with state and federal environmental regulations;
and
   (3) the use of pollution allowances to achieve compliance.
    The utility shall consult with interested stakeholders in establishing the scope of the regulatory,
financial, and operational assessments prior to or during the 60-day period of the notice under

evidence supporting the project's reasonableness, a discussion of project alternatives, a project
implementation schedule, a cost estimate and support for the reasonableness of the estimated cost,
and a description of the public utility's efforts to ensure the lowest reasonable costs. Following
receipt of the Pollution Control Agency's verification under subdivision 4, the commission shall
allow opportunity for oral and written comment on the petition. The commission shall make a
final determination on the petition within ten months of its filing date. The commission must make
findings in support of its determination.
   Subd. 4. Verification. At least 60 days prior to filing a petition to the commission under
subdivision 3, the utility shall file notice with the Pollution Control Agency that describes the
project and how it qualifies under subdivision 1. The Pollution Control Agency shall, within 60
days of receipt of the notice, verify that the project qualifies under subdivision 1, and shall forward
written verification to the commission.
    Subd. 5. Cost recovery. The utility may begin recovery of costs that have been incurred by the
utility in connection with implementation of the project in the next rate case following an advance
determination of prudence. The commission shall review the costs incurred by the utility for the
project. The utility must show that the project costs are reasonable and necessary, and demonstrate
its efforts to ensure the lowest reasonable project costs. Notwithstanding the commission's prior
determination of prudence, it may accept, modify, or reject any of the project costs. The commission
may determine whether to require an allowance for funds used during construction offset.
   Subd. 6. Expiration. A petition for an advance determination of prudence may not be filed after
December 31, 2015.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

 Payment 4                 August 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all aid
                           entitlements except state paid property tax credits
 Payment 6                 September 30: 40 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                           aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits
 Payment 8                 October 30: 30 percent of the final adjustment for the prior fiscal year for all
                           aid entitlements except state paid property tax credits

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective immediately and applies retroactively to fiscal
year 2010 and later.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.45, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7b. Advance final payment. (a) Notwithstanding subdivisions 3 and 7, a school district
or charter school exceeding its expenditure limitations under section 123B.83 as of June 30 of the
prior fiscal year may receive a portion of its final payment for the current fiscal year on June 20, if
requested by the district or charter school. The amount paid under this subdivision must not exceed
the lesser of:
    (1) the difference between 90 percent and the current year payment percentage in subdivision
2, paragraph (d), in the current fiscal year times the sum of the district or charter school's general
education aid plus the aid adjustment in section 127A.50 for the current fiscal year; or
    (2) the amount by which the district's or charter school's net negative unreserved general fund
balance as of June 30 of the prior fiscal year exceeds 2.5 percent of the district or charter school's
expenditures for that fiscal year.
    (b) The state total advance final payment under this subdivision for any year must not exceed
$7,500,000. If the amount request exceeds $7,500,000, the advance final payment for each eligible
district must be reduced proportionately.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective immediately and applies retroactively to fiscal
year 2010 and later.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.45, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
     Subd. 13. Aid payment percentage. Except as provided in subdivisions 11, 12, 12a, and 14,
each fiscal year, all education aids and credits in this chapter and chapters 120A, 120B, 121A, 122A,
123A, 123B, 124D, 125A, 125B, 126C, 134, and section 273.1392, shall be paid at the current year
aid payment percentage of the estimated entitlement during the fiscal year of the entitlement. F                                      ­o­­r

network from the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program;
  (2) premiums from Medicare wrap-around subscribers for health benefits which supplement
Medicare coverage;
    (3) Medicare revenue, as a result of an arrangement between a health maintenance organization

merges or consolidates with or is acquired by another health maintenance organization or
community integrated service network, the surviving corporation or the new corporation shall be
responsible for the annual surcharge originally imposed on each of the entities or corporations
subject to the merger, consolidation, or acquisition, regardless of whether one of the entities or
corporations does not retain a certificate of authority under chapter 62D or a license under chapter

entities or corporations subject to the merger, consolidation, or acquisition regardless of whether
one of the entities or corporations does not retain a certificate of authority under chapter 62D or a
license under chapter 62N until the total premium revenues of the surviving corporation include
the total premium revenues of all the merged entities as reported to the commissioner of health.

converts its licensure to a different type of entity subject to liability for the surcharge under this
chapter, but survives in the same or substantially similar form, the surviving entity remains liable
for the surcharge regardless of whether one of the entities or corporations does not retain a certificate
of authority under chapter 62D or a license under chapter 62N.

service network ends when the entity ceases providing services for premiums and the cessation is
not connected with a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or conversion.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the

    (3) be practicing in an ambulatory care setting as part of a multidisciplinary team or have
developed a structured patient care process that is offered in a private or semiprivate patient care
area that is separate from the commercial business that also occurs in the setting, or in home settings,

management program for patients identified by the commissioner with multiple chronic conditions
and a high number of medications who are at high risk of preventable hospitalizations, emergency
room use, medication complications, and suboptimal treatment outcomes due to medication-related
problems. For purposes of the pilot project, medication therapy management services may be
provided in a patient's home or community setting, in addition to other authorized settings. The
commissioner may waive existing payment policies and establish special payment rates for the
pilot project. The pilot project must be designed to produce a net savings to the state compared to

   (f) When a MinnesotaCare enrollee becomes a member of a prepaid health plan, or changes
from one prepaid health plan to another during a calendar year, any charges submitted towards the

      Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.11, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Enrollees 18 or older. Payment by the MinnesotaCare program for inpatient hospital

qualify under section 256L.04, subdivisions 1 and 2, with family gross income that exceeds 175
percent of the federal poverty guidelines and who are not pregnant, who are 18 years old or older
on the date of admission to the inpatient hospital must be in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b).
Payment for adults who are not pregnant and are eligible under section 256L.04, subdivisions 1 and
2, and whose incomes are equal to or less than 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, shall
be as provided for under paragraph (c).
    (a) If the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment required under section 256L.03,
subdivision 4, is less than or equal to the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit under
section 256L.03, subdivision 3, payment must be the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment
required under section 256L.03, subdivision 4. The hospital must not seek payment from the
enrollee in addition to the co-payment. The MinnesotaCare payment plus the co-payment must be
treated as payment in full.
   (b) If the medical assistance rate minus any co-payment required under section 256L.03,
subdivision 4, is greater than the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit under section
256L.03, subdivision 3, payment must be the lesser of:
      (1) the amount remaining in the enrollee's benefit limit; or
    (2) charges submitted for the inpatient hospital services less any co-payment established under
section 256L.03, subdivision 4.
    The hospital may seek payment from the enrollee for the amount by which usual and customary
charges exceed the payment under this paragraph. If payment is reduced under section 256L.03,
subdivision 3, paragraph (b), the hospital may not seek payment from the enrollee for the amount
of the reduction.

percent of managed care plan payments and county-based purchasing plan payments under this
section pending completion of performance targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable,
objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except in the case of a performance target based
on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be
outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate,
to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance
target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the administrative measures used as
performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative
services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending
on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific
performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics
of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and
no later than July 31 of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are
achieved. A   ­­­

    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall withhold an
additional three percent of managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan payments under
this section. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31
of the following calendar year. The return of the withhold under this paragraph is not subject to the
requirements of paragraph (b).
    (d) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall include as
part of the performance targets described in paragraph (b) a reduction in the plan's emergency room
utilization rate for state health care program enrollees by a measurable rate of five percent from the
plan's utilization rate for the previous calendar year.
    The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31 of the
following calendar year if the managed care plan or county-based purchasing plan demonstrates to
the satisfaction of the commissioner that a reduction in the utilization rate was achieved.
    The withhold described in this paragraph shall continue for each consecutive contract period
until the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees is reduced
by 25 percent of the plan's emergency room utilization rate for state health care program enrollees
for calendar year 2009. Hospitals shall cooperate with the health plans in meeting this performance
target and shall accept payment withholds that may be returned to the hospitals if the performance
target is achieved. The commissioner shall structure the withhold so that the commissioner returns a
portion of the withheld funds in amounts commensurate with achieved reductions in utilization less
than the targeted amount. The withhold described in this paragraph does not apply to county-based
purchasing plans.
    (e) A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include
as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this section that is reasonably
expected to be returned.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 252.27, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Contribution amount. (a) The natural or adoptive parents of a minor child, including
a child determined eligible for medical assistance without consideration of parental income, must
contribute to the cost of services used by making monthly payments on a sliding scale based on
income, unless the child is married or has been married, parental rights have been terminated, or
the child's adoption is subsidized according to section 259.67 or through title IV-E of the Social
Security Act. The parental contribution is a partial or full payment for medical services provided
for diagnostic, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitation, maintenance, and personal
care services as defined in United States Code, title 26, section 213, needed by the child with a
chronic illness or disability.
    (b) For households with adjusted gross income equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal
poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following schedule
of rates to the adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
11518                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [103RD DAY

contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
    (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 975 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to ten percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 975
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
   (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 975 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 12.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
    If the child lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior
to calculating the parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section
256B.35, the parent is responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section
in addition to the parental contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is
reduced by any amount required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only
if actually paid.
    (c) The household size to be used in determining the amount of contribution under paragraph (b)
includes natural and adoptive parents and their dependents, including the child receiving services.
Adjustments in the contribution amount due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines
shall be implemented on the first day of July following publication of the changes.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b), "income" means the adjusted gross income of the natural
or adoptive parents determined according to the previous year's federal tax form, except, effective
retroactive to July 1, 2003, taxable capital gains to the extent the funds have been used to purchase
a home shall not be counted as income.
    (e) The contribution shall be explained in writing to the parents at the time eligibility for services
is being determined. The contribution shall be made on a monthly basis effective with the first month
in which the child receives services. Annually upon redetermination or at termination of eligibility, if
the contribution exceeded the cost of services provided, the local agency or the state shall reimburse
that excess amount to the parents, either by direct reimbursement if the parent is no longer required
to pay a contribution, or by a reduction in or waiver of parental fees until the excess amount is
exhausted. All reimbursements must include a notice that the amount reimbursed may be taxable
income if the parent paid for the parent's fees through an employer's health care flexible spending
account under the Internal Revenue Code, section 125, and that the parent is responsible for paying
the taxes owed on the amount reimbursed.
    (f) The monthly contribution amount must be reviewed at least every 12 months; when there
is a change in household size; and when there is a loss of or gain in income from one month to
another in excess of ten percent. The local agency shall mail a written notice 30 days in advance of
103RD DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 12, 2010                                        11519

the effective date of a change in the contribution amount. A decrease in the contribution amount is
effective in the month that the parent verifies a reduction in income or change in household size.
    (g) Parents of a minor child who do not live with each other shall each pay the contribution
required under paragraph (a). An amount equal to the annual court-ordered child support payment
actually paid on behalf of the child receiving services shall be deducted from the adjusted gross
income of the parent making the payment prior to calculating the parental contribution under
paragraph (b).
    (h) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be increased by an additional five percent if
the local agency determines that insurance coverage is available but not obtained for the child.
For purposes of this section, "available" means the insurance is a benefit of employment for a
family member at an annual cost of no more than five percent of the family's annual income. For
purposes of this section, "insurance" means health and accident insurance coverage, enrollment
in a nonprofit health service plan, health maintenance organization, self-insured plan, or preferred
provider organization.
    Parents who have more than one child receiving services shall not be required to pay more than
the amount for the child with the highest expenditures. There shall be no resource contribution from
the parents. The parent shall not be required to pay a contribution in excess of the cost of the services
provided to the child, not counting payments made to school districts for education-related services.
Notice of an increase in fee payment must be given at least 30 days before the increased fee is due.
  (i) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be reduced by $300 per fiscal year if, in the 12
months prior to July 1:
   (1) the parent applied for insurance for the child;
   (2) the insurer denied insurance;
    (3) the parents submitted a complaint or appeal, in writing to the insurer, submitted a complaint
or appeal, in writing, to the commissioner of health or the commissioner of commerce, or litigated
the complaint or appeal; and
   (4) as a result of the dispute, the insurer reversed its decision and granted insurance.
   For purposes of this section, "insurance" has the meaning given in paragraph (h).
    A parent who has requested a reduction in the contribution amount under this paragraph shall
submit proof in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner or county agency, including,
but not limited to, the insurer's denial of insurance, the written letter or complaint of the parents,
court documents, and the written response of the insurer approving insurance. The determinations
of the commissioner or county agency under this paragraph are not rules subject to chapter 14.
   (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), for the period from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2013, the parental
contribution shall be computed by applying the following contribution schedule to the adjusted gross
income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
11520                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [103RD DAY

   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to eight percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 525 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 9.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
    (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 900 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 9.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to 12 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 900
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
    (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 900 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 13.5 percent of adjusted gross income. If the child
lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior to calculating the
parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section 256B.35, the parent is
responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section in addition to the parental
contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is reduced by any amount
required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only if actually paid.

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.9657, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. ICF/MR license surcharge. (a) Effective July 1, 2003, each non-state-operated
facility as defined under section 256B.501, subdivision 1, shall pay to the commissioner an annual

the federal poverty guidelines. Annual adjustments in the premium schedule based upon changes in
the federal poverty guidelines shall be effective for premiums due in July of each year.

six-month income review or when a change in income or household size is reported. Enrollees
must report any change in income or household size within ten days of when the change occurs. A
decreased premium resulting from a reported change in income or household size shall be effective
the first day of the next available billing month after the change is reported. Except for changes
occurring from annual cost-of-living increases, a change resulting in an increased premium shall
not affect the premium amount until the next six-month review.
   (h) Premium payment is due upon notification from the commissioner of the premium amount
required. Premiums may be paid in installments at the discretion of the commissioner.
    (i) Nonpayment of the premium shall result in denial or termination of medical assistance
unless the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment. Good cause exists if the requirements
specified in Minnesota Rules, part 9506.0040, subpart 7, items B to D, are met. Except when an
installment agreement is accepted by the commissioner, all persons disenrolled for nonpayment
of a premium must pay any past due premiums as well as current premiums due prior to being
reenrolled. Nonpayment shall include payment with a returned, refused, or dishonored instrument.
The commissioner may require a guaranteed form of payment as the only means to replace a

Senior LinkAge Line for long-term care options counseling and transitional consultation. The
Senior LinkAge Line shall provide a certificate to the prospective resident and also send a copy
of the certificate to the housing with services establishment that the prospective resident chooses,
verifying that consultation has been provided to the prospective resident or the prospective
resident's legal representative. The housing with services establishment shall not execute a contract
or allow a prospective resident to move in until the establishment has received certification from
the Senior LinkAge Line. Prospective residents refusing to contact the Senior LinkAge Line are
required to sign a waiver form supplied by the provider. The housing with services establishment
shall maintain copies of contracts, waiver forms, and certificates for audit for a period of three
years. The purpose of transitional long-term care consultation is to support persons with current
or anticipated long-term care needs in making informed choices among options that include the
most cost-effective and least restrictive settings, and to delay spenddown to eligibility for publicly
funded programs by connecting people to alternative services in their homes before transition to
housing with services. Regardless of the consultation, prospective residents maintain the right to
choose housing with services or assisted living if that option is their preference.
    (b) Transitional consultation services are provided as determined by the commissioner of

consultation must be provided within five working days of the request of the prospective resident
as follows:
   (1) the consultation must be provided by a qualified professional as determined by the
commissioner;
    (2) the consultation must include a review of the prospective resident's reasons for considering

    (i) the move is based on a recent precipitating event that precludes the person from living safely
in the community or institution, such as sustaining injury, unanticipated discharge from hospital
or nursing facility, inability of caregivers to provide needed care, lack of access to needed care or
services, or declining health status; and
    (ii) the Senior LinkAge Line is contacted within ten working days following the move to the
registered housing with services, or as soon as is reasonable considering the prospective resident's
condition; and
   (5) the Senior LinkAge Line may provide the long-term care options counseling and transitional

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0915, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 3i. Rate reduction for customized living and 24-hour customized living services. (a)
Effective July 1, 2010, the commissioner shall reduce service component rates and service rate limits
for customized living services and 24-hour customized living services, from the rates in effect on
June 30, 2010, by five percent.
   (b) To implement the rate reductions in this subdivision, capitation rates paid by the
commissioner to managed care organizations under section 256B.69 shall reflect a ten percent
reduction for the specified services for the period January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2011, and a five
percent reduction for those services on and after July 1, 2011.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.441, subdivision 55, is amended to
read:
      Subd. 55. Phase-in of rebased operating payment rates. (a) For the rate years beginning
October 1, 2008, to October 1, 2015, the operating payment rate calculated under this section
shall be phased in by blending the operating rate with the operating payment rate determined
under section 256B.434. For purposes of this subdivision, the rate to be used that is determined
under section 256B.434 shall not include the portion of the operating payment rate related to
performance-based incentive payments under section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph (d). For
the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the operating payment rate for each facility shall be 13
percent of the operating payment rate from this section, and 87 percent of the operating payment
rate from section 256B.434. F            ­o ­­r­­h

   (b) For the rate year beginning October 1, 2008, the commissioner shall apply limits to the
operating payment rate increases under paragraph (a) by creating a minimum percentage increase
and a maximum percentage increase.
    (1) Each nursing facility that receives a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase
under paragraph (a) of less than one percent, when compared to its operating payment rate on
September 30, 2008, computed using rates with RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive a rate adjustment
of one percent.
    (2) The commissioner shall determine a maximum percentage increase that will result in savings
equal to the cost of allowing the minimum increase in clause (1). Nursing facilities with a blended
October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under paragraph (a) greater than the maximum
percentage increase determined by the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment
rate on September 30, 2008, computed using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the
maximum percentage increase.
    (3) Nursing facilities with a blended October 1, 2008, operating payment rate increase under
paragraph (a) greater than one percent and less than the maximum percentage increase determined by
the commissioner, when compared to its operating payment rate on September 30, 2008, computed
using rates with a RUG's weight of 1.00, shall receive the blended October 1, 2008, operating
payment rate increase determined under paragraph (a).
    (4) The October 1, 2009, through October 1, 2015, operating payment rate for facilities receiving
the maximum percentage increase determined in clause (2) shall be the amount determined under
paragraph (a) less the difference between the amount determined under paragraph (a) for October 1,
2008, and the amount allowed under clause (2). This rate restriction does not apply to rate increases
provided in any other section.
   (c) A portion of the funds received under this subdivision that are in excess of operating
payment rates that a facility would have received under section 256B.434, as determined in
accordance with clauses (1) to (3), shall be subject to the requirements in section 256B.434,
subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h).
    (1) Determine the amount of additional funding available to a facility, which shall be equal
to total medical assistance resident days from the most recent reporting year times the difference
between the blended rate determined in paragraph (a) for the rate year being computed and the
blended rate for the prior year.
   (2) Determine the portion of all operating costs, for the most recent reporting year, that are
compensation related. If this value exceeds 75 percent, use 75 percent.
   (3) Subtract the amount determined in clause (2) from 75 percent.
    (4) The portion of the fund received under this subdivision that shall be subject to the
requirements in section 256B.434, subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h), shall equal the amount
determined in clause (1) times the amount determined in clause (3).

2010, the commissioner shall increase the total operating payment rate for each facility reimbursed
under this section by $8.74 per day. The increase shall not be subject to any annual percentage
increase.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 1, 2010.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services

as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires four years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
      (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. T       ­h­­e­­p­­ro

A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until July 1, 2009,
expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited to
the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have

        Sec. 84. HOUSING OPTIONS.
    The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the commissioner of administration
and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, and representatives of counties, residents' advocacy
groups, consumers of housing services, and provider agencies shall explore ways to maximize the
availability and affordability of housing choices available to persons with disabilities or who need
care assistance due to other health challenges. A goal shall also be to minimize state physical plant
costs in order to serve more persons with appropriate program and care support. Consideration shall
be given to:
    (1) improved access to rent subsidies;
    (2) use of cooperatives, land trusts, and other limited equity ownership models;
    (3) whether a public equity housing fund should be established that would maintain the state's
interest, to the extent paid from state funds, including group residential housing and Minnesota
supplemental aid shelter-needy funds in provider-owned housing, so that when sold, the state would
recover its share for a public equity fund to be used for future public needs under this chapter;
  (4) the desirability of the state acquiring an ownership interest or promoting the use of publicly
owned housing;

recommendations and language for proposed legislation to:
    (1) define the administrative and the service functions of case management for persons with
disabilities and make changes to improve the funding for administrative functions;
    (2) standardize and simplify processes, standards, and timelines for case management within the
Department of Human Services, Disability Services Division, including eligibility determinations,
resource allocation, management of dollars, provision for assignment of one case manager at a
time per person, waiting lists, quality assurance, host county concurrence requirements, county of
financial responsibility provisions, and waiver compliance; and
   (3) increase opportunities for consumer choice of case management functions involving service
coordination.
   (b) In developing these recommendations, the commissioner shall consider the
recommendations of the 2007 Redesigning Case Management Services for Persons with
Disabilities report and consult with existing stakeholder groups, which include representatives of
counties, disability and senior advocacy groups, service providers, and representatives of agencies
which provide contracted case management.

activities under any future grants to the organization.
   (b) The commissioner shall report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256J.24, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Family cap. (a) MFIP assistance units shall not receive an increase in the cash portion
of the transitional standard as a result of the birth of a child, unless one of the conditions under
paragraph (b) is met. The child shall be considered a member of the assistance unit according to
subdivisions 1 to 3, but shall be excluded in determining family size for purposes of determining
the amount of the cash portion of the transitional standard under subdivision 5. The child shall be
included in determining family size for purposes of determining the food portion of the transitional
standard. The transitional standard under this subdivision shall be the total of the cash and food
portions as specified in this paragraph. The family wage level under this subdivision shall be based
on the family size used to determine the food portion of the transitional standard.
    (b) A child shall be included in determining family size for purposes of determining the amount

assistance on or after July 1, 2003, the child is born to the adult parent within ten months of the date
the family is eligible for assistance;
   (3) the child was conceived as a result of a sexual assault or incest, provided that the incident
has been reported to a law enforcement agency;
    (4) the child's mother is a minor caregiver as defined in section 256J.08, subdivision 59, and the
child, or multiple children, are the mother's first birth; ­

    (6) any child previously excluded in determining family size under paragraph (a) shall be
included if the adult parent or parents have not received benefits from the diversionary work
program under section 256J.95 or MFIP assistance in the previous ten months. An adult parent

qualified professional, as developmentally disabled or mentally ill, and the condition severely
limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable employment;
   (2) a person who:

   (i) has been assessed by a vocational specialist or the county agency to be unemployable for
purposes of this subdivision; or
    (ii) has an IQ below 80 who has been assessed by a vocational specialist or a county agency to
be employable, but the condition severely limits the person's ability to obtain or maintain suitable
employment. The determination of IQ level must be made by a qualified professional. In the case
of a non-English-speaking person: (A) the determination must be made by a qualified professional
with experience conducting culturally appropriate assessments, whenever possible; (B) the county
may accept reports that identify an IQ range as opposed to a specific score; (C) these reports must
include a statement of confidence in the results;

made or confirmed within the previous 12 months. In the case of a non-English-speaking person: (i)
the determination must be made by a qualified professional with experience conducting culturally
appropriate assessments, whenever possible; and (ii) these reports must include a statement of
confidence in the results. If a rehabilitation plan for a participant extended as learning disabled is
developed or approved by the county agency, the plan must be incorporated into the employment

exception of section 256B.0654, subdivision 4, shall be covered under a health plan for persons who
are concurrently covered by both the health plan and enrolled in medical assistance under chapter
256B.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a period of private duty nursing services may be subject to the
co-payment, coinsurance, deductible, or other enrollee cost-sharing requirements that apply under
the health plan. Cost-sharing requirements for private duty nursing services must not place a greater
financial burden on the insured or enrollee than those requirements applied by the health plan to other
similar services or benefits. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a health plan company from
requiring prior authorization by the health plan company for such services as required by section
256B.0625, subdivision 7, or use of contracted providers under the applicable provisions of the
health plan.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, and applies to health plans offered,
sold, issued, or renewed on or after that date.

    Subd. 8. Payments to improve services to American Indians. The commissioner may set rates
for chemical dependency services to American Indians according to the American Indian Health
Improvement Act, Public Law 94-437, for eligible vendors. These rates shall supersede rates set
in county purchase of service agreements when payments are made on behalf of clients eligible
according to Public Law 94-437.
      Sec. 15. [254B.13] PILOT PROJECTS; CHEMICAL HEALTH CARE.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization for pilot projects. The commissioner may approve and
implement pilot projects developed under the planning process required under Laws 2009, chapter
79, article 7, section 26, to provide alternatives to and enhance coordination of the delivery of
chemical health services required under section 254B.03.
    Subd. 2. Program design and implementation. (a) The commissioner and counties
participating in the pilot projects shall continue to work in partnership to refine and implement the
pilot projects initiated under Laws 2009, chapter 79, article 7, section 26.
    (b) The commissioner and counties participating in the pilot projects shall complete the
planning phase by June 30, 2010, and, if approved by the commissioner for implementation, enter
into agreements governing the operation of the pilot projects with implementation scheduled no
earlier than July 1, 2010.
    Subd. 3. Program evaluation. The commissioner shall evaluate pilot projects under this section
and report the results of the evaluation to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over chemical health issues by January 15, 2013. Evaluation of the
pilot projects must be based on outcome evaluation criteria negotiated with the pilot projects prior
to implementation.
    Subd. 4. Notice of project discontinuation. Each county's participation in the pilot project may
be discontinued for any reason by the county or the commissioner of human services after 30 days'
written notice to the other party. Any unspent funds held for the exiting county's pro rata share in the
special revenue fund under the authority in subdivision 5, paragraph (d), shall be transferred to the
consolidated chemical dependency treatment fund following discontinuation of the pilot project.

   Subd. 5. Duties of commissioner. (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions in this chapter, the
commissioner may authorize pilot projects to use chemical dependency treatment funds to pay for
nontreatment pilot services:
   (1) in addition to those authorized under section 254B.03, subdivision 2, paragraph (a); and
   (2) by vendors in addition to those authorized under section 254B.05 when not providing
chemical dependency treatment services.
   (b) For purposes of this section, "nontreatment pilot services" include navigator services, peer
support, family engagement and support, housing support, rent subsidies, supported employment,
and independent living skills.
    (c) State expenditures for chemical dependency services and nontreatment pilot services
provided by or through the pilot projects must not be greater than the chemical dependency
treatment fund expected share of forecasted expenditures in the absence of the pilot projects.
The commissioner may restructure the schedule of payments between the state and participating
counties under the local agency share and division of cost provisions under section 254B.03,
subdivisions 3 and 4, as necessary to facilitate the operation of the pilot projects.
    (d) To the extent that state fiscal year expenditures within a pilot project are less than the expected
share of forecasted expenditures in the absence of the pilot projects, the commissioner shall deposit
the unexpended funds in a separate account within the consolidated chemical dependency treatment
fund, and make these funds available for expenditure by the pilot projects the following year. To the
extent that treatment and nontreatment pilot services expenditures within the pilot project exceed
the amount expected in the absence of the pilot projects, the pilot project county or counties are
responsible for the portion of nontreatment pilot services expenditures in excess of the otherwise
expected share of forecasted expenditures.
    (e) The commissioner may waive administrative rule requirements that are incompatible with the
implementation of the pilot project, except that any chemical dependency treatment funded under
this section must continue to be provided by a licensed treatment provider.
   (f) The commissioner shall not approve or enter into any agreement related to pilot projects
authorized under this section that puts current or future federal funding at risk.
   Subd. 6. Duties of county board. The county board, or other county entity that is approved to
administer a pilot project, shall:
   (1) administer the pilot project in a manner consistent with the objectives described in
subdivision 2 and the planning process in subdivision 5;
   (2) ensure that no one is denied chemical dependency treatment services for which they would
otherwise be eligible under section 254A.03, subdivision 3; and
   (3) provide the commissioner with timely and pertinent information as negotiated in agreements
governing operation of the pilot projects.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to

upon oath the parties applying for a license relative to the legality of the contemplated marriage.
If one party is unable to appear in person, the party appearing may complete the absent applicant's
information. The local registrar shall provide a copy of the marriage application to the party who is
unable to appear, who must verify the accuracy of the party's information in a notarized statement.
The marriage license must not be released until the verification statement has been received by
the local registrar. If at the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal
impediment to it, including the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue
the license, containing the full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state
of residence, with the county seal attached, and make a record of the date of issuance. The license
shall be valid for a period of six months. Except as provided in paragraph (c), the local registrar
shall collect from the applicant a fee of ­  $1

and filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics
the reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period
of six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of the
county in which the application is made may authorize the license to be issued at any time before
expiration of the five-day period required under paragraph (a). A waiver of the five-day waiting
period must be in the following form:

    STATE OF MINNESOTA, COUNTY OF .................... (insert county name)
    After reviewing the above application, I am satisfied that an emergency or extraordinary
circumstance exists that justifies the issuance of the marriage license before the expiration of
five days from the date of the application. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the local registrar is
authorized and directed to issue the license forthwith.
    .....................................................
    ................................ (judge of district court)

education is $40. In order to qualify for the reduced license fee, the parties must submit at the time
of applying for the marriage license a signed, dated, and notarized statement from the person who
provided the premarital education on their letterhead confirming that it was received. The premarital
education must be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's designee, a person
authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized to practice marriage
and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use of a premarital
inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)

and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or

    Subd. 4. Distribution of funds. (a) Following the distribution described under paragraph (b),
the commissioner shall annually distribute the available medical education funds to all qualifying
applicants based on a distribution formula that reflects a summation of two factors:
    (1) a public program volume factor, which is determined by the total volume of public program
revenue received by each training site as a percentage of all public program revenue received by all
training sites in the fund pool; and
    (2) a supplemental public program volume factor, which is determined by providing a
supplemental payment of 20 percent of each training site's grant to training sites whose public
program revenue accounted for at least 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received
by all eligible training sites. Grants to training sites whose public program revenue accounted for
less than 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received by all eligible training sites
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total value of the supplemental payment.
    Public program revenue for the distribution formula includes revenue from medical assistance,
prepaid medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and prepaid general assistance medical
care. Training sites that receive no public program revenue are ineligible for funds available under

training costs per trainee in clinical medical education programs for dental students. Total statewide
average costs per trainee for pharmacy residents is based on audited clinical training costs per

or state sources.

distributed to each of the sponsor's clinical medical education programs based on the criteria in

For the purposes of clauses (1) to (3),
the commissioner may supplement the
MOE claim with working family credit
