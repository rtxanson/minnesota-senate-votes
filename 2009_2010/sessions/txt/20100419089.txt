    Subd. 7. Considerations in designating sites and routes. (a) The commission's site and
route permit determinations must be guided by the state's goals to conserve resources, minimize
environmental impacts, minimize human settlement and other land use conflicts, and ensure
the state's electric energy security through efficient, cost-effective power supply and electric
transmission infrastructure.
   (b) To facilitate the study, research, evaluation, and designation of sites and routes, the

commission shall be guided by, but not limited to, the following considerations:
    (1) evaluation of research and investigations relating to the effects on land, water and air
resources of large electric power generating plants and high-voltage transmission lines and the
effects of water and air discharges and electric and magnetic fields resulting from such facilities on
public health and welfare, vegetation, animals, materials and aesthetic values, including baseline
studies, predictive modeling, and evaluation of new or improved methods for minimizing adverse
impacts of water and air discharges and other matters pertaining to the effects of power plants on
the water and air environment;
   (2) environmental evaluation of sites and routes proposed for future development and expansion
and their relationship to the land, water, air and human resources of the state;
    (3) evaluation of the effects of new electric power generation and transmission technologies and
systems related to power plants designed to minimize adverse environmental effects;
   (4) evaluation of the potential for beneficial uses of waste energy from proposed large electric
power generating plants;
    (5) analysis of the direct and indirect economic impact of proposed sites and routes including,
but not limited to, productive agricultural land lost or impaired;
    (6) evaluation of adverse direct and indirect environmental effects that cannot be avoided should
the proposed site and route be accepted;
   (7) evaluation of alternatives to the applicant's proposed site or route proposed pursuant to
subdivisions 1 and 2;
    (8) evaluation of potential routes that would use or parallel existing railroad and highway
rights-of-way;
    (9) evaluation of governmental survey lines and other natural division lines of agricultural land
so as to minimize interference with agricultural operations;
   (10) evaluation of the future needs for additional high-voltage transmission lines in the same
general area as any proposed route, and the advisability of ordering the construction of structures
capable of expansion in transmission capacity through multiple circuiting or design modifications;
    (11) evaluation of irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources should the proposed
site or route be approved; and
    (12) when appropriate, consideration of problems raised by other state and federal agencies and
local entities.
    (c) If the commission's rules are substantially similar to existing regulations of a federal agency
to which the utility in the state is subject, the federal regulations must be applied by the commission.
   (d) No site or route shall be designated which violates state agency rules.
    (e) The commission must make specific findings that it has considered locating a route for a
high-voltage transmission line on an existing high-voltage transmission route and the use of parallel
existing highway right-of-way and, to the extent those are not used for the route, the commission

of the interest in real property is filed. The
notice of funding agreement must contain:

purposes of the grant agreement controlling
the acquisition of the property. The interest
in real property, or any portion of the
interest in real property, shall not be sold,
transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed of
or further encumbered without obtaining the
prior written approval of the Lessard-Sams
Outdoor Heritage Council or its successor.
The ownership of the interest in real property
shall transfer to the state if: (1) the holder of
the interest in real property fails to comply
with the terms and conditions of the grant
agreement or accomplishment plan; or (2)
restrictions are placed on the land that
preclude its use for the intended purpose as
specified in the appropriation."

the council. The responsibility for reporting
under this section may be transferred by
the recipient of the appropriation to another
person or entity that holds the interest in the
real property. To complete the transfer of
reporting responsibility, the recipient of the
appropriation must: (1) inform the person to
whom the responsibility is transferred of that
person's reporting responsibility; (2) inform
the person to whom the responsibility is
transferred of the property restrictions under
subdivision 13; (3) provide written notice
to the council of the transfer of reporting
responsibility, including contact information
for the person to whom the responsibility is
transferred; and (4) provide the Lessard-Sams
Outdoor Heritage Council or its successor
written documentation from the person or
entity holding the interest in real property
certifying its acceptance of all reporting
obligations and responsibilities previously
held by the recipient of the appropriation.
After the transfer, the person or entity that
holds the interest in the real property is
responsible for reporting requirements under
this section."

     (a) Notwithstanding the public sale provisions of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 282, or other law
to the contrary, Pine County may sell by private sale the tax-forfeited land described in paragraph
(c).
  (b) The conveyance must be in a form approved by the attorney general. The attorney general
may make changes to the land description to correct errors and ensure accuracy.
    (c) The land to be sold is located in Pine County and is described as: the East 132 feet of the
Northeast Quarter of the Southeast Quarter of Section 11, Township 42 North, Range 17 West,
Wilma Township, Pine County, Minnesota, subject to a public road easement over, under, and across
the West 66 feet thereof, and the East 132 feet of the Southeast Quarter of the Northeast Quarter of
Section 11, Township 42 North, Range 17 West, Wilma Township, Pine County, Minnesota, subject
to a public road easement over, under, and across the West 66 feet thereof.

served if the lands were returned to private ownership. The county will be able to access adjacent
tax-forfeited property by the public road easement."

   Senator Scheid moved to amend S.F. No. 2510 as follows:

89TH DAY]                                              MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010                                                                       9675

      "Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.106, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Accessibility. (a) Public buildings. The code must provide for making public buildings
constructed or remodeled after July 1, 1963, accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities,
although this does not require the remodeling of public buildings solely to provide accessibility and
usability to persons with disabilities when remodeling would not otherwise be undertaken.
    (b) Leased space. No agency of the state may lease space for agency operations in a
non-state-owned building unless the building satisfies the requirements of the State Building
Code for accessibility by persons with disabilities, or is eligible to display the state symbol of
accessibility. This limitation applies to leases of 30 days or more for space of at least 1,000 square
feet.
    (c) Meetings or conferences. Meetings or conferences for the public or for state employees
which are sponsored in whole or in part by a state agency must be held in buildings that meet
the State Building Code requirements relating to accessibility for persons with disabilities. This
subdivision does not apply to any classes, seminars, or training programs offered by the Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities or the University of Minnesota. Meetings or conferences intended
for specific individuals none of whom need the accessibility features for persons with disabilities
specified in the State Building Code need not comply with this subdivision unless a person with a
disability gives reasonable advance notice of an intent to attend the meeting or conference. When
sign language interpreters will be provided, meetings or conference sites must be chosen which
allow hearing impaired participants to see their signing clearly.
    (d) Exemptions. The commissioner may grant an exemption from the requirements of
paragraphs (b) and (c) in advance if an agency has demonstrated that reasonable efforts were made
to secure facilities which complied with those requirements and if the selected facilities are the
best available for access for persons with disabilities. Exemptions shall be granted using criteria
developed by the commissioner in consultation with the Council on Disability.
    (e) Symbol indicating access. The wheelchair symbol adopted by Rehabilitation International's
Eleventh World Congress is the state symbol indicating buildings, facilities, and grounds which are
accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. In the interests of uniformity, this symbol is
the sole symbol for display in or on all public or private buildings, facilities, and grounds which
qualify for its use. The secretary of state shall obtain the symbol and keep it on file. No building,
facility, or grounds may display the symbol unless it is in compliance with the rules adopted by the
commissioner under subdivision 1. Before any rules are proposed for adoption under this paragraph,
the commissioner shall consult with the Council on Disability. Rules adopted under this paragraph
must be enforced in the same way as other accessibility rules of the State Building Code.

municipality is not properly administering and enforcing the State Building Code's requirements
for persons with disabilities, the commissioner may have the administration and enforcement

official certified by the state. The commissioner shall notify the affected municipality in writing
immediately upon making the determination, and the municipality may challenge the determination
as a contested case before the commissioner pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act. The

objective criteria and identifying characteristics for use in determining whether individuals are
or may be members of gangs involved in criminal activity. The council shall review and update
the criteria and characteristics adopted under this clause every two years with the objective of
ensuring effectiveness and relevance to the accurate identification of subjects actively involved in
criminal gang activity. As part of its review process, the council shall obtain input from members
of communities that are impacted by criminal gang activity. Before adopting any changes under
this clause, the council must submit its recommendations to the commissioner of public safety for
approval.
    Subd. 3a. Duties and authority of commissioner. (a) By September 1, 2010, the commissioner
of public safety shall establish guidelines for the certification of multijurisdictional entities that are
established under this section. The guidelines shall require that all multijurisdictional entities:
      (1) be subject to the operational command and supervision of one of the participating agencies;
and
   (2) have adequate staffing and funding to support law enforcement, prosecutorial, and financial
operations, including bookkeeping, evidence handling, and inventory recording.
   (b) A multijurisdictional entity may not operate unless it meets the guidelines established by,
and is annually certified by, the commissioner of public safety. If, at any time, the commissioner
revokes an entity's certification, the commissioner may order any or all of the following:
      (1) dissolution of the entity, its governing boards, or both;
    (2) transfer of responsibilities of the entity, its governing boards, or both, to the commissioner
of public safety; and
      (3) any other actions deemed necessary by the commissioner.
    Notwithstanding any action taken by the commissioner, any outstanding obligations or liabilities
of the entity remain with the entity and the parties to the agreement and do not transfer.
    (c) Except as provided in section 8, a multijurisdictional entity that is operating on the effective
date of this section has six months from the date guidelines are established under paragraph (a) to
be certified under this section.

a nonprofit organization may request the Board of Innovation to grant a waiver from one or more
administrative rules or a temporary, limited exemption from enforcement of state procedural laws
governing delivery of services by the local government unit or nonprofit organization. Two or more
local government units may submit a joint application for a waiver or exemption under this section
if they propose to cooperate in providing a service or program that is subject to the rule or law.
Before a local unit of government may submit an application to the board, the governing body of
the local government unit must approve, in concept, the proposed waiver or exemption at a meeting
required to be public under chapter 13D. A waiver or exemption granted to a nonprofit organization
under this section applies to services provided to all of the organization's clients.
    (b) A school district that is granted a variance from rules of the commissioner of education
under section 122A.163 need not apply to the board for a waiver of those rules under this section. A
school district may not seek a waiver of rules under this section if the commissioner of education has
authority to grant a variance to the rules under section 122A.163. This paragraph does not preclude a
school district from being included in a cooperative effort with another local government unit under
this section.

waiver of a rule or exemption from enforcement of a law under this section shall present a written
application to the board. The application must include:

respect to which the waiver or exemption is sought; and
    (3) a description of the improved service outcome sought, including an explanation of the effect
of the waiver or exemption in accomplishing that outcome.
    (b) A local government unit submitting an application must provide a copy to the exclusive
representative certified under section 179A.12 to represent employees who provide the service or
89TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010                                        9709

program affected by the requested waiver or exemption.
    Subd. 3. Review process. (a) Upon receipt of an application, the board shall commence review
of the application, as provided in this subdivision. The board shall dismiss an application if it finds
that the application proposes a waiver of rules or exemption from enforcement of laws that would
result in due process violations, violations of federal law or the state or federal constitution, or the
loss of services to people who are entitled to them.
    (b) The board shall determine whether a law from which an exemption for enforcement is sought
is a procedural law, specifying how a local government unit or nonprofit organization is to achieve
an outcome, rather than a substantive law prescribing the outcome or otherwise establishing policy.
In making its determination, the board shall consider whether the law specifies such requirements
as:
   (1) who must deliver a service;
   (2) where the service must be delivered;
   (3) to whom and in what form reports regarding the service must be made; and
   (4) how long or how often the service must be made available to a given recipient.
    (c) If a member of the board also is a commissioner, a commissioner's designee, or the state
auditor, or is employed by an agency with jurisdiction over a rule or law affected by an application,
the member must not participate in the decision on the particular waiver or exemption.
    (d) If the application is submitted by a local government unit or a nonprofit organization in the
metropolitan area or the unit or nonprofit organization requests a waiver of a rule or temporary,
limited exemptions from enforcement of a procedural law over which the Metropolitan Council or
a metropolitan agency has jurisdiction, the board shall also transmit a copy of the application to the
council for review and comment. The council shall report its comments to the board within 60 days
of the date the application was transmitted to the council. The council may point out any resources
or technical assistance it may be able to provide a local government unit or nonprofit organization
submitting a request under this section.
    (e) Within 15 days after receipt of the application, the board shall transmit a copy of it to
the commissioner of each agency having jurisdiction over a rule or law from which a waiver or
exemption is sought. The agency may mail a notice that it has received an application for a waiver
or exemption to all persons who have registered with the agency under section 14.14, subdivision
1a, identifying the rule or law from which a waiver or exemption is requested. If no agency has
jurisdiction over the rule or law, the board shall transmit a copy of the application to the attorney
general. The agency shall inform the board of its agreement with or objection to and grounds for
objection to the waiver or exemption request within 60 days of the date when the application was
transmitted to it. An agency's failure to respond under this paragraph is considered agreement to
the waiver or exemption. The board shall decide whether to grant a waiver or exemption at its next
regularly scheduled meeting following its receipt of an agency's response or the end of the 60-day
response period. If consideration of an application is not concluded at that meeting, the matter may
be carried over to the next meeting of the board. Interested persons may submit written comments
to the board on the waiver or exemption request up to the time of its vote on the application.
   (f) If the exclusive representative of the affected employees of the requesting local government
9710                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [89TH DAY

unit objects to the waiver or exemption request, it may inform the board of the objection to and the
grounds for the objection to the waiver or exemption request within 60 days of the receipt of the
application.
    Subd. 4. Hearing. If the agency or the exclusive representative does not agree with the waiver
or exemption request, the board shall set a date for a hearing on the application. The hearing must
be conducted informally at a meeting of the board. Persons representing the local government unit
shall present their request for the waiver or exemption, and a representative from the agency shall
explain the agency's objection to the waiver or exemption. Members of the board may request
additional information from either party. The board may also request, either before or at the hearing,
information or comments from representatives of business, labor, local governments, state agencies,
consultants, and members of the public. If necessary, the hearing may be continued at a subsequent
board meeting. A waiver or exemption requires a majority vote of the board members. The board
may modify the terms of the waiver or exemption request in arriving at the agreement required under
subdivision 5.
    Subd. 5. Conditions of agreements. (a) If the board grants a request for a waiver or exemption,
the board and the entity making the request shall enter into an agreement providing for the delivery
of the service or program that is the subject of the application. The agreement must specify desired
outcomes and the means of measurement by which the board will determine whether the outcomes
specified in the agreement have been met. The agreement must specify the duration of the waiver
or exemption. The duration of a waiver from an administrative rule may be for no less than two
years and no more than four years, subject to renewal if both parties agree. An exemption from
enforcement of a law terminates ten days after adjournment of the regular legislative session held
during the calendar year following the year when the exemption is granted, unless the legislature
has acted to extend or make permanent the exemption.
    (b) If the board grants a waiver or exemption, it must report the waiver or exemption to the
legislature, including the chairs of the governmental operations and appropriate policy committees
in the house of representatives and senate, and the governor within 30 days.
    (c) The board may reconsider or renegotiate the agreement if the rule or law affected by the
waiver or exemption is amended or repealed during the term of the original agreement. A waiver
of a rule under this section has the effect of a variance granted by an agency under section 14.055,
subdivision 4. The recipient of an exemption from enforcement of a procedural requirement in state
law under this section is exempt from that law for the duration of the exemption. The board may
require periodic reports from the recipient, or conduct investigations of the service or program.
    Subd. 6. Enforcement. If the board finds that the recipient of a waiver or an exemption has failed
to comply with the terms of the agreement under subdivision 5, it may rescind the agreement. After
an agreement is rescinded, the recipient is subject to the rules and laws covered by the agreement.
    Subd. 7. Access to data. If the recipient of a waiver or an exemption through a cooperative
program under this section gains access to data that is classified as not public, the access to and use
of the data for the recipient is governed by the same restrictions on access to and use of the data that
apply to the unit that collected, created, received, or maintained the data.
   Sec. 13. [465.7904] WAIVERS OF STATE RULES; POLICIES.
   Subdivision 1. Application. A state agency may apply to the board for a waiver from: (1) an
89TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 19, 2010                                        9711

administrative rule or policy adopted by the commissioner of management and budget that deals with
the state personnel system; (2) an administrative rule or policy of the commissioner of administration
that deals with the state procurement system; or (3) a policy of the commissioner of management
and budget that deals with the state accounting system. Two or more state agencies may submit a
joint application. A waiver application must identify the rule or policy at issue, and must describe
the improved outcome sought through the waiver.
    Subd. 2. Review process. (a) The board shall review all applications submitted under this
section. The board shall dismiss an application if it finds that the application proposes a waiver that
would result in due process violations, violations of federal law or the state or federal constitution,
or the loss of services to people who are entitled to them. If a proposed waiver would violate the
terms of a collective bargaining agreement effective under chapter 179A, the waiver is not effective
without the consent of the exclusive representative that is a party to the agreement. The board
may approve a waiver only if the board determines that if the waiver is granted: (1) services can
be provided in a more efficient or effective manner; and (2) services related to human resources
must be provided in a manner consistent with section 43A.01. In the case of a waiver from a
policy of the commissioner of management and budget, the board may approve the waiver only if
it determines that services will be provided in a more efficient or effective manner and that state
funds will be adequately accounted for and safeguarded in a manner that complies with generally
accepted government accounting principles.
    (b) Within 15 days of receipt of the application, the board shall send a copy of the application to:
(1) the agency whose rule or policy is involved; and (2) all exclusive representatives who represent
employees of the agency requesting the waiver. The agency whose rule or policy is involved may
mail a copy of the application to all persons who have registered with the agency under section
14.14, subdivision 1a.
    (c) The agency whose rule or policy is involved or an exclusive representative shall notify the
board of its agreement with or objection to and grounds for objection to the waiver within 60 days
of the date when the application was transmitted to the agency or the exclusive representative.
An agency's or exclusive representative's failure to respond under this paragraph is considered
agreement to the waiver.
    (d) If the agency or the exclusive representative objects to the waiver, the board shall schedule
a meeting at which the agency requesting the waiver may present its case for the waiver and the
objecting party may respond. The board shall decide whether to grant a waiver at its next regularly
scheduled meeting following its receipt of an agency's response, or the end of the 60-day response
period, whichever occurs first. If consideration of an application is not concluded at the meeting, the
matter may be carried over to the next meeting of the board. Interested persons may submit written
comments to the board on the waiver request.
   (e) If the board grants a request for a waiver, the board and the agency requesting the waiver
shall enter into an agreement relating to the outcomes desired as a result of the waiver and the
means of measurement to determine whether those outcomes have been achieved with the waiver.
The agreement must specify the duration of the waiver, which must be for at least two years and not
more than four years. If the board determines that an agency that has received a waiver is failing to
comply with the terms of the agreement, the board may rescind the agreement.
   Subd. 3. Board. For purposes of evaluating waiver requests involving rules or policies of the
9712                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [89TH DAY

commissioner of administration, the commissioner of administration may not participate in the
evaluation.
   Sec. 14. [465.7905] SERVICE BUDGET MANAGEMENT MODEL GRANTS.
    Subdivision 1. Application. One or more local units of government, an association of local
governments, the Metropolitan Council, a local unit of government acting in conjunction with
an organization or a state agency, an organization established by two or more local units of
government under a joint powers agreement, or a not-for-profit organization may apply to the
Board of Innovation for a grant to be used to develop models for innovative service budget
management. The application must specify a nonstate funding source for 25 percent of the total
cost of the proposal. The application to the board must state what other sources of funding have
been considered by the local units of government to implement the project and explain why it is
not possible to complete the project without assistance from the board. The board may not award
a grant if it determines that the local units of government could complete the project without
board assistance or if it determines the applicant has not specified a nonstate funding source for 25
percent of the total cost. A copy of the application must be provided by the units to the exclusive
representatives certified under section 179A.12 to represent employees who provide the service
or program affected by the application.
    Subd. 2. Proposals. Proposed models may provide options to local governments, neighborhood
or community organizations, other not-for-profit organizations, or individuals to redesign and
deliver services. In awarding grants under this section, the board must consider whether the
proposal:
   (1) expands consumer choices and opportunities;
   (2) shifts government toward an expanded role as a purchaser, rather than a provider, of services;
   (3) reduces administrative costs through statewide or regional contracting, or related
administrative efficiencies;
    (4) reduces administrative costs through the accumulation of multiple related services into a
single contract with one provider, or related administrative efficiencies; and
   (5) fosters entrepreneurial leadership in the public sector.
    Subd. 3. Requirements. A copy of the work product for which the grant was provided must
be furnished to the board upon completion, and the board may disseminate it to other local units of
government or interested groups. If the board finds that the model was not completed or implemented
according to the terms of the grant agreement, it may require the grantee to repay all or a portion
of the grant. The board shall award grants on the basis of each qualified applicant's score under
the scoring system in section 465.806. The amount of a grant under this section may not exceed
$250,000.
   Sec. 15. [465.805] INNOVATION CHALLENGE GRANTS.
   Two or more local units of government; an association of local governments; a local unit
of government acting in conjunction with the Metropolitan Council, an organization, or a state
agency; or an organization established by two or more local units of government under a joint
powers agreement may apply to the Board of Innovation for a grant to be used to meet the start-up

costs of providing shared services or functions. Agreements solely to make joint purchases are not
sufficient to qualify under this section. The application to the board must state what other sources
of funding have been considered by the local units of government to implement the project and
explain why it is not possible to complete the project without assistance from the board. The board
may not award a grant if it determines that the local units of government could complete the project
without board assistance. A copy of the application must be provided by the applicants to the
exclusive representatives certified under section 179A.12 to represent employees who provide the
service or program affected by the application.
    The proposal must include plans fully to integrate a service or function provided by two or more
local government units. A copy of the work product for which the grant was provided must be
furnished to the board upon completion, and the board may disseminate it to other local units of
government or interested groups. If the board finds that the grantee has failed to implement the plan
according to the terms of the agreement, it may require the grantee to repay all or a portion of the
grant. The board shall award grants on the basis of each qualified applicant's score under the scoring
system in section 465.806. The amount of a grant under this section may not exceed $100,000. A
grant may be made under this section only if an amount equal to 25 percent of the grant amount is
provided by nonstate sources.
   Sec. 16. [465.806] SCORING SYSTEM.
    In deciding whether to award a grant under section 465.7905 or 465.805, the board shall use the
following scoring system:
    (1) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application demonstrates
creative thinking, careful planning, cooperation, involvement of the clients of the affected service,
and commitment to assume risk.
    (2) Up to 20 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the proposed project is likely
to improve the quality of the service and to have benefits for other local governments.
    (3) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application's budget
provides sufficient detail, maximizes the use of state funds, documents the need for financial
assistance, commits to local financial support, and limits expenditures to essential activities.
    (4) Up to 20 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application reflects the
statutory goal of the grant program.
    (5) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the merit of the proposed project and the extent
to which it warrants the state's financial participation.
   (6) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the cost to benefit ratio projected for the proposed
project.
    (7) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the number of government units participating in
the proposal.
   (8) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the minimum length of time the application
commits to implementation.
   Sec. 17. [465.807] REPAYMENT OF GRANTS.
9714                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [89TH DAY

    Subdivision 1. Repayment procedures. Without regard to whether a grant recipient offered
to repay the grant in its original application, as part of a grant awarded under section 465.7905
or 465.805, the board may require the grant recipient to repay all or part of the grant if the board
determines the project funded by the grant resulted in an actual savings for the participating local
units of government. The grant agreement must specify how the savings are to be determined and
the period of time over which the savings will be used to calculate a repayment requirement. The
repayment of grant money under this section must not exceed an amount equal to the total savings
achieved through the implementation of the project multiplied by the total amount of the grant
divided by the total budget for the project and may not exceed the total amount of the original grant.
    Subd. 2. Bonus points. In addition to the points awarded to competitive grant applications under
section 465.806, the board shall award additional points to any applicant that projects a potential
cost savings through the implementation of its project and offers to repay part or all of the grant
under the formula in subdivision 1.
   Subd. 3. Use of repayment revenue. All grant money repaid to the board under this section is
appropriated to the board for additional grants authorized by sections 465.7905 and 465.805.
   Sec. 18. [465.808] RECEIPTS; APPROPRIATION.
    (a) The board may charge a fee for the use of services provided by the board's staff. The receipts
from fees charged under this section are deposited in a special revenue account and appropriated to
the board for services provided under sections 465.7901 to 465.808.
    (b) The board may accept gifts and grants. Money received under this paragraph is deposited
in a special revenue account and appropriated to the board for services provided under sections
465.7901 to 465.808.
   Sec. 19. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 6.80, is repealed.
   Sec. 20. EFFECTIVE DATE.
    Sections 1 to 19 are effective July 1, 2010, except that duties of the board under Minnesota
Statutes, section 465.7902, subdivision 2, clause (3), are effective July 1, 2011."
