Code, title 20, section 1078, whose terms are governed by United States Code, title 20, section

section 136A.101, subdivision 4.
    (e) "Maximum qualifying amount" is the allowance for tuition and fees calculated for the cost

the average of undergraduate tuition and required fees at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities

    Subd. 2. Credit allowed. (a) An eligible individual is allowed a credit against the tax due under
this chapter.
   (b) The maximum credit amount for an eligible individual equals the lesser of:
   (1) the amount the individual paid during the taxable year to pay principal and interest on
qualified education loans, not to exceed $4,000; or
   (2) the maximum qualifying amount.

of a married eligible individual, a credit is not allowed unless a joint income tax return is filed.
    Subd. 4. Credit carryover. If the credit provided under this section exceeds the tax liability of
the eligible individual for the taxable year, the excess amount of the credit may be carried over to
each of the ten taxable years succeeding the taxable year. The entire amount of the credit must be
carried to the earliest taxable year in which the amount may be carried. The unused portion of the
credit must be carried forward to the following taxable year. No credit may be carried to a taxable
year more than ten years after the taxable year in which the credit was earned.

inspectors neglect or fail to do their duty as prescribed in this section, the county agricultural

allowed in the notice, the local weed inspector has not complied as directed, the county agricultural
inspector or county-designated employee may consult with the commissioner to perform the duty
for the local weed inspector. A claim for the expense of doing the local weed inspector's duty
is a legal charge against the municipality in which the inspector has jurisdiction. The county

itemized statement of costs with the clerk of the municipality in which the work was performed.
The municipality shall immediately issue proper warrants to the county for the work performed. If
the municipality fails to issue the warrants, the county auditor may include the amount contained in
the itemized statement of costs as part of the next annual tax levy in the municipality and withhold
that amount from the municipality in making its next apportionment.

      8 18.91 and related rules. The published notice is legal and sufficient notice when an individual
notice cannot be served.

person who occupies the land, or the person responsible for or charged with the maintenance
of public land, giving specific instructions on when and how named noxious weeds are to be
controlled or eradicated. Individual notices provided for in this section must be served in the same
manner as a summons in a civil action in the district court or by certified mail. Service on a person

person, to be ascertained, if necessary, from the last tax list in the county treasurer's office.
    Subd. 3. Appeal of individual notice; appeal committee. (1) A recipient of an individual notice
may appeal, in writing, the order for control or eradication of noxious weeds. This appeal must be
filed with a member of the appeal committee in the county where the land is located within two
working days of the time the notice is received. The committee must inspect the land specified in
the notice and report back to the recipient and the inspector or county-designated employee who
issued the notice within five working days, either agreeing, disagreeing, or revising the order. The
decision may be appealed in district court. If the committee agrees or revises the order, the control
or eradication specified in the order, as approved or revised by the committee, may be carried out.

county-designated employee may hire a person to control or eradicate noxious weeds if the person
who owns the land, the person who occupies the land, or the person responsible for the maintenance
of public land has failed to comply with an individual notice or with the published general notice
when an individual notice cannot be served. The person hired must have authorization, in writing,

    Subd. 7. Expenses; reimbursements. A claim for the expense of controlling or eradicating
noxious weeds, which may include the costs of serving notices, is a legal charge against the county
in which the land is located. The officers having the work done must file with the county auditor a

verified and itemized statement of cost for all services rendered on each separate tract or lot of land.
The county auditor shall immediately issue proper warrants to the persons named on the statement
as having rendered services. To reimburse the county for its expenditure in this regard, the county
auditor shall certify the total amount due and, unless an appeal is made in accordance with section
18.84, enter it on the tax roll as a tax upon the land and it must be collected as other real estate taxes
are collected.
    If public land is involved, the amount due must be paid from funds provided for maintenance
of the land or from the general revenue or operating fund of the agency responsible for the land.
Each claim for control or eradication of noxious weeds on public lands must first be approved by
the commissioner of agriculture.

occupant if other than the owner, responsible for controlling noxious weeds did not comply with the
order of the inspector or county-designated employee.

funds obtained for the purposes in section 18.91 must be credited to the account. The money in the
account is annually appropriated to the commissioner to implement section 18.90.
   Sec. 39. [18.90] GRANT PROGRAM.
    (a) From funds available in the noxious weed and invasive plant species assistance account
established in section 18.89, the commissioner shall administer a grant program to assist
counties and municipalities and other weed management entities in the cost of implementing and
maintaining noxious weed control programs and in addressing special weed control problems. The
commissioner shall receive applications by counties, municipalities, weed management areas, and
weed management entities for assistance under this section and, in consultation with the Noxious
Weed Advisory Committee, award grants for any of the following eligible purposes:
   (1) to conduct applied research to solve locally significant weed management problems;
   (2) to demonstrate innovative control methods or land management practices which have the
potential to reduce landowner costs to control noxious weeds or improve the effectiveness of noxious
weed control;
   (3) to encourage the ongoing support of weed management areas;
    (4) to respond to introductions or infestations of invasive plants that threaten or potentially
threaten the productivity of cropland and rangeland over a wide area;
    (5) to respond to introductions or infestations of invasive plant species that threaten or potentially
threaten the productivity of biodiversity of wildlife and fishery habitats on public and private lands;
   (6) to respond to special weed control problems involving weeds not included in the list of
noxious weeds published and distributed by the commissioner;
    (7) to conduct monitoring or surveillance activities to detect, map, or determine the distribution
of invasive plant species and to determine susceptible locations for the introduction or spread of
invasive plant species; and
   (8) to conduct educational activities.
   (b) The commissioner shall select and prioritize applications for assistance under this section
based on the following considerations:
    (1) the seriousness of the noxious weed or invasive plant problem or potential problem addressed
by the project;
   (2) the ability of the project to provide timely intervention to save current and future costs of
control and eradication;
   (3) the likelihood that the project will prevent or resolve the problem or increase knowledge
about resolving similar problems in the future;
   (4) the extent to which the project will leverage federal funds and other nonstate funds;
   (5) the extent to which the applicant has made progress in addressing noxious weed or invasive
plant problems;

   (6) the extent to which the project will provide a comprehensive approach to the control or
eradication of noxious weeds;
   (7) the extent to which the project will reduce the total population or area of infestation of a
noxious weed;
   (8) the extent to which the project uses the principles of integrated vegetation management and
sound science; and
   (9) other factors that the commissioner determines to be relevant.
   (c) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a person of the duty or responsibility to
control the spread of noxious weeds on lands owned and controlled by the person.

    (b) No payments shall be made for ethanol production that occurs after June 30, 2010. A producer
of ethanol shall not transfer the producer's eligibility for payments under this section to an ethanol
plant at a different location.
    (c) If the level of production at an ethanol plant increases due to an increase in the production
capacity of the plant, the payment under paragraph (a) applies to the additional increment of
production until ten years after the increased production began. Once a plant's production capacity
reaches 15,000,000 gallons per year, no additional increment will qualify for the payment.
   (d) Total payments under paragraphs (a) and (c) to a producer in a fiscal year may not exceed
$3,000,000.
    (e) By the last day of October, January, April, and July, each producer shall file a claim for
payment for ethanol production during the preceding three calendar months. A producer that files a
claim under this subdivision shall include a statement of the producer's total ethanol production in
Minnesota during the quarter covered by the claim. For each claim and statement of total ethanol
production filed under this subdivision, the volume of ethanol production must be examined by an
independent certified public accountant in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
   (f) Payments shall be made November 15, February 15, May 15, and August 15. A separate
payment shall be made for each claim filed. Except as provided in paragraph (g), the total quarterly
payment to a producer under this paragraph may not exceed $750,000.
    (g) Notwithstanding the quarterly payment limits of paragraph (f), the commissioner shall make
an additional payment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to ethanol producers for the lesser of:
(1) 20 cents per gallon of production in the fourth quarter of the year that is greater than 3,750,000
gallons; or (2) the total amount of payments lost during the first three quarters of the fiscal year due
to plant outages, repair, or major maintenance. Total payments to an ethanol producer in a fiscal
year, including any payment under this paragraph, must not exceed the total amount the producer
is eligible to receive based on the producer's approved production capacity. The provisions of this
paragraph apply only to production losses that occur in quarters beginning after December 31, 1999.
    (h) The commissioner shall reimburse ethanol producers for any deficiency in payments
during earlier quarters if the deficiency occurred because of unallotment or because appropriated
money was insufficient to make timely payments in the full amount provided in paragraph (a).
Notwithstanding the quarterly or annual payment limitations in this subdivision, the commissioner
shall begin making payments for earlier deficiencies in each fiscal year that appropriations for
ethanol payments exceed the amount required to make eligible scheduled payments. Payments for
earlier deficiencies must continue until the deficiencies for each producer are paid in full, except
the commissioner shall not make a deficiency payment to an entity that no longer produces ethanol
on a commercial scale at the location for which the entity qualified for producer payments, or to
an assignee of the entity.
   (i) The commissioner may make direct payments to producers of rural economic infrastructure
with any amount of the annual appropriation for ethanol producer payments and rural economic
