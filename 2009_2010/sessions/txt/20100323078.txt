of the state under laws allowing the county board to classify and manage tax-forfeited lands held
by the state in trust for the local units as provided in section 281.25, the county board may decide
that some lands in public ownership should be retained and managed for public benefits while
other lands should be returned to private ownership. Parcels of land becoming the property of the
state in trust under law declaring the forfeiture of lands to the state for taxes must be classified
by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie as conservation or nonconservation. In
making the classification the board shall consider the present use of adjacent lands, the productivity
of the soil, the character of forest or other growth, accessibility of lands to established roads,
schools, and other public services, their peculiar suitability or desirability for particular uses and
the suitability of the forest resources on the land for multiple use,          ­ and sustained yield management.
The classification, furthermore, must: (1) encourage and foster a mode of land utilization that will
facilitate the economical and adequate provision of transportation, roads, water supply, drainage,
sanitation, education, and recreation; (2) facilitate reduction of governmental expenditures; (3)
conserve and develop the natural resources; and (4) foster and develop agriculture and other
industries in the districts and places best suited to them.

    (b) Whenever the county board deems it appropriate, the board may hold a meeting for the
purpose of reclassifying tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released from the trust. The
criteria and procedures for reclassification are the same as those required for an initial classification.
    (c) Before meeting for the purpose of classifying or reclassifying tax-forfeited lands, the county
board must give notice of its intent to meet for that purpose as provided in this paragraph. The notice
must be given no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days before the date of the meeting, provided
that if the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be given at least
14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The notice must be posted on a Web site. The
notice must also be mailed or otherwise delivered to each person who has filed a request for notice
of special meetings with the public body, regardless of whether the matter is considered at a regular
or special meeting. The notice must be mailed or delivered at least 60 days before the date of the
meeting. If the meeting is rescheduled, notice of the new date, time, and location must be mailed or
delivered at least 14 days before the date of the rescheduled meeting. The public body shall publish
the notice once, at least 30 days before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within
the area of the public body's authority. The board must also mail a notice by electronic means to
each person who requests notice of meetings dealing with this subject and who agrees as provided
in chapter 325L to accept notice that is mailed by electronic means. Receipt of actual notice under
the conditions specified in section 13D.04, subdivision 7, satisfies the notice requirements of this
paragraph.
    The board may classify or reclassify tax-forfeited lands at any regular or special meeting, as
those terms are defined in chapter 13D, and may conduct only this business, or this business as well
as other business or activities, at the meeting.
    (d) At the meeting, the county board must allow any person or agency possessing pertinent
information to make or submit comments and recommendations about the pending classification or
reclassification. In addition, representatives of governmental entities in attendance must be allowed
to describe plans, ideas, or projects that may involve use or acquisition of the property by that or
another governmental entity. The county board must solicit and consider any relevant components of
current municipal or metropolitan comprehensive land use plans that incorporate the area in which
the land is located. After allowing testimony, the board may classify, reclassify, or delay taking action
on any parcel. In order for a state agency or a governmental subdivision of the state to preserve its
right to request a purchase or other acquisition of a forfeited parcel, it may, at any time following
forfeiture, file a written request to withhold the parcel from sale or lease to others under subdivision
1a.

    (e) When classifying, reclassifying, appraising, and selling lands under this chapter, the county
board may designate the tracts as assessed and acquired, or may by resolution provide for the
subdivision of the tracts into smaller units or for the grouping of several tracts into one tract
when the subdivision or grouping is deemed advantageous for conservation or sale purposes. This
paragraph does not authorize the county board to subdivide a parcel or tract of tax-forfeited land
that, as assessed and acquired, is withheld from sale under section 282.018, subdivision 1.
    (f) A county board may by resolution elect to use the classification and reclassification
procedures provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), instead of the procedures provided in paragraphs
(b), (c), and (d). Once an election is made under this paragraph, it is effective for a minimum of
five years.
    (g) The classification or reclassification of tax-forfeited land that has not been sold or released
from the trust may be made by the county board using information made available to it by any
office or department of the federal, state, or local governments, or by any other person or agency
possessing pertinent information at the time the classification is made.
    (h) If the lands are located within the boundaries of an organized town or incorporated
municipality, a classification or reclassification and sale must first be approved by the town board
of the town or the governing body of the municipality in which the lands are located. The town
board of the town or the governing body of the municipality is considered to have approved the
classification or reclassification and sale if the county board is not notified of the disapproval of
the classification or reclassification and sale within 60 days of the date the request for approval
was transmitted to the town board of the town or governing body of the municipality. If the town
board or governing body disapproves of the classification or reclassification and sale, the county
board must follow the procedures in paragraphs (c) and (d), with regard to the parcel, and must
additionally cause to be published in a newspaper a notice of the date, time, location, and purpose
of the required meeting.
    (i) If a town board or a governing body of a municipality or a park and recreation board in a
city of the first class desires to acquire any parcel lying in the town or municipality by procedures
authorized in this section, it may file a written request under subdivision 1a, paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.

agency or a governmental subdivision of the state, a parcel of unsold tax-forfeited land must be
withheld from sale or lease to others for a maximum of six months. The request must be submitted
to the county auditor. Upon receipt, the county auditor must withhold the parcel from sale or lease
to any other party for six months and must confirm the starting date of the six-month withholding
period to the requesting agency or subdivision. If the request is from a governmental subdivision
of the state, the governmental subdivision must pay the maintenance costs incurred by the county
during the period the parcel is withheld. The county board may approve a sale or conveyance to
the requesting party during the withholding period. A conveyance of the property to the requesting
party terminates the withholding period.
    A governmental subdivision of the state must not make, and a county auditor must not act upon,
a second request to withhold a parcel from sale or lease within 18 months of a previous request for

that parcel. A county may reject a request made under this paragraph if the request is made more than
30 days after the county has given notice to the requesting state agency or governmental subdivision
of the state that the county intends to sell or otherwise dispose of the property.
    (b) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board, for their market value
as determined by the county board, to an organized or incorporated governmental subdivision of
the state for any public purpose for which the subdivision is authorized to acquire property o  ­­r.
For purposes of this section, "market value" means an estimate of the full and actual market value
of the parcel as determined by the county board. In making this determination, the board and the
persons employed by or under contract with the board in order to perform, conduct, or assist in the
determination, are exempt from the licensure requirements of chapter 82B.
    (c) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be released from the trust in favor of the taxing
districts on application o
                         ­­
                          f to the county board by a state agency for an authorized use at not less than
their market value as determined by the county board.
    (d) Nonconservation tax-forfeited lands may be sold by the county board to an organized or
incorporated governmental subdivision of the state or state agency for less than their market value
if:
   (1) the county board determines that a sale at a reduced price is in the public interest because a
reduced price is necessary to provide an incentive to correct the blighted conditions that make the
lands undesirable in the open market or the reduced price will lead to the development of affordable
housing; and
     (2) the governmental subdivision or state agency has documented its specific plans for correcting
the blighted conditions or developing affordable housing and the specific law or laws that empower
it to acquire real property in furtherance of the plans.
    If the sale under this paragraph is to a governmental subdivision of the state, the commissioner
of revenue must convey the property on behalf of the state by quit claim deed. If the sale under this
paragraph is to a state agency, the commissioner must issue a conveyance document that releases
the property from the trust in favor of the taxing districts.

recommendation of the county board. For purposes of this paragraph, "authorized public use"
means a use that allows an indefinite segment of the public to physically use and enjoy the property
in numbers appropriate to its size and use or that is for a public service facility. Authorized public
uses under this paragraph are limited to:
    (1) a road or right-of-way for a road;
   (2) a park that is both available to, and accessible by, the public that contains amenities such as
campgrounds, playgrounds, athletic fields, trails, or shelters;
    (3) trails for walking, bicycling, snowmobiling, or other recreational purposes, along with a
reasonable amount of surrounding land maintained in its natural state;

    (4) transit facilities for buses, light rail transit, commuter rail or passenger rail, including transit
ways, park-and-ride lots, transit stations, maintenance and garage facilities, and other facilities
related to a public transit system;
    (5) public beaches or boat launches;
    (6) public parking;
    (7) civic recreation or conference facilities; and
    (8) public service facilities such as fire halls, police stations, lift stations, water towers, sanitation
facilities, water treatment facilities, and administrative offices.
No monetary compensation or consideration is required for the conveyance, except as provided in
subdivision 1g, but the conveyance is subject to the conditions provided in law, including, but not
limited to, the reversion provisions of subdivisions 1c and 1d.
    (f) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited land
to a local governmental subdivision of the state by quit claim deed on behalf of the state upon the
favorable recommendation of the county board if the governmental subdivision has certified to the
board that before the forfeiture the subdivision was entitled to the parcel under a written development
agreement or instrument, but the conveyance failed to occur before forfeiture. No compensation or
consideration is required for, and no conditions attach to, the conveyance.
    (g) The commissioner of revenue shall convey a parcel of nonconservation tax-forfeited
land to the association of a common interest community by quit claim deed upon the favorable
recommendation of the county board if the association certifies to the board that before forfeiture
the association was entitled to the parcel under a written agreement, but the conveyance failed to
occur before forfeiture. No compensation or consideration is required for, and no conditions attach
to, the conveyance.
    (h) Conservation tax-forfeited land may be sold to a governmental subdivision of the state for
less than its market value for: (1) creation or preservation of wetlands; (2) drainage or storage
of storm water under a storm water management plan; or (3) preservation, or restoration and
preservation, of the land in its natural state. The deed must contain a restrictive covenant limiting
the use of the land to one of these purposes for 30 years or until the property is reconveyed back
to the state in trust. At any time, the governmental subdivision may reconvey the property to
the state in trust for the taxing districts. The deed of reconveyance is subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue. No part of a purchase price determined under this paragraph may be
refunded upon a reconveyance, but the amount paid for a conveyance under this paragraph may
be taken into account by the county board when setting the terms of a future sale of the same
property to the same governmental subdivision under paragraph (b) or (d). If the lands are unplatted
and located outside of an incorporated municipality and the commissioner of natural resources
determines there is a mineral use potential, the sale is subject to the approval of the commissioner
of natural resources.
   (i) A park and recreation board in a city of the first class is a governmental subdivision for the
purposes of this section.

    Subd. 1c. Deed of conveyance; form; approvals. The deed of conveyance for property
conveyed for ­a an authorized public use under the authorities in subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), must

property to the approved authorized public use for which it was conveyed, or an abandonment of
that use, except as provided in subdivision 1d.

the purposes of this paragraph, there is no failure to put the land to the authorized public use and
no abandonment of that use if a formal plan of the governmental subdivision, including, but not
limited to, a comprehensive plan or land use plan that shows an intended future use of the land for
the authorized public use.
    (b) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue on or after January
1, 2007, may be acquired by that governmental subdivision after 15 years from the date of the
conveyance if the commissioner determines upon written application from the subdivision that the
subdivision has in fact put the property to the authorized public use for which it was conveyed and
the subdivision has made a finding that it has no current plans to change the use of the lands. Before
conveying the property, the commissioner shall inquire whether the county board where the land is
located objects to a conveyance of the property to the subdivision without conditions and without
further act by or obligation of the subdivision. If the county does not object within 60 days, and the
commissioner makes a favorable determination, the commissioner shall issue a quit claim deed on
behalf of the state unconditionally conveying the property to the governmental subdivision. For
purposes of this paragraph, demonstration of an intended future use for the authorized public use in
a formal plan of the governmental subdivision does not constitute use for that authorized public use.
    (c) Property held by a governmental subdivision of the state under a conditional use deed
executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), by the commissioner of revenue before January
1, 2007, is released from the use restriction and possibility of reversion on January 1, 2022, if
the county board records a resolution describing the land and citing this paragraph. The county
board may authorize the county treasurer to deduct the amount of the recording fees from future
settlements of property taxes to the subdivision.
    (d) All property conveyed under a conditional use deed executed under subdivision 1a, paragraph
(e), by the commissioner of revenue is released from the use restriction and reverter and any use
restriction or reverter for which no declaration of reversion has been recorded with the county
recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, is nullified on the later of: (1) January 1, 2015; (2)
30 years from the date the deed was acknowledged; or (3) final resolution of an appeal to district
court under subdivision 1e, if a lis pendens related to the appeal is recorded in the office of the
county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, before January 1, 2015.

commissioner of revenue under subdivision 1a, paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h), and
subdivision 1d, paragraph (b), must be on a form approved by the attorney general and are prima

appraised by the county board of the county in which the parcels lie. The parcels may be reappraised
whenever the county board deems it necessary to carry out the intent of sections 282.01 to 282.13.
    (b) In an appraisal the value of the land and any standing timber on it shall be separately
determined. No parcel of land containing any standing timber may be sold until the appraised value
of the timber on it and the sale of the land have been approved by the commissioner of natural
resources. The commissioner shall base review of a proposed sale on the policy and considerations
specified in subdivision 1. The decision of the commissioner shall be in writing and shall state the
reasons for it. The commissioner's decision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply. The county may appeal the decision of the commissioner
in accordance with chapter 14.
     (c) In any county in which a state forest or any part of it is located, the county auditor shall

sold unless the requirements of this section respecting the separate appraisal of the timber and the
approval of the appraisal by the commissioner have been complied with. The commissioner may
waive the requirement of the 60-day notice as to any parcel of land which has been examined and
the timber value approved as required by this section.
       (d) If any public improvement is made by a municipality after any parcel of land has been
forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and the improvement is assessed in whole or in part
against the property benefited by it, the clerk of the municipality shall certify to the county auditor,
immediately upon the determination of the assessments for the improvement, the total amount that
would have been assessed against the parcel of land if it had been subject to assessment; or if the
public improvement is made, petitioned for, ordered in or assessed, whether the improvement is
completed in whole or in part, at any time between the appraisal and the sale of the parcel of land,
the cost of the improvement shall be included as a separate item and added to the appraised value of
the parcel of land at the time it is sold. No sale of a parcel of land shall discharge or free the parcel
of land from lien for the special benefit conferred upon it by reason of the public improvement until
the cost of it, including penalties, if any, is paid. The county board shall determine the amount, if
any, by which the value of the parcel was enhanced by the improvement and include the amount
as a separate item in fixing the appraised value for the purpose of sale. ­                                                  In

board of the county has adopted a resolution providing for their sale on terms, in which event the
resolution controls with respect to the sale. When the sale is made on terms other than for cash only

the balance must be paid in no more than ten equal annual installments, or (2) the payments must be
made in accordance with county board policy, but in no event may the board require more than 12
installments annually, and the contract term must not be for more than ten years. Standing timber

value of all standing timber or timber products on the lands at the time of purchase has been paid

auction for more than the appraised value, the amount bid in excess of the appraised value must be
allocated between the land and the timber in proportion to their respective appraised values. In that
case, standing timber or timber products must not be removed from the land until the amount of the
excess bid allocated to timber or timber products has been paid in addition to the appraised value of
the land. The purchaser is entitled to immediate possession, subject to the provisions of any existing
valid lease made in behalf of the state.
    For sales occurring on or after July 1, 1982, the unpaid balance of the purchase price is subject
to interest at the rate determined pursuant to section 549.09. The unpaid balance of the purchase
price for sales occurring after December 31, 1990, is subject to interest at the rate determined in
section 279.03, subdivision 1a. The interest rate is subject to change each year on the unpaid balance
in the manner provided for rate changes in section 549.09 or 279.03, subdivision 1a, whichever, is

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.01, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. County sales; notice, purchase price, disposition. The sale must commence at the time
determined by the county board of the county in which the parcels are located. The county auditor
shall offer the parcels of land in order in which they appear in the notice of sale, and shall sell them to
the highest bidder, but not for a sum less than the appraised value, until all of the parcels of land have
been offered. Then the county auditor shall sell any remaining parcels to anyone offering to pay the
appraised value, except that if the person could have repurchased a parcel of property under section
282.012 or 282.241, that person may not purchase that same parcel of property at the sale under
this subdivision for a purchase price less than the sum of all taxes, assessments, penalties, interest,
and costs due at the time of forfeiture computed under section 282.251, and any special assessments
for improvements certified as of the date of sale. The sale must continue until all the parcels are
sold or until the county board orders a reappraisal or withdraws any or all of the parcels from sale.
The list of lands may be added to and the added lands may be sold at any time by publishing the
descriptions and appraised values. The added lands must be: (1) parcels of land that have become
forfeited and classified as nonconservation since the commencement of any prior sale; (2) parcels
classified as nonconservation that have been reappraised; (3) parcels that have been reclassified as
nonconservation; or (4) other parcels that are subject to sale but were omitted from the existing list
for any reason. The descriptions and appraised values must be published in the same manner as
provided for the publication of the original list. Parcels added to the list must first be offered for
sale to the highest bidder before they are sold at appraised value. All parcels of land not offered for
immediate sale, as well as parcels that are offered and not immediately sold, continue to be held in
trust by the state for the taxing districts interested in each of the parcels, under the supervision of the
county board. Those parcels may be used for public purposes until sold, as directed by the county
board.

this subdivision if the auditor determines that a nonpublic sale will encourage the approval of sale
of the land by the city or town and promote its return to the tax rolls. If the physical characteristics
of the land indicate that its highest and best use will be achieved by combining it with an adjoining
parcel and the city or town has not adopted a local ordinance governing minimum area, shape,
frontage, or access, the land may also be sold pursuant to this subdivision. If the property consists
of an undivided interest in land or land and improvements, the property may also be sold to the
other owners under this subdivision. The sale of land pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject
to any conditions imposed by the county board pursuant to section 282.03. The governing body of
the city or town may recommend to the county board conditions to be imposed on the sale. The
county auditor may restrict the sale to owners of lands adjoining the land to be sold. The county
auditor shall conduct the sale by sealed bid or may select another means of sale. The land shall be
sold to the highest bidder ­ bu

   (5) continuing all currently available insurance coverage without change in coverage or

   (b) A finding by the court that there is a basis for issuing an ex parte order for protection
constitutes a finding that sufficient reasons exist not to require notice under applicable court rules
governing applications for ex parte relief.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (d), an ex parte order for protection shall be effective for a fixed period
set by the court, as provided in subdivision 6, paragraph (b), or until modified or vacated by the
court pursuant to a hearing. When signed by a referee, the ex parte order becomes effective upon
the referee's signature. Upon request, a hearing, as provided by this section, shall be set. Except as
provided in paragraph (d), the respondent shall be personally served forthwith a copy of the ex parte
order along with a copy of the petition and, if requested by the petitioner, notice of the date set for
the hearing. If the petitioner does not request a hearing, an order served on a respondent under this

accompanied by a form that can be used by the respondent to request a hearing and must include
a conspicuous notice that a hearing will not be held unless requested by the respondent within five
days of service of the order.
    (d) Service of the ex parte order may be made by published notice, as provided under subdivision
5, provided that the petitioner files the affidavit required under that subdivision. If personal service is
not made or the affidavit is not filed within 14 days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
If the petitioner does not request a hearing, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if
known, must be accompanied by the form for requesting a hearing and notice described in paragraph
(c). Unless personal service is completed, if service by published notice is not completed within 28
days of issuance of the ex parte order, the order expires.
    (e) If the petitioner seeks relief under subdivision 6 other than the relief described in paragraph
(a), the petitioner must request a hearing to obtain the additional relief.
   (f) Nothing in this subdivision affects the right of a party to seek modification of an order under
subdivision 11.

   Sec. 11. [629.75] DOMESTIC ABUSE NO CONTACT ORDER.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; description. (a) A domestic abuse no contact order is an order
issued by a court against a defendant in a criminal proceeding or a juvenile offender in a delinquency
proceeding for:
   (1) domestic abuse as defined in section 518B.01, subdivision 2;
  (2) harassment or stalking under section 609.749 when committed against a family or household
member as defined in section 518B.01, subdivision 2;
   (3) violation of an order for protection under section 518B.01, subdivision 14; or
   (4) violation of a prior domestic abuse no contact order under this subdivision or section
518B.01, subdivision 22.
    (b) A domestic abuse no contact order may be issued as a pretrial order before final disposition
of the underlying criminal case or as a postconviction probationary order. A domestic abuse no
contact order is independent of any condition of pretrial release or probation imposed on the
defendant. A domestic abuse no contact order may be issued in addition to a similar restriction
imposed as a condition of pretrial release or probation. In the context of a postconviction
probationary order, a domestic abuse no contact order may be issued for an offense listed in
paragraph (a) or for a conviction for any offense arising out of the same set of circumstances as an
offense listed in paragraph (a).
   (c) A no contact order under this section shall be issued in a proceeding that is separate from but
held immediately following one in which any pretrial release or sentencing issues are decided.
    Subd. 2. Criminal penalties. (a) As used in this subdivision "qualified domestic violence-related
offense" has the meaning given in section 609.02, subdivision 16.
    (b) A person who knows of the existence of a domestic abuse no contact order issued against
the person and violates the order is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (c) A person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor who knowingly violates this subdivision within
ten years of a previous qualified domestic violence-related offense conviction or adjudication of
delinquency. Upon a gross misdemeanor conviction under this paragraph, the defendant must
be sentenced to a minimum of ten days' imprisonment and must be ordered to participate in
counseling or other appropriate programs selected by the court as provided in section 518B.02.
Notwithstanding section 609.135, the court must impose and execute the minimum sentence
provided in this paragraph for gross misdemeanor convictions.
    (d) A person is guilty of a felony and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than
five years or to payment of a fine of not more than $10,000, or both, if the person knowingly
violates this subdivision: (1) within ten years of the first of two or more previous qualified domestic
violence-related offense convictions or adjudications of delinquency; or (2) while possessing a
dangerous weapon, as defined in section 609.02, subdivision 6. Upon a felony conviction under
this paragraph in which the court stays imposition or execution of sentence, the court shall impose
at least a 30-day period of incarceration as a condition of probation. The court also shall order

that the defendant participate in counseling or other appropriate programs selected by the court.
Notwithstanding section 609.135, the court must impose and execute the minimum sentence
provided in this paragraph for felony convictions.
    Subd. 3. Warrantless custodial arrest. A peace officer shall arrest without a warrant and take
into custody a person whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated a domestic
abuse no contact order, even if the violation of the order did not take place in the presence of the
peace officer, if the existence of the order can be verified by the officer. The person shall be held in
custody for at least 36 hours, excluding the day of arrest, Sundays, and holidays, unless the person
is released earlier by a judge or judicial officer. A peace officer acting in good faith and exercising
due care in making an arrest pursuant to this subdivision is immune from civil liability that might
result from the officer's actions.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2010, and applies to crimes committed
on or after that date.
   Sec. 12. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
   (a) The revisor of statutes shall replace references to Minnesota Statutes, section 518B.01,
subdivision 22, in statutes and rules with a reference to Minnesota Statutes, section 629.75.
   (b) The revisor of statutes shall make any cross-reference and technical language changes to
Minnesota Statutes made necessary by section 6.
   Sec. 13. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 518B.01, subdivision 22, is repealed.
