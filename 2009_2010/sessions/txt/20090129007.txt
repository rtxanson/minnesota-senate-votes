three years will not be required to make payment of the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding
the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land prior to the expiration of the three-year period
requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale in the year the land no longer qualifies requires
payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years;
sale during the second year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's
deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes for the prior year; and sale during the third year
the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes
shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or
no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the end of the three-year period, whichever comes
first, all deferred special assessments plus interest are payable in equal installments spread over
the time remaining until the last maturity date of the bonds issued to finance the improvement for
which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have matured, the deferred special assessments
plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to
the collection of these installments. Penalties are not imposed on any such special assessments if
timely paid.

7TH DAY]                                       THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2009                                                                      125

    Subd. 4. Determination of value. ­   (­

                                           ) The value of any real estate described in subdivision 3
shall upon timely application by the owner, in the manner provided in subdivision 8, be determined
solely with reference to its appropriate agricultural classification and value notwithstanding
sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11. Furthermore, the assessor shall not consider any added
values resulting from nonagricultural factors. In order to account for the presence of nonagricultural
influences that may affect the value of agricultural land, the commissioner of revenue shall develop
a fair and uniform method of determining agricultural values for each county in the state that are
consistent with this subdivision. The commissioner shall annually assign the resulting values to
each county, and these values shall be used as the basis for determining the agricultural value for
all properties in the county qualifying for tax deferment under this section.
