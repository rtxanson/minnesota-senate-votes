which the board is empowered to enforce and continued practice by the physician assistant would
create a serious risk of harm to the public. The suspension shall take effect upon written notice to
the physician assistant, specifying the statute or rule violated. The suspension shall remain in effect
until the board issues a final order in the matter after a hearing. At the time it issues the suspension
notice, the board shall schedule a disciplinary hearing to be held pursuant to the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    The physician assistant shall be provided with at least 20 days' notice of any hearing held
pursuant to this subdivision. The hearing shall be scheduled to begin no later than 30 days after the
issuance of the suspension order.
    Subd. 5. Evidence. In disciplinary actions alleging a violation of subdivision 1, clause (3)
or (4), a copy of the judgment or proceeding under the seal of the court administrator or of
the administrative agency which entered it shall be admissible into evidence without further
authentication and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the contents thereof.
    Subd. 6. Mental examination; access to medical data. (a) If the board has probable cause to
believe that a physician assistant comes under subdivision 1, clause (1), it may direct the physician
assistant to submit to a mental or physical examination. For the purpose of this subdivision, every

all objections to the admissibility of the examining physicians' testimony or examination reports
on the ground that the same constitute a privileged communication. Failure of a physician assistant
to submit to an examination when directed constitutes an admission of the allegations against the
physician assistant, unless the failure was due to circumstance beyond the physician assistant's
control, in which case a default and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or
presentation of evidence. A physician assistant affected under this subdivision shall at reasonable
intervals be given an opportunity to demonstrate that the physician assistant can resume competent
practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients. In any proceeding under this subdivision, neither
the record of proceedings nor the orders entered by the board shall be used against a physician
assistant in any other proceeding.
    (b) In addition to ordering a physical or mental examination, the board may, notwithstanding
sections 13.384, 144.651, or any other law limiting access to medical or other health data, obtain

care facility, program, or nonprofit organization as authorized under this subdivision is limited to
patients, students, and residents of the facility, program, or organization.
   (c) A collaborating dentist must be licensed under this chapter and may enter into a collaborative
agreement with no more than four dental hygienists unless otherwise authorized by the board. The
board shall develop parameters and a process for obtaining authorization to collaborate with more
than four dental hygienists. The collaborative agreement must include:

evaluation and treatment plan must occur prior to the provision of dental hygiene services;

which an examination by a dentist should occur;
   (3) copies of consent to treatment form provided to the patient by the dental hygienist;
    (4) specific protocols for the placement of pit and fissure sealants and requirements for follow-up
care to assure the efficacy of the sealants after application; and
    (5) a procedure for creating and maintaining dental records for the patients that are treated by
the dental hygienist. This procedure must specify where these records are to be located.
The collaborative agreement must be signed and maintained by the dentist, the dental hygienist, and
the facility, program, or organization; must be reviewed annually by the collaborating dentist and
dental hygienist; and must be made available to the board upon request.
    (d) Before performing any services authorized under this subdivision, a dental hygienist must
provide the patient with a consent to treatment form which must include a statement advising
the patient that the dental hygiene services provided are not a substitute for a dental examination
by a licensed dentist. If the dental hygienist makes any referrals to the patient for further dental
procedures, the dental hygienist must fill out a referral form and provide a copy of the form to the
collaborating dentist.
    (e) For the purposes of this subdivision, a "health care facility, program, or nonprofit
organization" is limited to a hospital; nursing home; home health agency; group home serving
the elderly, disabled, or juveniles; state-operated facility licensed by the commissioner of human

community clinic, tribal clinic, school authority, Head Start program, or nonprofit organization that
serves individuals who are uninsured or who are Minnesota health care public program recipients.
     (f) For purposes of this subdivision, a "collaborative agreement" means a written agreement with
a licensed dentist who authorizes and accepts responsibility for the services performed by the dental
hygienist. The services authorized under this subdivision and the collaborative agreement may be
performed without the presence of a licensed dentist and may be performed at a location other than
the usual place of practice of the dentist or dental hygienist and without a dentist's diagnosis and
treatment plan, unless specified in the collaborative agreement.

the Board of Dentistry. Such acts shall be performed under supervision of a licensed dentist. The
