vaginal birth as determined using the most recent calendar year for which complete claims data
is available. If a recipient is transported from a birth center to a hospital prior to the delivery, the
payment for facility services to the birth center shall be the lower of billed charges or 15 percent
of the average facility payment made to a hospital for the services provided for an uncomplicated
vaginal delivery as determined using the most recent calendar year for which complete claims data
is available.
    (c) Professional services provided by traditional midwives licensed under chapter 147D shall be
paid at the lower of billed charges or 65 percent of the rate paid to a physician performing the same
services. If a recipient is transported from a birth center to a hospital prior to the delivery, a licensed
traditional midwife who does not perform the delivery may not bill for any delivery services or
postpartum care. Services are not covered if provided by an unlicensed traditional midwife.
  (d) The commissioner shall apply for any necessary waivers from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services to allow birth centers and birth center providers to be reimbursed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2011, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later.
   Sec. 6. PREPAID HEALTH PLAN RATES.
    In negotiating the managed care contract rates for services rendered on or after January 1, 2011,
the commissioner of human services shall take into consideration and the rates shall reflect the
anticipated savings in the medical assistance program due to extending medical assistance coverage
to services provided in licensed birth centers, the anticipated use of these services within the medical
assistance population, and the reduced medical assistance costs associated with the use of birth
centers for normal, low-risk deliveries.
   Sec. 7. APPROPRIATION.
   $9,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2011 from the state government special revenue fund to the
commissioner of health to implement Minnesota Statutes, section 144.615. Base funding shall be
$7,000 in fiscal year 2012 and $7,000 in fiscal year 2013."

to a pregnant woman determined to be at risk of poor pregnancy outcome;
   (2) prenatal HIV risk assessment, education, counseling, and testing; and

    (d) The commissioner shall encourage, at the time of the child and teen checkup or at an episodic
care visit, the primary care health care provider to perform primary caries preventive services.
Primary caries preventive services include, at a minimum:
   (1) a general visual examination of the child's mouth without using probes or other dental
equipment or taking radiographs;
   (2) a risk assessment using the factors established by the American Academies of Pediatrics and
Pediatric Dentistry; and
   (3) the application of a fluoride varnish beginning at age 1 to those children assessed by the
provider as being high risk in accordance with best practices as defined by the Department of Human
Services.
At each checkup, if primary caries preventive services are provided, the provider must provide to
the child's parent or legal guardian: information on caries etiology and prevention; and information
on the importance of finding a dental home for their child by the age of 1. The provider must also
advise the parent or legal guardian to contact the child's managed care plan or the Department of
Human Services in order to secure a dental appointment with a dentist. The provider must indicate
in the child's medical record that the parent or legal guardian was provided with this information
and document any primary caries prevention services provided to the child."
