submission of a completed permit application. The commissioner of agriculture shall establish
management systems designed to achieve the goal.
    (b) The commissioner shall prepare semiannual permitting efficiency reports that include
statistics on meeting the goal in paragraph (a). The reports are due February 1 and August 1 each
year. For permit applications that have not met the goal, the report must state the reasons for not
meeting the goal, steps that will be taken to complete action on the application, and the expected
timeline. In stating the reasons for not meeting the goal, the commissioner shall separately identify
delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, or scientific or technical
disagreements or caused by the level of public engagement. The report must specify the number of
days from initial submission of the application to the day of determination that the application is
complete. The report for the final quarter of the fiscal year must aggregate the data for the year and
assess whether program or system changes are necessary to achieve the goal. The report must be
posted on the department Web site and submitted to the governor and the chairs of the house of
representatives and senate committees having jurisdiction over agriculture policy and finance.
   (c) The commissioner shall allow electronic submission of environmental review and permit
documents to the department.

336.9-102(a)(5) and includes a veterinarian's lien, breeder's lien, livestock production input lien,
temporary livestock production input lien, and feeder's lien under this section and section 514.966.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 514.966, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Temporary livestock production input lien; debtor in mediation. (a) A supplier
furnishing livestock production inputs in the ordinary course of business to a debtor who has filed a
mediation request under chapter 583 has a temporary livestock production input lien for the unpaid
retail cost of the livestock production input. A temporary perfected livestock production input lien
that attaches to livestock may not exceed the amount, if any, that the sales price of the livestock for
which the inputs were received exceeds the greater of the fair market value of the livestock at the
time the lien attaches or the acquisition price of the livestock. A temporary livestock production
input lien becomes effective when the agricultural production inputs are furnished by the supplier
to the purchaser.
    (b) A temporary livestock production input lien under this subdivision applies to livestock
production inputs provided that meet the needs of the debtor's livestock during the 45 days
following a mediation request under chapter 583.
    (c) A person who supplies livestock production inputs under this subdivision shall provide
a lien-notification statement as required under subdivision 3, paragraphs (b) and (c), but is not
subject to subdivision 3, paragraphs (d) to (f). A perfected temporary livestock production input
lien corresponding to the lien-notification statement has priority over any security interest of the
lender in the same livestock or their proceeds for the lesser of:
   (1) the amount stated in the lien-notification statement; or
    (2) the unpaid retail cost of the livestock production input identified in the lien-notification
statement, subject to any limitation in paragraph (a).
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 514.966, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Perfection. (a) An agricultural lien under this section is perfected if a financing
statement is filed pursuant to sections 336.9-501 to 336.9-530 and within the time periods set forth
in paragraphs (b) to (e).
    (b) A veterinarian's lien must be perfected on or before 180 days after the last item of the
veterinary service is performed.
   (c) A breeder's lien must be perfected by six months after the last date that breeding services are
provided the obligor.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (f), a livestock production input lien must be perfected by
six months after the last date that livestock production inputs are furnished the obligor.
    (e) A feeder's lien must be perfected on or before 60 days after the last date that feeding services
are furnished the obligor.
   (f) A temporary livestock production input lien, under subdivision 3a, must be perfected on or
before 60 days after the last date that livestock production inputs are furnished the obligor.

    Sec. 2. SUBMISSION TO VOTERS.
   The proposed amendment must be submitted to the people at the 2010 general election. The
question submitted must be:
    "Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to reaffirm the impartiality of the judiciary
by providing that all judges be appointed by the governor, with their continuation in office
determined at a retention election after a public, nonpartisan evaluation of their performance by a
judicial performance commission rather than be determined under the current system of contested
elections?
                                                                                    Yes .......

    Sec. 3. TRANSITION.
    A judge currently seated or elected at the time the constitutional amendment provided in section
1 is adopted shall complete the remainder of the judge's term as it existed before adoption of the
amendment. A judge who is elected at the 2010 general election will serve a term of six years.
Following completion of their terms, these judges are subject to the retention election process as
provided in the constitution and may file for retention following the procedures described in article
2.

    Sec. 12. [204D.30] RETENTION OF JUDGES.
   (a) Within the time period established by section 204B.09, a judge seeking to retain judicial office
shall file an affidavit of candidacy with the secretary of state. Judges who have filed an affidavit of
candidacy as provided in this section must be placed on the appropriate official ballot at the next
regular general election under a nonpartisan designation in the form provided in section 204B.36,
subdivision 4.
    (b) If a majority of those voting on the question votes "No," then upon the expiration of the

eight-year term, subject to removal as provided by the Minnesota Constitution. A judge who loses
a retention election is ineligible to be appointed to fill the resulting vacancy.
   (c) A judge seeking to retain judicial office is considered a candidate for election to that office.
A judicial retention election is not a ballot question for the purposes of the Minnesota Election law.
   Sec. 13. [480B.02] INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE COMMISSION.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. An Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission
is established and shall be an independent body not subject to the direct control of any branch of
government.
    Subd. 2. Purpose of commission. After public hearings, the commission shall adopt and
administer for all judges a process for evaluating judicial performance. The performance review
process must be designed to assist voters in evaluating the performance of judges standing for
retention, facilitate self-improvement of all judges, and promote public accountability of the
judiciary.
    Subd. 3. Composition; appointment of commission members. (a) The commission is
composed of 24 members. All members of the commission must be residents of Minnesota at the
time of their appointment and for the duration of their term. Sitting judges and public officials,
as defined in section 10A.01, subdivision 35, may not be appointed or serve on the commission.
Members of the commission who are attorneys at the time of their appointment must have been
admitted to practice before the Minnesota Supreme Court for not less than five years. Members of
the commission are eligible for reappointment up to two additional full terms.
   (b) Members of the commission must be appointed and serve as follows:
     (1) the governor shall appoint a total of eight members, no more than four of whom may be
attorneys at the time of their appointment. Gubernatorial appointees serve on the commission until
the governor who made the appointment leaves office or for a term of four years, whichever comes
first;
    (2) the Supreme Court shall appoint a total of eight members. The court shall designate one
of the appointees to serve as chair of the commission. No more than four of the appointees may be
attorneys at the time of their appointment. The Supreme Court's appointees serve on the commission
for a four-year term; and
    (3) the legislature shall appoint a total of eight members, no more than four of whom may be
attorneys at the time of their appointment. Legislative appointments must be made sequentially as
follows: the speaker of the house shall appoint one member, the majority leader of the senate shall
appoint one member, the minority leader of the house of representatives shall appoint one member,
and the minority leader of the senate shall appoint one member. After each legislative leader has
made one appointment as provided in this clause, a second round of appointments must be made in
the same sequence. Legislative appointees serve on the commission for a two-year term.
    In the case of a vacancy on the commission, the authority who appointed the member whose
seat has become vacant shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired
term.
   (c) In making appointments, the governor, Supreme Court, and legislative leaders must

consider the diversity of the state's population, as well as the importance of balanced geographic
representation, and appoint individuals of outstanding competence and reputation. The governor,
Supreme Court, and legislative leaders should consult with one another to ensure the requirements
of this paragraph are met.
    (d) Members shall perform their duties in an impartial and objective manner and shall base
their recommendations solely upon matters that are in the record developed by the commission. A
member who violates this paragraph may be removed from the commission by majority vote of the
commission's membership.
   (e) A member may be removed by the appointing authority at any time for cause, after notice
and hearing, or after missing three consecutive meetings. After a member misses two consecutive
meetings and before the next meeting, the secretary of the commission shall notify the member in
writing that the member may be removed if the member misses the next meeting. The chair of the
commission shall inform the appointing authority if a member misses three consecutive meetings.
   (f) Commission members shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses
associated with their work on the commission.
   (g) The commission shall appoint an executive secretary to provide administrative assistance
and coordinate the work of the commission.
    Subd. 4. Meetings and data. Meetings of the Independent Judicial Performance Commission are
subject to the requirements of chapter 13D, except that a meeting held to evaluate the performance
of a judge may only be closed to discuss issues related to the judge's health or allegations against the
judge that may be defamatory. The commission is subject to the requirements of chapter 13. Except
as otherwise provided in this section, data of the commission are public data pursuant to section
13.03, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 5. Standards and procedures. (a) The Independent Judicial Performance Commission
shall develop written standards, subject to approval of the Supreme Court in their entirety, by which
judicial performance is to be evaluated. The standards must be periodically updated and must include
knowledge of the law, procedure, integrity, impartiality, temperament, respect for litigants, respect
for the rule of law, administrative skill, punctuality, and communication skills. The commission may
not evaluate judicial performance based on substantive legal issues or opinions subject to standard
appellate processes.
   (b) The commission shall adopt procedures for collecting information and conducting reviews
and shall create and implement a program of periodic review of the performance of each judge. The
commission must request public comment on these procedures before their adoption.
    Subd. 6. Surveys. (a) Midway through a judge's term and again no fewer than nine months
before the date of the election for retention of the judge's position, the commission must distribute
anonymous survey forms eliciting performance evaluations of the judge to a representative sampling
of attorneys, litigants, other judges, and other persons who have been in direct contact with the
judge being evaluated and who have direct knowledge of the judge's judicial performance during
the evaluation period.
   (b) The commission must employ or contract with qualified individuals to prepare survey forms,
process responses, and compile the statistical reports of the survey results in a manner that ensures
9330                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [85TH DAY

confidentiality and accuracy.
    (c) Each survey conducted must seek evaluations in accordance with the written performance
standards adopted as provided in paragraph (a) and must solicit narrative comments regarding the
judge's performance. Narrative comments contained in a survey response are private data on the
judge, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12. Other data on an individual who completes or
responds to a survey form are private data on that individual.
   Subd. 7. Midterm evaluation. The commission shall evaluate each judge halfway through the
judge's term, as nearly as practicable, to provide feedback to the judge about the judge's performance
and to give the judge an opportunity for improvement. The commission shall adopt procedures for
conducting the midterm evaluation.
     Subd. 8. Retention-year evaluation. (a) In each year in which a judge has the opportunity to
file as a candidate for retention, the Independent Judicial Performance Commission must conduct
a final evaluation of the judge and determine whether the judge meets or does not meet judicial
performance standards. Upon completion of the evaluation, the commission must rate the judge
"well-qualified," "qualified," or "unqualified" for office. A rating of "unqualified" does not prohibit
a judge from seeking retention by the voters.
   (b) The final evaluation of a judge must include a public hearing and an opportunity for
submission of written public comments on the performance of a judge standing for retention.
Before accepting public comment and conducting a hearing, the commission must notify each
judge to be evaluated of the process for conducting the evaluation and the right of the judge to
submit written comments and appear in person at the hearing. The hearing and evaluation may be
conducted by a panel of commission members, as provided in subdivision 9.
    (c) A judge who does not intend to seek retention may waive the final evaluation process by
providing written notice to the commission affirming the judge's intention to not file as a retention
candidate for the judge's current office. If a judge waives the final evaluation under this paragraph,
the judge is not eligible to file an affidavit of candidacy for the office and is not eligible to be
appointed to fill the resulting vacancy.
     Subd. 9. Evaluation panels; review by full commission. (a) The evaluation of a judge may be
conducted by an evaluation panel. An evaluation panel is composed of five members, including at
least one member appointed by each branch of government, but otherwise chosen randomly. A panel
must report its results to the full commission. The full commission shall review a panel's evaluation
if the panel rates a judge unqualified, or if one panelist or three members of the commission request
a review within 15 days after the panel makes its report. The commission may overturn a panel's
rating. If a panel's report and rating is not reviewed, the determination of the panel is final. Decisions
of an evaluation panel or the full commission regarding a judge's performance are not subject to
judicial review.
    (b) If an evaluation is reviewed by the full commission, the commission shall provide written
notice to the affected judge. The judge has the right to submit written comments to the commission
and to appear and be heard by the commission before a final vote of the commission members
regarding the judge's performance.
   Subd. 10. Publication of evaluation results. Following the final evaluation of a judge, the
commission shall compile a factual report on the judicial performance of each judge intending to
85TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 2010                                      9331

stand for retention, including the final rating assigned to the judge's performance. The report must
be made available to the public at least one month before the time period established in section
204B.09 for filing an affidavit of candidacy with the secretary of state.
   Sec. 14. [480B.03] JUDICIAL RETENTION ELECTIONS.
    Judicial retention elections must be conducted consistent with the procedures established by law
for the administration of state general elections. Judges standing for retention must be placed on the
ballot as provided in section 204D.30.
   Sec. 15. [480B.04] REQUIREMENTS FOR SERVICE ON COMMISSIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Service on multiple commissions prohibited. A person may not simultaneously
serve on more than one commission established under this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Service until appointment of successors. Members of commissions established under
this chapter continue to serve until their successors have been appointed and qualified.
   Sec. 16. [480B.05] JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; FEE.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. The Supreme Court, through the Lawyer Registration Office,
may assess a judicial performance evaluation fee on each licensed attorney in the state. If imposed,
the fee must not exceed $15 and may only apply to attorneys actively engaged in the practice of law.
    Subd. 2. Creation of account. The Judicial Performance Evaluation Fee Account is created in
the special revenue fund. The state court administrator shall forward fees collected under subdivision
1 to the commissioner of management and budget who shall deposit them in the state treasury and
credit them to the account. The judicial performance evaluation fee collected under section 204B.11,
subdivision 3, must also be credited to the account. Money in the account is appropriated to the
Independent Judicial Performance Commission.
  Sec. 17. INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE COMMISSION; FIRST
MEETING; TRANSITION.
    (a) Initial appointments must be made to the Independent Judicial Performance Commission on
July 1, 2011.
    (b) Initial appointees shall serve for a term ending January 15, 2013, and may be considered for
reappointment as provided in this article at that time. The chair of the commission must convene
the first full meeting of the commission no later than August 1, 2011, and appoint a secretary for the
commission at that first meeting.
   (c) The commission is only required to conduct a final retention-year evaluation of each judge
whose term expires on or before January 5, 2015, but may conduct an initial evaluation of these
judges to provide an opportunity for improvement if the commission determines that it is prepared
and equipped to do so. Judges whose terms expire after January 5, 2015, are subject to both the
midterm and final retention-year evaluations required by this article.
   Sec. 18. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 204B.36, subdivision 5; and 204D.14, subdivision 3, are
