     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Budgets; form of notification. (a) Every board must publish revenue and
expenditure budgets for the current year and the actual revenues, expenditures, fund balances
for the prior year and projected fund balances for the current year in a form prescribed by the

An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract

employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration

of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
      (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
      (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
      (4) make reports required by the commissioner; and

this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for

(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.
       (c) A school district must set aside at least $3 per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit of the safe
schools levy proceeds for the purposes authorized under paragraph (a), clause (6). T                                    ­h ­­e­d­­s t­­c

The commissioner may not approve an exemption from federal mandates or a mandate related to

before September 15, each taxing authority, other than a school district, shall adopt a proposed
budget and shall certify to the county auditor the proposed or, in the case of a town, the final property

payable in the following year. Each school district that has agreed with its home county to delay

    (c) If the board of estimate and taxation or any similar board that establishes maximum tax levies
for taxing jurisdictions within a first class city certifies the maximum property tax levies for funds

have certified its levies for those taxing jurisdictions.
    (d) For purposes of this section, "taxing authority" includes all home rule and statutory
cities, towns, counties, school districts, and special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066.

Franconia, and No. 815, Prinsburg, are also special taxing districts for purposes of this section.
    (e) At the meeting at which the taxing authority adopts its proposed tax levy under paragraph (a)
or (b), the taxing authority shall announce the time and place of its subsequent regularly scheduled
meetings at which the budget and levy will be discussed and at which the public will be allowed
to speak. The time and place of those meetings must be included in the proceedings or summary
of proceedings published in the official newspaper of the taxing authority under sections 123B.09,
