improvement or by an improvement within the improvement program, or from tax increments, as
defined in section 469.174, subdivision 25, including obligations which are the general obligations
of the municipality, if the municipality is entitled to reimbursement in whole or in part from the
proceeds of such special assessments or tax increments and not less than 20 percent of the cost of
the improvement or the improvement program is to be assessed against benefited property or is to
be paid from the proceeds of federal grant funds or a combination thereof, or is estimated to be
received from tax increments;

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued

business, as defined in section 469.360, subdivision 9, is allowed a credit as determined under section
469.368 against the tax imposed by this chapter.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 290.067, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Amount of credit. (a) A taxpayer may take as a credit against the tax due from
the taxpayer and a spouse, if any, under this chapter an amount equal to the dependent care credit
for which the taxpayer is eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 21 of the Internal Revenue
Code subject to the limitations provided in subdivision 2 except that in determining whether the
child qualified as a dependent, income received as a Minnesota family investment program grant or
allowance to or on behalf of the child must not be taken into account in determining whether the
child received more than half of the child's support from the taxpayer, and the provisions of section
32(b)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply.
    (b) If a child who has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year is cared
for at a licensed family day care home operated by the child's parent, the taxpayer is deemed to
have paid employment-related expenses. If the child is 16 months old or younger at the close of the
taxable year, the amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the maximum limit for one

qualified individual under section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the child is older
than 16 months of age but has not attained the age of six years at the close of the taxable year, the
amount of expenses deemed to have been paid equals the amount the licensee would charge for the
care of a child of the same age for the same number of hours of care.
   (c) If a married couple:
   (1) has a child who has not attained the age of one year at the close of the taxable year;
   (2) files a joint tax return for the taxable year; and
    (3) does not participate in a dependent care assistance program as defined in section 129 of the
Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the actual employment related expenses paid for that child under
paragraph (a) or the deemed amount under paragraph (b), the lesser of (i) the combined earned
income of the couple or (ii) the amount of the maximum limit for one qualified individual under
section 21(c) and (d) of the Internal Revenue Code will be deemed to be the employment related
expense paid for that child. The earned income limitation of section 21(d) of the Internal Revenue
Code shall not apply to this deemed amount. These deemed amounts apply regardless of whether
any employment-related expenses have been paid.
    (d) If the taxpayer is not required and does not file a federal individual income tax return for the
tax year, no credit is allowed for any amount paid to any person unless:
    (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person are included on the return
claiming the credit; or
    (2) if the person is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
and exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the name and address of
the person are included on the return claiming the credit.
In the case of a failure to provide the information required under the preceding sentence, the
preceding sentence does not apply if it is shown that the taxpayer exercised due diligence in
attempting to provide the information required.
    In the case of a nonresident, part-year resident, or a person who has earned income not subject
to tax under this chapter including earned income excluded pursuant to section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clause (10) o­­r, (16), or (18), the credit determined under section 21 of the Internal Revenue
Code must be allocated based on the ratio by which the earned income of the claimant and the
claimant's spouse from Minnesota sources bears to the total earned income of the claimant and the
claimant's spouse.
   For residents of Minnesota, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision
19b, clauses (11) and (12), are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
   For residents of Minnesota, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."

$9,720 of earned income and 20 percent of earned income over $14,860 but less than $16,800. The
credit is reduced by 10.3 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater,
in excess of $17,890, but in no case is the credit less than zero.
    (e) For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage
calculated under section 290.06, subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).
    (f) For a person who was a resident for the entire tax year and has earned income not subject to tax
under this chapter, including income excluded under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clause (10) ­    o­

(16), or (18), the credit must be allocated based on the ratio of federal adjusted gross income reduced
by the earned income not subject to tax under this chapter over federal adjusted gross income. For
purposes of this paragraph, the subtractions for military pay under section 290.01, subdivision 19b,
clauses (11) and (12), are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
   For the purposes of this paragraph, the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal
Revenue Code is not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter."
    (g) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2001, and before December 31, 2004, the $5,770
in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted
for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $1,000 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns.

for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $2,000 for married taxpayers filing joint
returns.

$5,770 in paragraph (b), the $15,080 in paragraph (c), and the $17,890 in paragraph (d), after being
adjusted for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $3,000 for married taxpayers filing
joint returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2008, the $3,000 is adjusted annually for
inflation under subdivision 7.
    (j) The commissioner shall construct tables showing the amount of the credit at various income
levels and make them available to taxpayers. The tables shall follow the schedule contained in this
subdivision, except that the commissioner may graduate the transition between income brackets.

   Sec. 24. [469.366] INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX EXEMPTION.
    Subdivision 1. Application. An individual, estate, or trust operating a trade or business in a green
job opportunity building zone, and an individual, estate, or trust making a qualifying investment in
a qualified business operating in a green job opportunity building zone qualifies for the exemptions
from taxes imposed under chapter 290, as provided in this section. The exemptions provided under
this section apply only to the extent that the income otherwise would be taxable under chapter 290.
Subtractions under this section from federal taxable income, alternative minimum taxable income,
or any other base subject to tax are limited to the amount that otherwise would be included in the tax
base absent the exemption under this section. This section applies only to taxable years beginning
during the duration of the green job opportunity building zone.
    Subd. 2. Rents. An individual, estate, or trust is exempt from the taxes imposed under chapter
290 on net rents derived from real or tangible personal property used by a qualified business and
located in a zone for a taxable year in which the zone was designated a green job opportunity building
zone. If tangible personal property was used both within and outside of the zone by the qualified
business, the exemption amount for the net rental income must be multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days the property was used in the zone and the denominator
of which is the total days the property is rented by the qualified business.
    Subd. 3. Business income. An individual, estate, or trust is exempt from the taxes imposed under
chapter 290 on net income from the operation of a qualified business in a green job opportunity
building zone. If the trade or business is carried on within and without the zone and the individual is
not a resident of Minnesota, or the taxpayer is an estate or trust, the exemption must be apportioned
based on the zone percentage and the relocation payroll percentage for the taxable year. If the trade or
business is carried on within and without the zone and the individual is a resident of Minnesota, the
exemption must be apportioned based on the zone percentage and the relocation payroll percentage
for the taxable year, except the ratios under section 469.360, subdivision 6, clause (1), items (i)
and (ii), must use the denominators of the property and payroll factors determined under section
290.191. No subtraction is allowed under this section in excess of 20 percent of the sum of the
green job opportunity building zone payroll and the adjusted basis of the property at the time that
the property is first used in the green job opportunity building zone by the business.
   Subd. 4. Capital gains. (a) An individual, estate, or trust is exempt from the taxes imposed under
chapter 290 on:
    (1) net gain derived on a sale or exchange of real property located in the zone and used by a
qualified business. If the property was held by the individual, estate, or trust during a period when
the zone was not designated, the gain must be prorated based on the percentage of time, measured in
calendar days, that the real property was held by the individual, estate, or trust during the period the
zone designation was in effect to the total period of time the real property was held by the individual;
    (2) net gain derived on a sale or exchange of tangible personal property used by a qualified
business in the zone. If the property was held by the individual, estate, or trust during a period when
the zone was not designated, the gain must be prorated based on the percentage of time, measured in
calendar days, that the property was held by the individual, estate, or trust during the period the zone
40TH DAY]                             FRIDAY, APRIL 24, 2009                                        2743

designation was in effect to the total period of time the property was held by the individual. If the
tangible personal property was used outside of the zone during the period of the zone's designation,
the exemption must be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the
property was used in the zone during the time of the designation and the denominator of which is
the total days the property was held during the time of the designation; and
    (3) net gain derived on a sale of an ownership interest in a qualified business operating in the
green job opportunity building zone, meeting the requirements of paragraph (b). The exemption on
the gain must be multiplied by the zone percentage of the business for the taxable year prior to the
sale.
     (b) A qualified business meets the requirements of paragraph (a), clause (3), if it is a corporation,
an S corporation, or a partnership, and for the taxable year its green job opportunity building zone
percentage exceeds 25 percent. For purposes of paragraph (a), clause (3), the zone percentage must
be calculated by modifying the ratios under section 469.360, subdivision 6, clause (1), items (i) and
(ii), to use the denominators of the property and payroll factors determined under section 290.191.
Upon the request of an individual, estate, or trust holding an ownership interest in the entity, the
entity must certify to the owner, in writing, the green job opportunity building zone percentage
needed to determine the exemption.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 25. [469.367] CORPORATE FRANCHISE TAX EXEMPTION.
    (a) A qualified business is exempt from taxation under section 290.02, the alternative minimum
tax under section 290.0921, and the minimum fee under section 290.0922, on the portion of its
income attributable to operations within the zone. This exemption is determined as follows:
    (1) for purposes of the tax imposed under section 290.02, by multiplying its taxable net
income by its zone percentage and by its relocation payroll percentage and subtracting the result
in determining taxable income;
    (2) for purposes of the alternative minimum tax under section 290.0921, by multiplying its
alternative minimum taxable income by its zone percentage and by its relocation payroll percentage
and reducing alternative minimum taxable income by this amount; and
    (3) for purposes of the minimum fee under section 290.0922, by excluding property and payroll
in the zone from the computations of the fee or by exempting the entity under section 290.0922,
subdivision 2, clause (9).
    (b) No subtraction is allowed under this section in excess of 20 percent of the sum of the
corporation's green job opportunity building zone payroll and the adjusted basis of the property at
the time that the property is first used in the green job opportunity building zone by the corporation.
   (c) This section applies only to taxable years beginning during the duration of the green job
opportunity building zone.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.

3, multiplied by the number of full-time equivalent employees that the qualified business employs
in the green job opportunity building zone for the taxable year.

given.
   (b) "Full-time equivalent employees" means the equivalent of annualized expected hours of work

qualified business, less the amount of compensation attributable to any employee that exceeds the
ceiling calculated in section 469.318, subdivisions 2, paragraph (e), and 3.
    Subd. 3. Refundable. If the amount of the credit exceeds the liability for tax under chapter 290,
the commissioner of revenue shall refund the excess to the qualified business.
   Subd. 4. Appropriation. An amount sufficient to pay the refunds authorized by this section is
appropriated to the commissioner of revenue from the general fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
  Sec. 27. [469.369] REPAYMENT OF TAX BENEFITS BY BUSINESSES THAT NO
LONGER OPERATE IN A ZONE.
    Subdivision 1. Repayment obligation. A business must repay the total tax benefits listed
in section 469.365 received during the two years immediately before it (1) ceased to perform a
substantial level of activities described in the business subsidy agreement, or (2) otherwise ceased
to be a qualified business, other than those subject to the provisions of section 469.3691.
    Subd. 1a. Repayment obligation of businesses not operating in zone. Persons that receive
benefits without operating a business in a zone are subject to repayment under this section if the
business for which those benefits relate is subject to repayment under this section. Such persons are
deemed to have ceased performing in the zone on the same day that the qualified business for which
the benefits relate becomes subject to repayment under subdivision 1.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given.
   (b) "Business" means any person that received tax benefits enumerated in section 469.365.

following the year in which the auditor provided the statement under paragraph (c).
    (f) For determining the tax required to be repaid, a reduction of a state or local sales or use tax
is deemed to have been received on the date that the good or service was purchased or first put to a
taxable use. In the case of an income tax or franchise tax, including the credit payable under section
469.368, a reduction of tax is deemed to have been received for the two most recent tax years that
have ended prior to the date that the business became subject to repayment under this section. In the
case of a property tax, a reduction of tax is deemed to have been received for the taxes payable in
the year that the business became subject to repayment under this section and for the taxes payable
in the prior year.
     (g) The commissioner may assess the repayment of taxes under paragraph (d) any time within
two years after the business becomes subject to repayment under subdivision 1, or within any period
of limitations for the assessment of tax under section 289A.38, whichever period is later. The county
auditor may send the statement under paragraph (c) any time within three years after the business
becomes subject to repayment under subdivision 1.

    (h) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable
credits, for any part of the year in which the business becomes subject to repayment under this
section nor for any year thereafter. Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision
90, for any taxes payable in the year following the year in which the property became subject to
repayment under this section nor for any year thereafter. A business is not eligible for any sales tax
benefits beginning with goods or services purchased or first put to a taxable use on the day that the
business becomes subject to repayment under this section.
    Subd. 5. Waiver authority. (a) The commissioner may waive all or part of a repayment required
under subdivision 1, if the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of employment
and economic development and appropriate officials from the local government units in which
the qualified business is located, determines that requiring repayment of the tax is not in the best
interest of the state or the local government units and the business ceased operating as a result of
circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited to:
   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the
commissioner has waived repayment by the operating business under subdivision 1, unless the
person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone was a contributing
factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1;
   (2) the commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:
   (i) the person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone and the
business that operated in the zone are not related parties as defined in section 267(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31, 2007; and
    (ii) actions of the person were not a contributing factor in the qualified business becoming subject
to repayment under subdivision 1.

  Sec. 28. [469.3691] BREACH OF AGREEMENTS BY BUSINESSES THAT CONTINUE
TO OPERATE IN ZONE.
    (a) A "business in violation of its business subsidy agreement but not subject to section 469.369"
means a business that is operating in violation of the business subsidy agreement but maintains a
level of operations in the zone that does not subject it to the repayment provisions of section 469.369,
subdivision 1.
   (b) A business described in paragraph (a) that does not sign a new or amended business subsidy
agreement, as authorized under paragraph (h), is subject to repayment of benefits under section
469.369 from the day that it ceases to perform in the zone a substantial level of activities described

in the business subsidy agreement.
    (c) A business described in paragraph (a) ceases being a qualified business after the last day that
it has to meet the goals stated in the agreement. The commissioner may extend for up to one year
the period for meeting any goals provided in an agreement.
    (d) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable
credits, for any part of the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business under
paragraph (c), and thereafter. A business is not eligible for sales tax benefits beginning with goods
or services purchased or put to a taxable use on the day that it is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c). Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision 90, for any
taxes payable in the year following the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c), and thereafter.
     (e) A business described in paragraph (a) that wants to resume eligibility for benefits under
section 469.365 must request that the commissioner of employment and economic development
determine the length of time that the business is ineligible for benefits. The commissioner shall
determine the length of ineligibility by applying the proportionate level of performance under the
agreement to the total duration of the zone as measured from the date that the business subsidy
agreement was executed. The length of time must not be less than one full year for each tax benefit
listed in section 469.365. The commissioner of employment and economic development and the
appropriate local government officials shall consult with the commissioner of revenue to ensure
that the period of ineligibility includes at least one full year of benefits for each tax.
   (f) The length of ineligibility determined under paragraph (e) must be applied by reducing the
zone duration for the property by the duration of the ineligibility.
   (g) The zone duration of property that has been adjusted under paragraph (f) must not be altered
again to permit the business additional benefits under section 469.365.
    (h) A business described in paragraph (a) becomes eligible for benefits available under section
469.365 by entering into a new or amended business subsidy agreement, to be approved by the
commissioner, with the appropriate local government unit. The new or amended agreement must
cover a period beginning from the date of ineligibility under the original business subsidy agreement,
through the zone duration determined by the commissioner under paragraph (f). No exemption
of property taxes under section 272.02, subdivision 90, is available under the new or amended
agreement for property taxes due or paid before the date of the final execution of the new or amended
agreement, but unpaid taxes due after that date need not be paid.
   (i) A business that violates the terms of an agreement authorized under paragraph (h) is
permanently barred from seeking benefits under section 469.365 and is subject to the repayment
provisions under section 469.369 effective from the day that the business ceases to operate as a
qualified business in the zone under the second agreement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
  Sec. 29. [469.3692] PROHIBITION AGAINST AMENDMENTS TO BUSINESS

  Sec. 30. [469.3693] CERTIFICATION OF CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY FOR GREEN
JOBZ BENEFITS.
    (a) By October 15 of each year, every qualified business must certify to the commissioner of
revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, whether it is in compliance with
any agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.365. A
business that fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those still operating in
the zone, that submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later determines materially
misrepresents the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to the repayment provisions
under section 469.369 from January 1 of the year in which the report is due or the date that the
business became subject to section 469.369, whichever is earlier. Any such business is permanently
barred from obtaining benefits under section 469.365. For purposes of this section, the bar applies
to an entity and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an ownership interest of at least
20 percent of the entity.
    (b) Before the sanctions under paragraph (a) apply to a business that fails to submit the
certification, the commissioner of revenue shall send notice to the business, demanding that the
certification be submitted within 30 days and advising the business of the consequences for failing
to do so. The commissioner of revenue shall notify the commissioner of employment and economic
development and the appropriate green job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is
sent to a business under this paragraph.
   (c) The certification required under this section is public.
    (d) The commissioner of revenue shall promptly notify the commissioner of employment and
economic development of all businesses that certify that they are not in compliance with the terms
of their business subsidy agreement and all businesses that fail to file the certification.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
  Sec. 31. [469.3701] STATE AUDITOR; AUDITS OF GREEN JOB OPPORTUNITY
BUILDING ZONES AND BUSINESS SUBSIDY AGREEMENTS.
    The Office of the State Auditor may annually audit the creation and operation of all green job
opportunity building zones and business subsidy agreements entered into under sections 469.360
to 469.3693. To the extent necessary to perform this audit, the state auditor may request from the
commissioner of revenue tax return information of taxpayers who are eligible to receive tax benefits
authorized under section 469.365. To the extent necessary to perform this audit, the state auditor
may request from the commissioner of employment and economic development wage detail report
information required under section 268.044 of taxpayers eligible to receive tax benefits authorized
under section 469.365.
