Oversight, to which was referred
    S.F. No. 2354: A bill for an act relating to data practices; providing an administrative remedy
for certain data practices and open meetings law violations; providing civil penalties; appropriating
money; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapters 13; 13D; repealing Minnesota
Statutes 2008, sections 13.08, subdivision 4; 13D.06.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.072, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Effect. Opinions issued by the commissioner under this section are not binding on the
government entity or members of a body subject to chapter 13D whose data or performance of duties
is the subject of the opinion, but an opinion described in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), must be given
deference by a court or other tribunal in a proceeding involving the data. The commissioner shall
arrange for public dissemination of opinions issued under this section. This section does not preclude
a person from bringing any other action under this chapter or other law in addition to or instead of
requesting a written opinion. A government entity, members of a body subject to chapter 13D, or
person that acts in conformity with a written opinion of the commissioner issued to the government
entity, members, or person or to another party is not liable for compensatory or exemplary damages
or awards of attorneys fees in actions for violations arising under section 13.08 or 13.085, or for a
penalty under section 13.09 or for fines, awards of attorney fees, or any other penalty under chapter
13D. A member of a body subject to chapter 13D is not subject to forfeiture of office if the member
was acting in reliance on an opinion.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 13.08, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Action to compel compliance. (a) Actions to compel compliance may be brought under
section 13.085 or this subdivision. For actions under this subdivision, in addition to the remedies
provided in subdivisions 1 to 3 or any other law, any aggrieved person seeking to enforce the
person's rights under this chapter or obtain access to data may bring an action in district court to
compel compliance with this chapter and may recover costs and disbursements, including reasonable
attorney's fees, as determined by the court. If the court determines that an action brought under this
subdivision is frivolous and without merit and a basis in fact, it may award reasonable costs and
attorney fees to the responsible authority. If the court issues an order to compel compliance under
this subdivision, the court may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 against the government entity.
This penalty is payable to the state general fund and is in addition to damages under subdivision 1.
The matter shall be heard as soon as possible. In an action involving a request for government data
under section 13.03 or 13.04, the court may inspect in camera the government data in dispute, but
shall conduct its hearing in public and in a manner that protects the security of data classified as
not public. If the court issues an order to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court shall
forward a copy of the order to the commissioner of administration.
    (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty under this subdivision, the court or other
tribunal shall consider whether the government entity has substantially complied with general data
practices under this chapter, including but not limited to, whether the government entity has:
   (1) designated a responsible authority under section 13.02, subdivision 16;
7206                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [69TH DAY

   (2) designated a data practices compliance official under section 13.05, subdivision 13;
   (3) prepared the public document that names the responsible authority and describes the
records and data on individuals that are maintained by the government entity under section 13.05,
subdivision 1;
    (4) developed public access procedures under section 13.03, subdivision 2; procedures to
guarantee the rights of data subjects under section 13.05, subdivision 8; and procedures to ensure
that data on individuals are accurate and complete and to safeguard the data's security under section
13.05, subdivision 5;
   (5) acted in conformity with an opinion issued under section 13.072 that was sought by a
government entity or another person; or
    (6) provided ongoing training to government entity personnel who respond to requests under
this chapter.
    (c) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff who has brought an
action under this subdivision if the government entity that is the defendant in the action was also
the subject of a written opinion issued under section 13.072 and the court finds that the opinion is
directly related to the cause of action being litigated and that the government entity did not act in
conformity with the opinion.
   Sec. 3. [13.085] ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. As used in this section, "office" means the Office of Administrative
Hearings.
    Subd. 2. Complaints. (a) A complaint alleging a violation of this chapter for which an order to
compel compliance is requested may be filed with the office. An action to compel compliance does
not include procedures pursuant to section 13.04, subdivision 4 or 4a. An action may not be filed
under this section in matters involving requests for educational data classified under section 13.32.
    (b) The complaint must be filed with the office within two years after the occurrence of the act
or failure to act that is the subject of the complaint, except that if the act or failure to act involves
concealment or misrepresentation that could not be discovered during that period, the complaint may
be filed with the office within one year after the concealment or misrepresentation is discovered.
    (c) The complaint must be made in writing, submitted under oath, and detail the factual basis
for the claim that a violation of law has occurred. The office may prescribe a standard form for the
complaint. The complaint must be accompanied by a filing fee of $1,000 or a bond to guarantee the
payment of this fee.
    (d) Upon receipt of a filed complaint, the office must immediately notify the respondent and, if
known, the applicable responsible authority, if the responsible authority is not otherwise named as
the respondent. The office must provide the respondent with a copy of the complaint by the most
expeditious means available. Notice to a responsible authority must be delivered by certified mail.
The office must also notify, to the extent practicable, any individual or entity that is the subject of
all or part of the data in dispute.
   (e) The office must notify the commissioner of administration of an action filed under this
69TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MARCH 1, 2010                                           7207

section. Proceedings under this section must be dismissed if a request for an opinion from the
commissioner was accepted on the matter under section 13.072 before the complaint was filed, and
the complainant's filing fee must be refunded.
    (f) The respondent must file a response to the complaint within 15 business days of receipt of
the notice. For good cause shown, the office may extend the time for filing a response.
     Subd. 3. Probable cause review. (a) The chief administrative law judge must assign an
administrative law judge to review each complaint. Within 20 business days after a response
is filed, or the respondent's time to file the response, including any extension, has expired, the
administrative law judge must make a preliminary determination for its disposition as follows:
    (1) if the administrative law judge determines that the complaint and any timely reply of the
respondent agency do not present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has
occurred, the complaint must be dismissed; or
    (2) if the administrative law judge determines that the complaint and any timely reply of the
respondent agency do present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has occurred,
the judge must schedule a hearing as provided in subdivision 4.
  (b) The office must notify all parties of the determination made under paragraph (a). The notice
must provide as follows:
    (1) if the complaint is scheduled for a hearing, the notice must identify the time and place of
the hearing and inform all parties that they may submit evidence, affidavits, documentation, and
argument for consideration by the administrative law judge; or
    (2) if the complaint is dismissed for failure to present sufficient facts to believe that a violation
of this chapter has occurred, the notice must inform the parties of the right of the complainant to
seek reconsideration of the decision on the record by the chief administrative law judge, as provided
in paragraph (c).
   (c) A petition for reconsideration may be filed no later than five business days after a complaint is
dismissed for failure to present sufficient facts to believe that a violation of this chapter has occurred.
The chief administrative law judge must review the petition and make a final ruling within ten
business days after its receipt. If the chief administrative law judge determines that the assigned
administrative law judge made a clear error, the chief administrative law judge must schedule the
matter for a hearing as provided in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 4. Hearing; procedure. (a) A hearing on a complaint must be held within 30 business
days after the parties are notified that a hearing will be held. An oral hearing to resolve questions
of law may be waived upon consent of all parties and the presiding administrative law judge. For
good cause shown, the judge may delay the date of a hearing by no more than ten business days.
The judge may continue a hearing to enable the parties to submit additional evidence or testimony.
   (b) The administrative law judge must consider any evidence and argument submitted until the
hearing record is closed, including affidavits and documentation.
    (c) All hearings, and any records relating to the hearing, must be open to the public, except that
the judge may inspect in camera any government data in dispute and shall otherwise conduct the
hearing and maintain records in a manner that protects the security of data classified or alleged to
7208                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [69TH DAY

be classified as not public. A hearing may be conducted by conference telephone call or interactive
audio/video system, at the discretion of the presiding judge, and upon consent of all parties.
    Subd. 5. Disposition. (a) Following a hearing, the judge must determine whether the violation
alleged in the complaint occurred and must make at least one of the following dispositions. The
judge may:
   (1) dismiss the complaint;
   (2) find that an act or failure to act constituted a violation of this chapter;
   (3) impose a civil penalty against the respondent of up to $300;
    (4) issue an order compelling the respondent to comply with a provision of law that has been
violated, including the establishment of a deadline for production of data, if necessary; and
   (5) refer the complaint to the appropriate prosecuting authority for consideration of criminal
charges.
    (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty, the office shall consider the factors described
in section 13.08, subdivision 4.
    (c) The judge must dispose of a complaint within ten business days after the hearing record
closes. The chief administrative law judge shall provide for public dissemination of orders issued
under this section. If the judge determines that a government entity has violated a provision of
law and issues an order to compel compliance, the office shall forward a copy of the order to the
commissioner of administration. Any order issued pursuant to this section is enforceable through
the district court for the district in which the respondent is located.
    (d) A party aggrieved by a final decision on a complaint filed under this section is entitled to
judicial review as provided in sections 14.63 to 14.69. Proceedings on a complaint are not a contested
case within the meaning of chapter 14 and are not otherwise governed by chapter 14.
   (e) A decision of the office under this section is not controlling in any subsequent action on the
same matter for damages or other relief brought in district court.
    (f) A government entity or person that releases not public data pursuant to an order under this
section is immune from civil and criminal liability for that release. A government entity or person
that acts in conformity with an order issued under this section to the government entity or to any
other person is not liable for compensatory or exemplary damage or awards of attorney fees for
acting in conformity with that order in actions under this section or section 13.08, or for a penalty
under section 13.09.
    Subd. 6. Costs; attorney fees. (a) A rebuttable presumption shall exist that a complainant who
substantially prevails on the merits in an action brought under this section is entitled to an award
of reasonable attorney fees, not to exceed $5,000. An award of attorneys fees may be denied if the
judge determines that the violation is merely technical or that there is a genuine uncertainty about
the meaning of the governing law.
    (b) Reasonable attorney fees, not to exceed $5,000, must be awarded to a substantially prevailing
plaintiff if the government entity that is the respondent in the action was also the subject of a written
opinion issued under section 13.072 and the administrative law judge finds that the opinion is directly

related to the matter in dispute and that the government entity did not act in conformity with the
opinion.
   (c) The office shall refund the filing fee of a substantially prevailing complainant in full, less
$50, and the office's costs in conducting the matter shall be billed to the respondent, not to exceed
$1,000.
    (d) A complainant that does not substantially prevail on the merits shall be entitled to a refund
of the filing fee, less any costs incurred by the office in conducting the matter.
    (e) If the administrative law judge determines that a complaint is frivolous, or brought for
purposes of harassment, the judge must order that the complainant pay the respondent's reasonable
attorney fees, not to exceed $5,000. The complainant shall not be entitled to a refund of the filing
fee.
    Subd. 7. Special account; appropriation. Proceeds collected by the office from filing fees and
bonds submitted under this section shall be deposited into a special account and are appropriated to
the office for use in administering the requirements of this section.

used to replace a missing limb, appendage, or other external human body part including an artificial
7214                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [69TH DAY

limb, hand, or foot, and is deemed medically necessary by a prescribing physician or licensed health
care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies,
and services. For purposes of this section, prosthesis includes any repair or replacement of the
device and may be furnished only by an accredited facility in comprehensive prosthetic services, or
a credentialed clinician who is certified or licensed.
    (b) "Prosthetics" means the science and practice of evaluation, measuring, designing,
fabricating, assembling, fitting, aligning, adjusting, or servicing, as well as providing the initial
training necessary to accomplish the fitting of, a prosthesis through the replacement of external
parts of a human body lost due to amputation or congenital deformities or absences. The practice
of prosthetics also includes the generation of an image, form, or mold that replicates the patient's
body segment and that requires rectification of dimensions, contours, and volumes for use in
the design and fabrication of a socket to accept a residual anatomic limb to, in turn, create an
artificial appendage that is designed either to support body weight or to improve or restore function
or anatomical appearance, or both. Involved in the practice of prosthetics is observational gait
analysis and clinical assessment of the requirements necessary to refine and mechanically fix the
relative position of various parts of the prosthesis to maximize function, stability, and safety of
the patient. The practice of prosthetics includes providing and continuing patient care in order to
assess the prosthetic device's effect on the patient's tissues and to assure proper fit and function of
the prosthetic device by periodic evaluation.
   (c) "Orthosis" means:
    (1) an external medical device that is custom-fabricated or custom-fitted to a specific patient
based on the patient's unique physical condition and is applied to a part of the body to correct a
deformity, provide support and protection, restrict motion, improve function, or relieve symptoms
of a disease, syndrome, injury, or postoperative condition and is deemed medically necessary by a
prescribing physician or licensed health care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe
orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services; and
   (2) any repair or replacement of the device that is furnished by an accredited facility in
comprehensive orthotic services, or by a credentialed clinician who is certified or licensed.
   (d) "Orthotics" means:
    (1) the science and practice of evaluating, measuring, designing, fabricating, assembling, fitting,
adjusting, or servicing and providing the initial training necessary to accomplish the fitting of an
orthotic device for the support, correction, or alleviation of a neuromuscular or musculoskeletal
dysfunction, disease, injury, or deformity;
   (2) evaluation, treatment, and consultation;
   (3) basic observation of gait and postural analysis;
   (4) assessing and designing orthosis to maximize function and provide support and alignment
necessary to prevent or correct a deformity or to improve the safety and efficiency of mobility and
locomotion;
   (5) continuing patient care to assess the effect on the patient's tissues; and
   (6) proper fit and function of the orthotic device by periodic evaluation.

devices, supplies, and services that are the most appropriate model deemed medically necessary
by the prescribing physician or licensed health care prescriber who has authority in this state to
prescribe orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services, and includes the design, fabrication,
material and component selection, and measurements, fittings, static and dynamic alignments and
device maintenance, including repair of the device.
    (b) A health plan shall not impose any annual or lifetime dollar maximum on coverage for
orthotic and prosthetics that is less than the annual or lifetime dollar maximum that applies generally
to all terms and services covered under the plan.
    (c) The orthotic and prosthetic coverage required may not be subject to a deductible,
co-payment, or coinsurance provision that is less favorable to a covered individual than the
deductible, co-payment, or coinsurance provisions that apply generally to other nonprimary care
items and services under the health plan.
    (d) Reimbursement for orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services must be equal to
the reimbursement of other contracted medical services between an accredited facility and a health
plan or state-funded medical insurance plan, and coverage provisions may not be more restrictive
than those that apply to other benefits under the plan.
   (e) Coverage for orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services must not be subject to
any limitations for preexisting conditions.
   (f) Coverage for orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services must include complex and

or replacement of an orthotic or prosthetic device that is determined medically necessary by a
prescribing physician or licensed health care prescriber who has authority in this state to prescribe
orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services to restore or maintain the ability to complete
activities of daily living or essential job-related activities.
   Subd. 5. Accredited facility. Orthotic and prosthetic devices, supplies, and services must be
provided by an accredited facility in comprehensive orthotic and prosthetic services and prescribed

person who provided the premarital education on their letterhead confirming that it was received.
The premarital education must be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's
designee, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized
to practice marriage and family therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use
of a premarital inventory and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.
  (d) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, .......................... (name of educator), confirm that .......................... (names of both parties)
received at least 12 hours of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory
and the teaching of communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained
minister, a person authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a
person licensed to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (e) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay

    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request."

It is recommended that the single-section used manufactured home being reinstalled follow the
instructions in the manufacturer's installation manual. By signing this notice, the purchaser(s) are
acknowledging they have elected to use footings placed above the local frost line in accordance with
the Minnesota State Building Code.
The seller has explained the differences between the manufacturer's installation instructions and
the installation system selected by the purchaser(s) with respect to possible effects of frost on the
manufactured home.
The purchaser(s) acknowledge by signing this notice that there is no manufacturer's original
warranty remaining on the home and recognize that any other extended or ancillary warranty could
be adversely affected if any applicable warranty stipulates that the home be installed in accordance
with the manufacturer's installation manual to remain effective.
After the reinstallation of the manufactured home, it is highly recommended that the purchaser(s)
have a licensed manufactured home installer recheck the home's installation for any releveling needs
or anchoring system adjustments each freeze-thaw cycle.
The purchaser(s) of the used manufactured home described below that is being reinstalled
acknowledge they have read this notice and have been advised to contact the manufacturer of the
home and/or the Department of Labor and Industry if they desire additional information before
signing this notice. It is the intent of this notice to inform the purchaser(s) that the purchaser(s)
elected not to use a frost-protected foundation system for the reinstallation of the manufactured
home as originally required by the home's installation manual.
