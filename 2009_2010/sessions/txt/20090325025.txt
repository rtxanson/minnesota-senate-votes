       to help "save" your home.
       Remember: It is important that you learn as much as you can about foreclosure and your
       situation. Find out about all your options before you make any agreements with anyone about
       the foreclosure of your home.
       Getting Help
       As soon as possible, you should contact your lender at the above number to talk about things
       you might be able to do to prevent foreclosure. You should also consider contacting the
       foreclosure prevention counselor in your area. A foreclosure prevention counselor can answer
       your questions, offer free advice, and help you create a plan which makes sense for your
       situation.
       Contact the Minnesota Home Ownership Center at 651-659-9336 or 866-462-6466 or
       www.hocmn.org to get the phone number and location of the nearest counseling organization.
       Call today. The longer you wait, the fewer options you may have for a desirable result.
       Information About the Foreclosure Process
       You do not need to move at the time of the sheriff's sale. After the sheriff's sale you have
       the right to "redeem." Redeem means that you pay off the entire loan amount plus fees to
       keep your house. You can keep living in your home for a period of time. This is called a
       "redemption period." The redemption period is [insert number of months] months after the
       sheriff's sale. This redemption period is your chance to try and sell your home or refinance
       it with a different loan. You can also pay the redemption amount with any other funds you
       have available. At the end of the redemption period you will have to leave your home. If you
       do not, the person or company that bid on your home at the sheriff's sale has the right to file
       an eviction against you in district court.
    Reinstatement: AS OF [insert date], this lender says that you owe $[insert dollar amount] to
bring your mortgage up to date. You must pay this amount plus any regular loan payments due
between now and the sheriff's sale to keep your house from going through a sheriff's sale. The
sheriff's sale is scheduled for [insert date] at [insert time] at [insert place]. After the sheriff's sale,
you may choose to reinstate your mortgage at any time before the redemption period of [insert
applicable redemption period] ends, unless you previously reinstated your mortgage."

   580.12 CERTIFICATE OF SALE; RECORD; EFFECT.

the purchaser's assignee of all the right, title, and interest of the mortgagor in and to the premises
named therein at the date of such mortgage, without any other conveyance. A certificate must

582.031, and any interest or installment of principal upon any prior or superior mortgage, lien, or
contract for deed in default or that becomes due during the period of redemption. In all such cases,
the costs so paid and claimed due, with interest, shall be a part of the sum required to be paid to
redeem from such sale. No other costs, fees, interest, or other amount may be added to the amount
necessary to redeem.
   Sec. 8. [582.21] TAXES TO BE PAID IN FULL.

   Page 2, after line 16, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245.4835, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Required expenditures. (a) Counties must maintain a level of expenditures for
mental health services under sections 245.461 to 245.484 and 245.487 to 245.4889 so that each year's
county expenditures are at least equal to that county's average expenditures for those services for
calendar years 2004 and 2005. The commissioner will adjust each county's base level for minimum
expenditures in each year by the amount of any increase or decrease in that county's state grants or
other noncounty revenues for mental health services under sections 245.461 to 245.484 and 245.487
to 245.4889.
   (b) In order to simplify administration and improve budgeting predictability, the commissioner:
   (1) shall use each county's actual prior year revenues to adjust the county's minimum required
expenditures for the coming year;
   (2) may use more current information regarding major changes in revenues if the change is
known early enough to allow counties time to adjust their budgets;
25TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2009                                           979

   (3) shall allocate each county's revenues proportionally across applicable expenditures;
    (4) shall adjust each county's base to allow for major changes in state or federal block grants or
other revenues that can be used for mental health services, but are not dedicated to mental health;
in this case, the commissioner shall calculate the mental health share of total county expenditures
that were eligible to be funded from that revenue source in the base year, and use that mental health
share to allocate the change in those revenues to mental health. This clause applies to changes in
revenues that are beyond the county's control; and
  (5) may adjust a county's base if the county's population is declining and the county's per capita
mental health expenditures are higher than the state average.
   (c) Paragraph (b), clause (4) expires December 31, 2011.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245.4835, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Failure to maintain expenditures. (a) If a county does not comply with subdivision 1,
the commissioner shall require the county to develop a corrective action plan according to a format
and timeline established by the commissioner. If the commissioner determines that a county has not
developed an acceptable corrective action plan within the required timeline, or that the county is
not in compliance with an approved corrective action plan, the protections provided to that county
under section 245.485 do not apply.
   (b) The commissioner shall consider the following factors to determine whether to approve a
county's corrective action plan:
   (1) the degree to which a county is maximizing revenues for mental health services from
noncounty sources;
    (2) the degree to which a county is expanding use of alternative services that meet mental
health needs, but do not count as mental health services within existing reporting systems. If
approved by the commissioner, the alternative services must be included in the county's base as
well as subsequent years. The commissioner's approval for alternative services must be based on
the following criteria:
    (i) the service must be provided to children with emotional disturbance or adults with mental
illness;
   (ii) the services must be based on an individual treatment plan or individual community support
plan as defined in the Comprehensive Mental Health Act; and
   (iii) the services must be supervised by a mental health professional and provided by staff
who meet the staff qualifications defined in sections 256B.0943, subdivision 7, and 256B.0622,
subdivision 5.
    (c) Additional county expenditures to make up for the prior year's underspending may be spread
out over a two-year period."

the costs included in the approved budget, if costs are determined to be unallowable under the criteria
in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), clause (2), or if a provider's revenue is more than 105 percent of
actual allowed costs due to utilization beyond the projections in the approved budget. The repayment
to the commissioner will be proportional to the percent of total units of service reimbursed by the
commissioner.
    (d) If a provider's revenue is less than 95 percent of actual allowed costs due to lower utilization
than projected, the commissioner may adjust the rate so that the provider can recover 95 percent of
actual allowable costs. The resulting additional payment by the commissioner will be proportional
to the percent of total units of service reimbursed by the commissioner.

laws and regulations, including those referenced in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), clause (2)."

by cosigning individual treatment plans and making entries in the client's record on supervisory
activities. Clinical supervision does not include the authority to make or terminate court-ordered
placements of the child. A clinical supervisor must be available for urgent consultation as required
by the individual client's needs or the situation. Clinical supervision may occur individually or in a
small group to discuss treatment and review progress toward goals. The focus of clinical supervision
must be the client's treatment needs and progress and the mental health practitioner's or behavioral
aide's ability to provide services;

presence of the mental health professional must be documented in the child's record and signed by
the mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility;
     (5) providing direction to a mental health behavioral aide. For entities that employ mental health
behavioral aides, the clinical supervisor must be employed by the provider entity or other certified
children's therapeutic supports and services provider entity to ensure necessary and appropriate
oversight for the client's treatment and continuity of care. The mental health professional or mental
health practitioner giving direction must begin with the goals on the individualized treatment
plan, and instruct the mental health behavioral aide on how to construct therapeutic activities and
interventions that will lead to goal attainment. The professional or practitioner giving direction
must also instruct the mental health behavioral aide about the client's diagnosis, functional status,
and other characteristics that are likely to affect service delivery. Direction must also include
determining that the mental health behavioral aide has the skills to interact with the client and
the client's family in ways that convey personal and cultural respect and that the aide actively
solicits information relevant to treatment from the family. The aide must be able to clearly explain
the activities the aide is doing with the client and the activities' relationship to treatment goals.
Direction is more didactic than is supervision and requires the professional or practitioner providing
it to continuously evaluate the mental health behavioral aide's ability to carry out the activities of
the individualized treatment plan and the individualized behavior plan. When providing direction,
the professional or practitioner must:
   (i) review progress notes prepared by the mental health behavioral aide for accuracy and
consistency with diagnostic assessment, treatment plan, and behavior goals and the professional or
practitioner must approve and sign the progress notes;
   (ii) identify changes in treatment strategies, revise the individual behavior plan, and
communicate treatment instructions and methodologies as appropriate to ensure that treatment is
implemented correctly;
    (iii) demonstrate family-friendly behaviors that support healthy collaboration among the child,
the child's family, and providers as treatment is planned and implemented;

    (iv) ensure that the mental health behavioral aide is able to effectively communicate with the
child, the child's family, and the provider; and
  (v) record the results of any evaluation and corrective actions taken to modify the work of the
mental health behavioral aide;
   (6) providing service delivery that implements the individual treatment plan and meets the
requirements under subdivision 9; and
    (7) individual treatment plan review. The review must determine the extent to which the services
have met the goals and objectives in the previous treatment plan. The review must assess the client's
progress and ensure that services and treatment goals continue to be necessary and appropriate to
the client and the client's family or foster family. Revision of the individual treatment plan does not
require a new diagnostic assessment unless the client's mental health status has changed markedly.
The updated treatment plan must be signed by the clinical supervisor and by the client, if appropriate,
and by the client's parent or other person authorized by statute to give consent to the mental health
services for the child."
