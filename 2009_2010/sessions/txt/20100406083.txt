   Subd. 3. Certain criminal proceedings not resulting in conviction. A petition may be filed
under section 609A.03 to seal all records relating to an arrest, indictment or information, trial, or
verdict if the records are not subject to section 299C.11, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and if:
    (1) all pending actions or proceedings were resolved in favor of the petitioner. For purposes of
this chapter, a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is not a resolution in favor of the
petitioner; or
    (2) the petitioner has successfully completed the terms of a diversion program or stay of
adjudication that was agreed to by the prosecutor and has not been charged with a new crime for at
least one year since completion of the diversion program or stay of adjudication.

STAYS OF ADJUDICATION; NO PETITION REQUIRED WITH PROSECUTOR
AGREEMENT AND VICTIM NOTIFICATION.
    (a) Upon agreement of the prosecutor, the court shall seal the criminal record for a person
described in section 609A.02, subdivision 3, clause (2), without the filing of a petition unless it
determines that the interests of the public and public safety in keeping the record public outweigh
the disadvantages to the subject of the record in not sealing it.
   (b) Before agreeing to the sealing of a record under this section, the prosecutor shall make
a good-faith effort to inform any identifiable victims of the offense of the intended prosecutorial
agreement and the opportunity to object to the agreement.
   (c) Subject to paragraph (b), the prosecutor may agree to the sealing of records under this section
before or after the criminal charges are dismissed."

      The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
      Senator Limmer moved to amend S.F. No. 2790 as follows:
      Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
      "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 241.31, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishment of program. Notwithstanding any provisions of Minnesota
Statutes to the contrary, any city, county or town, or any nonprofit corporation approved by the
commissioner of corrections, or any combination thereof may establish and operate a community
corrections program for the purpose of providing housing, supervision, treatment, counseling or
other correctional services;
   (a) to persons convicted of crime in the courts of this state and placed on probation by such
courts pursuant to section 609.135;
   (b) to persons not yet convicted of a crime but under criminal accusation who voluntarily accept
such treatment;
   (c) to persons adjudicated a delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency
under chapter 260 or chapter 260B;
      (d) with the approval of the commissioner of corrections, to persons paroled under chapter 242;
and

      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 242.32, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Secure placement of juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall license several small
regional facilities providing secure capacity programming for juveniles who have been adjudicated
delinquent, have received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, or have been convicted as extended
jurisdiction juveniles and require secure placement. The programming shall be tailored to the types
of juveniles being served, including their offense history, age, gender, cultural and ethnic heritage,
mental health and chemical dependency problems, and other characteristics. Services offered shall
include but not be limited to:
      (1) intensive general educational programs, with an individual educational plan for each juvenile;
    (2) specific educational components in the management of anger and nonviolent conflict
resolution;
      (3) treatment for chemical dependency;
      (4) mental health screening, assessment, and treatment; and
   (5) programming to educate offenders about sexuality and address issues specific to victims and
perpetrators of sexual abuse.
   The facilities shall collaborate with facilities providing nonsecure residential programming and
with community-based aftercare programs.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.125, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Public safety. In determining whether the public safety is served by certifying the
matter, the court shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including the
existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines, the use of a firearm,
and the impact on any victim;
    (2) the culpability of the child in committing the alleged offense, including the level of the child's
participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any mitigating factors
recognized by the Sentencing Guidelines;
    (3) the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency;
   (4) the child's programming history, including the child's past willingness to participate
meaningfully in available programming;
   (5) the adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system; and
   (6) the dispositional options available for the child.
In considering these factors, the court shall give greater weight to the seriousness of the alleged
offense and the child's prior record of delinquency, including adjudications of delinquency and
delinquency petitions that resulted in stays of adjudication of delinquency, than to the other factors
listed in this subdivision.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.130, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Execution of adult sentence. (a) When it appears that a person convicted as an
extended jurisdiction juvenile has violated the conditions of the stayed sentence, or is alleged to
have committed a new offense, the court may, without notice, revoke the stay and probation and
direct that the offender be taken into immediate custody. The court shall notify the offender in
writing of the reasons alleged to exist for revocation of the stay of execution of the adult sentence.
If the offender challenges the reasons, the court shall hold a summary hearing on the issue at which
the offender is entitled to be heard and represented by counsel.
    (b) If a person described in paragraph (a) is taken into custody, the person may be detained
in a secure juvenile detention facility. If there is no secure juvenile detention facility or existing
acceptable detention alternative available for juveniles within the county, the child may be detained
up to 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or for up to six hours in a standard
metropolitan statistical area, in a jail, lockup, or other facility used for the confinement of adults
who have been charged with or convicted of a crime. In this instance, the person must be confined
in quarters separate from any adult confined in the facility that allow for complete sight and sound
separation for all activities during the period of the detention, and the adult facility must be approved
for the detention of juveniles by the commissioner of corrections.
   If the person is 18 years of age or older and is to be detained prior to the revocation hearing, the
person may be detained in a local adult correctional facility without the need for sight and sound
separation.

    (c) After the hearing, if the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay of execution of
sentence, the court shall treat the offender as an adult and order any of the adult sanctions authorized
by section 609.14, subdivision 3, except that no credit shall be given for time served in juvenile
facility custody prior to a summary hearing. If the offender was convicted of an offense described in
subdivision 1, clause (2), and the court finds that reasons exist to revoke the stay, the court must order
execution of the previously imposed sentence unless the court makes written findings regarding the
mitigating factors that justify continuing the stay.
    (d) Upon revocation, the offender's extended jurisdiction status is terminated and juvenile court
jurisdiction is terminated. The ongoing jurisdiction for any adult sanction, other than commitment
to the commissioner of corrections, is with the adult court.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to be
delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600
to 9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse
the court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall order a children's mental health screening and a chemical use screening
conducted when a child is found to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a
screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by
a mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer
who is trained in the use of the screening instrument. If the screening indicates a need for a mental
health assessment, the local social services agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall
have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section
245.4871. If the screening indicates a need for a chemical use assessment, the local social service
agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall have a chemical use assessment conducted, as
defined in section 254A.03, subdivision 3.
    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent or who received a stay of adjudication of delinquency, in order that
the condition of the minor be given due consideration in the disposition of the case. Any funds
received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not cancel until the end of the fiscal year
immediately following the fiscal year in which the funds were received. The funds are available for

use by the commissioner of corrections during that period and are hereby appropriated annually to
the commissioner of corrections as reimbursement of the costs of providing these services to the
juvenile courts.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.176, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Reasons for detention. (a) If the child is not released as provided in subdivision 1, the
person taking the child into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the
child and the reasons for detention.
    (b) No child may be detained in a juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility longer
than 36 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after being taken into custody for a
delinquent act as defined in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless a petition has been filed and the
judge or referee determines pursuant to section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in detention.
    (c) No child may be detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a
standard metropolitan statistical area, after being taken into custody for a delinquent act as defined
in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless:
   (1) a petition has been filed under section 260B.141; and
    (2) a judge or referee has determined under section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in
detention.
    After August 1, 1991, no child described in this paragraph may be detained in an adult jail or
municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than
six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a standard metropolitan statistical area, unless the
requirements of this paragraph have been met and, in addition, a motion to refer the child for adult
prosecution has been made under section 260B.125. Notwithstanding this paragraph, continued
detention of a child in an adult detention facility outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area
county is permissible if:
    (i) the facility in which the child is detained is located where conditions of distance to be traveled
or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours. A delay not to
exceed 48 hours may be made under this clause; or
    (ii) the facility is located where conditions of safety exist. Time for an appearance may be delayed
until 24 hours after the time that conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. "Conditions of safety"
include adverse life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel.
    The continued detention of a child under clause (i) or (ii) must be reported to the commissioner
of corrections.
    (d) If a child described in paragraph (c) is to be detained in a jail beyond 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the judge or referee, in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the commissioner of corrections, shall notify the commissioner of the place of
the detention and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall thereupon assist the court in the
relocation of the child in an appropriate juvenile secure detention facility or approved jail within
the county or elsewhere in the state, or in determining suitable alternatives. The commissioner
shall direct that a child detained in a jail be detained after eight days from and including the date of

the administrative authority of the facility. If the court refers the matter to the prosecuting authority
pursuant to section 260B.125, notice to the commissioner shall not be required.
     (e) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a children's
mental health screening conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of
human services, unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child
is currently under the care of a mental health professional. The screening shall be conducted by a
mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who
is trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention. The
results of the screening may only be presented to the court at the dispositional phase of the court
proceedings on the matter unless the parent or legal guardian consents to presentation at a different
time. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency or probation
officer, with the approval of the child's parent or legal guardian, shall have a diagnostic assessment
conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    (f) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a chemical
use screen conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services,
unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child is currently under
the care of a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. The screening shall be conducted by a mental
health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is
trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.198, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Continuance. When it is in the best interests of the child and public safety to do
so and when the child has admitted the allegations contained in the petition before the judge or
referee, or when a hearing has been held as provided for in section 260B.163 and the allegations
contained in the petition have been duly proven but, in either case, before a finding of delinquency
has been entered, the court may stay the adjudication of delinquency and continue the case for
a period not to exceed ­    90

crimes committed in other states or jurisdictions which would have been gross misdemeanors if
conviction occurred in this state.
    A person who issues a certificate pursuant to this section in good faith is not liable for damages
resulting or arising from the actions or misconduct with a firearm committed by the individual who
is the subject of the certificate.
    The prohibition in this subdivision relating to the possession of firearms other than pistols
and semiautomatic military-style assault weapons does not apply retroactively to persons who
are prohibited from possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon under this
subdivision before August 1, 1994.
   The lifetime prohibition on possessing, receiving, shipping, or transporting firearms for persons
convicted or adjudicated delinquent or received a stay of adjudication of delinquency of a crime
of violence in clause (2), applies only to offenders who are discharged from sentence or court
supervision for a crime of violence on or after August 1, 1993.
    For purposes of this section, "judicial determination" means a court proceeding pursuant to
sections 253B.07 to 253B.09 or a comparable law from another state.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 624.713, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice. (a) When a person is convicted of, or adjudicated delinquent, received a stay
of adjudication of delinquency, or convicted as an extended jurisdiction juvenile for committing, a
crime of violence as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 5, the court shall inform the defendant
that the defendant is prohibited from possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault
weapon for the remainder of the person's lifetime, and that it is a felony offense to violate this
prohibition. The failure of the court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect the
applicability of the pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon possession prohibition or
the felony penalty to that defendant.
     (b) When a person, including a person under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, is charged
with committing a crime of violence and is placed in a pretrial diversion program by the court
before disposition, the court shall inform the defendant that: (1) the defendant is prohibited from
possessing a pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon until the person has completed
the diversion program and the charge of committing a crime of violence has been dismissed; (2)
it is a gross misdemeanor offense to violate this prohibition; and (3) if the defendant violates this
condition of participation in the diversion program, the charge of committing a crime of violence
may be prosecuted. The failure of the court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect
the applicability of the pistol or semiautomatic military-style assault weapon possession prohibition
or the gross misdemeanor penalty to that defendant.
  Sec. 14. REVISOR INSTRUCTION; TABLE OF JUVENILE COLLATERAL
SANCTIONS.
   (a) The revisor of statutes shall publish a table in Minnesota Statutes that contains
cross-references to state laws that are collateral sanctions imposed on a juvenile as a result of an
adjudication of delinquency. The revisor shall create a structure that categorizes these laws in a
useful way to users.
   (b) The revisor shall include appropriate cautionary language with the table, including, at a

minimum, language that notifies users that:
   (1) the list of collateral sanctions laws is intended to be comprehensive but is not necessarily
complete;
    (2) the inclusion or exclusion of a collateral sanction is not intended to have any substantive
legal effect; and
   (3) users must consult the language of each cross-referenced law to fully understand the scope
and effect of the collateral sanction it imposes.
   (c) The revisor shall consult with legislative staff and the chairs of the senate and house
committees having jurisdiction over criminal justice to identify laws that impose collateral
sanctions on a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent.

    (i) the individual; or
    (ii) subject to paragraph (b), another individual acting at the direction of the individual if the

   (1) in the manner provided in paragraph (a) for making a refusal;
   (2) by subsequently making an anatomical gift pursuant to section 525A.05 that is inconsistent
with the refusal; or
    (3) by destroying or canceling the record evidencing the refusal, or the portion of the record used
to make the refusal, with the intent to revoke the refusal.
   (d) Except as otherwise provided in section 525A.08, paragraph (h), in the absence of an express,
contrary indication by the individual set forth in the refusal, an individual's unrevoked refusal to
make an anatomical gift of the individual's body or part bars all other persons from making an
anatomical gift of the individual's body or part.
