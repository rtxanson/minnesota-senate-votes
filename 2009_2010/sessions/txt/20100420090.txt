    Subd. 6. Folding of the state flag for presentation or display. The following procedures
constitute the proper way to fold the Minnesota State Flag for presentation or display. Fold the
flag four times lengthwise so that one section displays the three stars of the state crest and the text
"L'Etoile du Nord." Fold each side behind the displayed section at a 90-degree angle so that the
display section forms a triangle. Take the section ending with the hoist and fold it at a 90-degree
angle across the bottom of the display section and then fold the hoist back over so it is aligned
with the middle of the display section. Fold the other protruding section directly upwards so that
its edge is flush with the display section and then fold it upwards along a 45-degree angle so that
a mirror of the display section triangle is formed. Fold the mirror section in half from the point
upwards, then fold the remaining portion upwards, tucking it between the display section and the
remainder of the flag.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 1.141, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

duties imposed upon it by law. If a charter provision conflicts with a general law, the requirements
of the law prevail.

    A board member or employee of an eligible organization must not be an employee, contractor,
or board member of a charter school.
    Eligible organizations interested in being approved as a sponsor under this paragraph must
submit a proposal to the commissioner that includes the provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year
financial plan. Such authorizers shall consider and approve applications using the criteria provided
in subdivision 4 and shall not limit the applications it solicits, considers, or approves to any single
curriculum, learning program, or method.
    (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval
as an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The
application for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to
implement the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The
commissioner must approve or disapprove an application within 60 business days of the application
deadline. If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the
applicant of the deficiencies and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. Failing to address the deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer. The commissioner, in establishing
criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
   (1) capacity and infrastructure;
   (2) application criteria and process;
   (3) contracting process;
   (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
   (5) renewal criteria and processes.
    (d) The affidavit to be submitted to and evaluated by the commissioner must include at least the
following:
   (1) how chartering schools is a way for the organization to carry out its mission;

or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.

establish a board of directors composed of at least five members who are not related parties until
a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according
to the school's articles and bylaws under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must
be composed of at least five members who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the
school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents
or legal guardians of children enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members
of the school's board of directors. A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board
election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with
chapter 13D.

income, surplus, and deficit during the school's last annual accounting period; and a balance sheet
summarizing assets and liabilities on the closing date of the accounting period. A charter school also
must post on its official Web site information identifying its authorizer and indicate how to contact
that authorizer and include that same information about its authorizer in other school materials that
it makes available to the public.
    (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one
licensed teacher employed at the school or a licensed teacher providing instruction under a contact
between the charter school and a cooperative; (ii) the parent or legal guardian of a student enrolled
in the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed by the charter
school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher majority
board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the chief
administrator are ex-officio nonvoting board members. Board bylaws shall outline the process and
procedures for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may
change its governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must show that:

   (1) the expansion proposed by the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
    (2) the charter school expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating
students' improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter
120B;
   (3) the charter school is fiscally sound and has the financial capacity to implement the proposed
expansion; and
   (4) the authorizer finds that the charter school has the management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the authorizer of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the authorizer then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school may not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.
    (l) A charter school approved and operating under this section shall not merge with another
charter school without prior approval from the commissioner. The merger shall comply with
chapter 317A and section 124D.11, subdivision 9, paragraph (g). The commissioner shall review
the proposed merger submitted by the proposed surviving charter school and approve or disapprove
the merger based on the following criteria:

    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) An individual is prohibited from serving as a member of the
charter school board of directors if the individual, an immediate family member, or the individual's
partner is an owner, employee or agent of, or a contractor contracting with a for-profit ­   o­r entity, a
nonprofit entity, or an individual with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for
professional services, goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable
at the option of the commissioner or the charter school board of directors. A member of a charter
school board of directors who violates this prohibition is individually liable to the charter school for
any damage caused by the violation.
    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict

   (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3),

of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
    (e) A charter school board member must not receive any remuneration such as a fee-for-service
as part of a financial transaction involving the charter school. A charter school employee may receive
remuneration such as a fee-for-service as part of a financial transaction involving a charter school
only if the services for which the remuneration is paid are in addition to the services the employee
already agreed to provide to the charter school and the charter school board of directors formally
approve the remuneration.

of the organization proposing to lease a building or land to the charter school is to provide a facility
for the charter school, and (1) the organization has financed the acquisition of the school facility
through rent paid by the charter school from building lease aid under section 124D.11, subdivision
4; or (2) the organization is maintaining the school facility on behalf of the charter school through

    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), with the approval of the commissioner of education, a charter
school that is approved to receive building lease aid under section 124D.11, subdivision 4, may
lease space from a corporation or organization whose owner, board members, employees, or related
parties are not board members or employees or related to board members or employees of the
charter school, and the corporation or organization is not otherwise directly or indirectly controlled
by board members, employees, or related parties of the charter school leasing the facility. If the

purpose of purchasing a building using building lease aid, the commissioner must deny the lease.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a charter school that is approved to receive building lease
transition aid under section 124D.11, subdivision 4d, may lease space from an independent or
special school district eligible to be an authorizer or other public organization, private, nonprofit

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2011 and later.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating
a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed
action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and
that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the
authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract.
Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 15-business-day
period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written
request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to the charter school's board
of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal hearing before taking
final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract no later than 20
business days before the proposed date for terminating the contract or the end date of the contract.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;

    (3) violations of law; or
    (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 3

    (c) If the sponsor and the charter school board of directors mutually agree to terminate or not
renew the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves the transfer
to a different eligible authorizer to authorize the charter school. Both parties must jointly submit
their intent in writing to the commissioner to mutually terminate the contract. The sponsor that is
a party to the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about
the fiscal and operational status and student performance of the school. Before the commissioner
determines whether to approve a transfer of authorizer, the commissioner first must determine
whether the charter school and prospective new authorizer can identify and effectively resolve
those circumstances causing the previous authorizer and the charter school to mutually agree to
terminate the contract. If no transfer of sponsor is approved, the school must be dissolved according
to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
    (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing, may
terminate the existing contract between the authorizer and the charter school board if the charter
school has a history of:
    (1) failure to meet pupil performance requirements contained in the contract;
  (2) financial mismanagement or failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal
management; or
    (3) repeated or major violations of the law.
    (e) If the commissioner terminates a charter school contract under subdivision 3, paragraph (g),
the commissioner shall provide the charter school with information about other eligible authorizers.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 9. [124D.101] VACANT BUILDING INVENTORY.
    The commissioner of administration, in conjunction with the commissioner of education, shall
annually publish a list of vacant and unused buildings and vacant and unused portions of buildings
that are owned by the state or by school districts in the state and that may be suitable for the
long-term operation of a charter school. The commissioner of education shall make the list available
to applicants for charter schools and to existing charter schools. The list shall include the address
of each building, a short description of the building, and the name of the owner of the building.
Nothing in this section requires the owner of a building on the list to sell or lease the building or a
portion of the building to a charter school or to any other school or to any other prospective buyer
or tenant. The commissioner of education may request information from school districts to compile

to the product of the formula allowance according to section 126C.10, subdivision 2, times .0485,
calculated without basic skills revenue, extended time revenue, alternative teacher compensation
revenue, transition revenue, and transportation sparsity revenue, plus basic skills revenue, extended
time revenue, basic alternative teacher compensation aid according to section 126C.10, subdivision
34, and transition revenue as though the school were a school district. The general education
revenue for each extended time marginal cost pupil unit equals $4,378.
   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), for charter schools in the first year of operation, general
education revenue shall be computed using the number of adjusted pupil units in the current fiscal
year.

    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), general education revenue for a charter school receiving
facilities aid under subdivision 4a must be reduced by an amount equal to the greater of zero or the
difference between the school's facilities aid and the product of the pupil units served times:
   (1) for a school receiving building lease aid for fiscal year 2010, the lesser of $1,120 or the

to the commissioner for building lease aid for this purpose. The commissioner must review and
either approve or deny a lease aid application using the following criteria:

the organization has financed the acquisition of the school facility through rent paid by the charter
school from building lease aid under this subdivision; or (2) the organization is maintaining the
school facility on behalf of the charter school through rent paid by the charter school's lease aid
under this subdivision, the commissioner must deny the charter school's lease aid application under
this subdivision.

approve or deny a building lease transition aid application using the following criteria:
    (1) the reasonableness of the price based on current market values;
    (2) the extent to which the lease conforms to applicable state laws and rules; and

circumstances of the charter school.
    (b) For fiscal year 2011 and in later years, for the first year a lease is initiated or modified, to retain
eligibility for building lease transition aid, an eligible charter school must submit the following

facility will transfer to the charter school upon the maturity of the bonds or debt instruments used
to finance the school facility.
    (c) For fiscal year 2012 and later, for leases approved for building lease aid in the prior fiscal
year and not modified for the current fiscal year, any other information the commissioner requests

A charter school that receives building lease aid for an education site under subdivision 4, or charter
school facilities aid for an education site under subdivision 4a, is not eligible for building lease
transition aid for the same site under this subdivision. A charter school that received more than
$1,200 per pupil unit in lease aid under subdivision 4 for fiscal year 2010 must continue to receive
that per pupil unit aid amount for education sites eligible for building lease transition aid until that
charter school receives facilities aid under subdivision 4a.

3, aid payments for the current fiscal year to a charter school shall be of an equal amount on each
of the 24 payment dates.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and section 127A.45, for a charter school ceasing operation

After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an audit of pupil counts, documentation
of lease expenditures, and monitoring of special education expenditures, the commissioner may
release cash withheld and may continue regular payments up to the current year payment percentages
if further amounts are owed. If, based on audits and monitoring, the school received state aid in
excess of the amount owed, the commissioner shall retain aid withheld sufficient to eliminate the
aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations prior to, or at the end of, a school year,
notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary final payments may be made after
receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of special education expenditures,
documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of Uniform Financial Accounting and
Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year of operation. Final payment may be
made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section 123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount
of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If, within the timeline under section 471.425, a charter school fails to pay the state of
Minnesota, a school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative after receiving an
undisputed invoice for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid
sufficient to satisfy the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative. An interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or education cooperative shall notify the commissioner
when a charter school fails to pay an undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it
received the original invoice.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.
    (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the
department and a quarterly report to the Department of Education. The report must list each student
by grade, show the student's start and end dates, if any, with the charter school, and for any student
participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar
quarter to the department. The department must develop a Web-based reporting form for charter
schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in
the form and manner requested by the department.

paragraph (l), a charter school may first sell at appraised market value or transfer its assets to a
school district or a charter school.

cost of the acquisition, acquisition and renovation, or construction of a charter school building.
The authority may enter into a loan agreement with an endorsed charter school so that payments
required to be made by the endorsed charter school are fixed and revised as necessary to produce
income and revenue sufficient to provide for the prompt payment of principal or interest on all
bonds issued when due. The loan agreement must also provide that the endorsed charter school
is required to pay all expenses of the operation and maintenance of the charter school building,
including adequate insurance and insurance against all liability for injury to persons or property
arising from its operation, and all taxes and special assessments levied upon or with respect to the
charter school building and payable during the term of the loan agreement.

interest accrued or to accrue to the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds. The
proceeds of the refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the authority, be applied to the purchases
or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or the redemption of the outstanding bonds on
the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and may, until so used, be placed in
escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption. Refunding bonds issued under this
subdivision must be issued and secured in the manner provided by the authority.

of money of the state or the authority for the payment of the bonds, except as specifically provided

reduced or repealed at any time. Any bonds issued must contain a conspicuous statement to that

is made. The money or property pledged and later received by the authority is immediately subject
to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the property or money or further act, and
the lien of any pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort,
contract, or otherwise against the authority, whether or not those parties have notice of the lien or
pledge. Neither the order nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.
    Subd. 7. Bonds; purchase and cancellation. The authority, subject to agreements with
bondholders that may then exist, may, out of any money available for the purpose, purchase bonds
of the authority at a price not exceeding (1) if the bonds are then redeemable, the redemption price
then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment date thereon, or (2) if the bonds
are not redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after the purchase upon which
the bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to that date.

the holders until the bonds, together with interest on them, with interest on any unpaid installments
of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of
the bondholders, are fully met and discharged. The authority may include this pledge and agreement
of the state in any agreement with the holders of bonds issued under this section.

the term "debt obligation" means bonds issued by the Charter School Facilities Authority under
section 124D.1108.
    Subd. 2. Notifications; payment; appropriation. (a) If an endorsed charter school believes that
it may be unable to pay the amount sufficient to permit the Charter School Facilities Authority to
make a principal or interest payment on an outstanding debt obligation on the date that payment is
due, it must notify the commissioner of education as soon as possible, but not less than 15 business
days before the date that principal or interest payment is due. The notice must include the name
of the endorsed charter school, an identification of the debt obligation issue in question, the date
the payment is due, the amount of principal or interest due on the payment date, the amount of
principal or interest that the endorsed charter school will be unable to repay on that date, the trustee
or paying agent for the debt obligation, the wire transfer instructions to transfer funds to that trustee
or paying agent, and an indication whether a payment is being requested by the endorsed charter
school under this section. If a trustee or paying agent becomes aware of a potential default, it shall
immediately inform the commissioner of education of that fact. After receipt of a notice that requests
a payment under this section, after consultation with the endorsed charter school and the trustee or
paying agent, and after verification of the accuracy of the information provided, the commissioner
of education shall notify the commissioner of management and budget of the potential default. The
notice must include a statement of the amount due that the endorsed charter school will be unable
to repay on the date due.
   (b) Except as provided in subdivision 6, upon receipt of this notice from the commissioner of
education, the commissioner of management and budget shall issue a warrant and authorize the
commissioner of education to pay to the trustee or paying agent for the debt obligation the specified
amount on or before the date due. The amounts needed for the purposes of this subdivision are
annually appropriated to the commissioner of education from the charter school credit enhancement
account in the special revenue fund in the state treasury.
    (c) The commissioners of education and management and budget must jointly develop detailed
procedures for endorsed charter schools to notify the state that they have obligated themselves to
be bound by the provisions of this section, procedures for endorsed charter schools and trustees and
paying agents to notify the state of potential defaults and to request state payment under this section,
and procedures for the state to expedite payments to prevent defaults. The procedures are not subject
to chapter 14.
    Subd. 3. Endorsed charter school bound; interest rate on state-paid amount. If, at the request
of an endorsed charter school, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on an
endorsed charter school's debt obligation on a specific date, the endorsed charter school is bound by
all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the date paid until
the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner of management
and budget. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding, less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4, and other payments received from the endorsed charter school.
    Subd. 4. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the
commissioner must reduce the state aid payable to the endorsed charter school under section
124D.11 by the amount paid by the commissioner under this section on behalf of the endorsed
charter school, plus the interest due on it, and the commissioner of management and budget shall
transfer the amount reduced from the appropriate account to the charter school facilities credit

enhancement account. No federal aid payments shall be reduced.
    (b) If, after review of the financial situation of the endorsed charter school, the commissioner
of education advises the commissioner of management and budget that a total reduction of aids
would cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the
endorsed charter school, the commissioner of education, with the approval of the commissioner of
management and budget, may establish a different schedule for reduction of aids to repay the state.
The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any amounts repaid to the state by the endorsed
charter school from other revenue sources.
    Subd. 5. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the commissioner makes payments on
behalf of an endorsed charter school under this section or the endorsed charter school defaults in
the payment of principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to
the commissioner of education for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to
resolve the issues that led to its inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The
commissioners must provide technical assistance to the endorsed charter school in preparing its
plan.
    Subd. 6. State bond rating. If the commissioner of management and budget determines that
issuing warrants under subdivision 2 would adversely affect the credit rating of the state, the
commissioner of management and budget shall not issue warrants for the payment of principal or
interest on debt obligations under this section.
    Subd. 7. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of management and budget
may enter into written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information
with respect to bonds issued to finance the school facilities of endorsed charter schools according
to federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, including Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and regulations, section 240.15c2-12. The agreements or contracts may be in any form the
