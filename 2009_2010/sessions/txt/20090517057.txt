The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
Please be advised that I have received, approved, signed and deposited in the Office of the Secretary
of State, Chapter 95, S.F. No. 2083, with the exception of the following line-item vetoes:
5894                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [57TH DAY

Page 4, Lines 4.18-4.20: $250,000 each year in 2010 and 2011. This appropriation provides tuition
scholarships to early childhood care and education providers. It is a worthy program, but since the
program already receives $250,000 each year through the Department of Human Services in Laws
of Minnesota, 2009, Chapter 79, Article 13, Sec. 11, Subd. 4(c), this appropriation was vetoed due
to Minnesota's budget challenges.
Page 5, Lines 5.29-5.33: The Power of You Program, $1 million each year in 2010 and 2011. The
program functioned with only privately donated funds until 2008. The program received $600,000
in one-time state funding in FY 2009. Expanding this program, which will serve only six Minnesota
cities, is unfortunately not a viable option as Minnesota faces the largest budget deficit in state
history.
Page 11, lines 11.3-11.6: Cook County Higher Education Board, $40,000 each year in 2010 and
2011. A county board is not the appropriate place to fund higher education. In addition, this
program could be served with funds from the dedicated taconite tax revenue in the Iron Range
Higher Education District.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that the item veto message of S.F. No. 2083 be laid on the table. The
motion prevailed.

                                                                                       May 16, 2009
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 284, Chapter 99, a bill applying certain privileges to
major political party caucuses held in cities of the first class during odd-numbered years.
This would allow for special privileges for caucus attendees who reside in Saint Paul, Minneapolis,
and Duluth. The state should not dictate additional mandates on businesses for what is a local issue.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 284 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                       May 16, 2009
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 2141, Chapter 100, a bill for continuing appropriations
for state agencies. This "lights on" bill overlaps with appropriations found in omnibus appropriations

                                                      Sincerely,

   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.04, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Commissioner's right of access. When the commissioner is exercising the powers
conferred by this chapter and ­   s­ t­o

                                         n sections 245.69, 626.556, and 626.557, the commissioner
must be given access to the physical plant and grounds where the program is provided, documents
and records, including records maintained in electronic format, persons served by the program,
and staff whenever the program is in operation and the information is relevant to inspections or
investigations conducted by the commissioner. The commissioner must be given access without
prior notice and as often as the commissioner considers necessary if the commissioner is conducting
an investigation of allegations of maltreatment or other violation of applicable laws or rules. In
conducting inspections, the commissioner may request and shall receive assistance from other state,
county, and municipal governmental agencies and departments. The applicant or license holder shall
allow the commissioner to photocopy, photograph, and make audio and video tape recordings during

photocopying hospital medical records.
   Persons served by the program have the right to refuse to consent to be interviewed,
photographed, or audio or videotaped. Failure or refusal of an applicant or license holder to fully
comply with this subdivision is reasonable cause for the commissioner to deny the application or
immediately suspend or revoke the license.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.04, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Grant of license; license extension. (a) If the commissioner determines that the

   (1) the name of the license holder;
   (2) the address of the program;
   (3) the effective date and expiration date of the license;
   (4) the type of license;
   (5) the maximum number and ages of persons that may receive services from the program; and
   (6) any special conditions of licensure.
   (b) The commissioner may issue an initial license for a period not to exceed two years if:
57TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                       5931

    (1) the commissioner is unable to conduct the evaluation or observation required by subdivision
4, paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), because the program is not yet operational;
   (2) certain records and documents are not available because persons are not yet receiving services
from the program; and
   (3) the applicant complies with applicable laws and rules in all other respects.
   (c) A decision by the commissioner to issue a license does not guarantee that any person or
persons will be placed or cared for in the licensed program. A license shall not be transferable
to another individual, corporation, partnership, voluntary association, other organization, or
controlling individual or to another location.
  (d) A license holder must notify the commissioner and obtain the commissioner's approval before
making any changes that would alter the license information listed under paragraph (a).
   (e) The commissioner shall not issue or reissue a license if the applicant, license holder, or
controlling individual has:
   (1) been disqualified and the disqualification was not set aside and no variance has been granted;
   (2) has been denied a license within the past two years; o
                                                            ­­r
   (3) had a license revoked within the past five years; or
   (4) has an outstanding debt related to a license fee, licensing fine, or settlement agreement for
which payment is delinquent.
   When a license is revoked under clause (1) or (3), the license holder and controlling individual
may not hold any license under chapter 245A or 245B for five years following the revocation, and
other licenses held by the applicant, license holder, or controlling individual shall also be revoked.
    (f) The commissioner shall not issue a license if an individual living in the household where
the licensed services will be provided as specified under section 245C.03, subdivision 1, has been
disqualified and the disqualification has not been set aside and no variance has been granted.
    (g) For purposes of reimbursement for meals only, under the Child and Adult Care Food
Program, Code of Federal Regulations, title 7, subtitle B, chapter II, subchapter A, part 226,
relocation within the same county by a licensed family day care provider, shall be considered an
extension of the license for a period of no more than 30 calendar days or until the new license is
issued, whichever occurs first, provided the county agency has determined the family day care
provider meets licensure requirements at the new location.
    (h) Unless otherwise specified by statute, all licenses expire at 12:01 a.m. on the day after the
expiration date stated on the license. A license holder must apply for and be granted a new license
to operate the program or the program must not be operated after the expiration date.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.05, is amended to read:

appeal the denial by notifying the commissioner in writing by certified mail or personal service

must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within 20 calendar days after the applicant
received the notice of denial. If an appeal request is made by personal service, it must be received
by the commissioner within 20 calendar days after the applicant received the notice of denial.
Section 245A.08 applies to hearings held to appeal the commissioner's denial of an application.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.07, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Sanctions; appeals; license. (a) In addition to making a license conditional under
section 245A.06, the commissioner may p     ­­

secure an injunction against the continuing operation of the program of a license holder who does
not comply with applicable law or rule. When applying sanctions authorized under this section, the
commissioner shall consider the nature, chronicity, or severity of the violation of law or rule and
the effect of the violation on the health, safety, or rights of persons served by the program.
    (b) If a license holder appeals the suspension or revocation of a license and the license holder
continues to operate the program pending a final order on the appeal, and the license expires during
this time period, the commissioner shall issue the license holder a temporary provisional license.
The temporary provisional license is effective on the date issued and expires on the date that a final
order is issued. Unless otherwise specified by the commissioner, variances in effect on the date
of the license sanction under appeal continue under the temporary provisional license. If a license
holder fails to comply with applicable law or rule while operating under a temporary provisional
license, the commissioner may impose sanctions under this section and section 245A.06, and may
terminate any prior variance. If the license holder prevails on the appeal and the effective period of
the previous license has expired, a new license shall be issued to the license holder upon payment
of any fee required under section 245A.10. The effective date of the new license shall be retroactive
to the date the license would have shown had no sanction been initiated. The expiration date shall
be the expiration date of that license had no license sanction been initiated.

    (c) If a license holder is under investigation and the license is due to expire before completion
of the investigation, the program shall be issued a new license upon completion of the reapplication
requirements. Upon completion of the investigation, a licensing sanction may be imposed against
the new license under this section, section 245A.06, or 245A.08.
    (d) Failure to reapply or closure of a license by the license holder prior to the completion of
any investigation shall not preclude the commissioner from issuing a licensing sanction under this
section, section 245A.06, or 245A.08 at the conclusion of the investigation.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. License suspension, revocation, or fine. (a) The commissioner may suspend or revoke
a license, or impose a fine if a license holder fails to comply fully with applicable laws or rules, if a
license holder, a controlling individual, or an individual living in the household where the licensed
services are provided or is otherwise subject to a background study has a disqualification which
has not been set aside under section 245C.22, or if a license holder knowingly withholds relevant
information from or gives false or misleading information to the commissioner in connection with
an application for a license, in connection with the background study status of an individual, during
an investigation, or regarding compliance with applicable laws or rules. A license holder who has
had a license suspended, revoked, or has been ordered to pay a fine must be given notice of the action
by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address shown on
the application or the last known address of the license holder. The notice must state the reasons the
license was suspended, revoked, or a fine was ordered.
     (b) If the license was suspended or revoked, the notice must inform the license holder of the right
to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612.
The license holder may appeal an order suspending or revoking a license. The appeal of an order
suspending or revoking a license must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If
mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder receives notice that the license has been suspended or revoked. If a request is
made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder received the order. Except as provided in subdivision 2a, paragraph (c), if a license
holder submits a timely appeal of an order suspending or revoking a license ­  h­

    (c)(1) If the license holder was ordered to pay a fine, the notice must inform the license holder of
the responsibility for payment of fines and the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and
Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The appeal of an order to pay a fine must be made
in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent
to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder receives notice that the fine
has been ordered. If a request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner
within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order.
    (2) The license holder shall pay the fines assessed on or before the payment date specified. If
the license holder fails to fully comply with the order, the commissioner may issue a second fine
or suspend the license until the license holder complies. If the license holder receives state funds,
the state, county, or municipal agencies or departments responsible for administering the funds shall
withhold payments and recover any payments made while the license is suspended for failure to pay

a fine. A timely appeal shall stay payment of the fine until the commissioner issues a final order.
    (3) A license holder shall promptly notify the commissioner of human services, in writing, when
a violation specified in the order to forfeit a fine is corrected. If upon reinspection the commissioner
determines that a violation has not been corrected as indicated by the order to forfeit a fine, the
commissioner may issue a second fine. The commissioner shall notify the license holder by certified
mail or personal service that a second fine has been assessed. The license holder may appeal the
second fine as provided under this subdivision.
    (4) Fines shall be assessed as follows: the license holder shall forfeit $1,000 for each
determination of maltreatment of a child under section 626.556 or the maltreatment of a vulnerable
adult under section 626.557 for which the license holder is determined responsible for the
maltreatment under section 626.556, subdivision 10e, paragraph (i), or 626.557, subdivision 9c,
paragraph (c); the license holder shall forfeit $200 for each occurrence of a violation of law or
rule governing matters of health, safety, or supervision, including but not limited to the provision
of adequate staff-to-child or adult ratios, and failure to ­ub
                                                           s­     ­

requirements under chapter 245C; and the license holder shall forfeit $100 for each occurrence of
a violation of law or rule other than those subject to a $1,000 or $200 fine above. For purposes of
this section, "occurrence" means each violation identified in the commissioner's fine order. Fines
assessed against a license holder that holds a license to provide the residential-based habilitation
services, as defined under section 245B.02, subdivision 20, and a license to provide foster care,
may be assessed against both licenses for the same occurrence, but the combined amount of the
fines shall not exceed the amount specified in this clause for that occurrence.
    (5) When a fine has been assessed, the license holder may not avoid payment by closing, selling,
or otherwise transferring the licensed program to a third party. In such an event, the license holder
will be personally liable for payment. In the case of a corporation, each controlling individual is
personally and jointly liable for payment.

a fitted crib sheet that fits tightly on the mattress and overlaps the mattress so it cannot be
dislodged by pulling on the corner of the sheet. The license holder must not place pillows, quilts,
comforters, sheepskin, pillow-like stuffed toys, or other soft products in the crib with the infant. The
requirements of this section apply to license holders serving infants up to and including 12 months

serious or recurring maltreatment; and
   (6) the required presence of a caregiver in the adult foster care residence during normal sleeping

14 children.
    (b) County agencies must report information about disqualification reconsiderations under
sections 245C.25 and 245C.27, subdivision 2, paragraphs (a) and (b), and variances granted under
paragraph (a), clause (5), to the commissioner at least monthly in a format prescribed by the
commissioner.
   (c) For family day care programs, the commissioner may authorize licensing reviews every two
years after a licensee has had at least one annual review.
   (d) For family adult day services programs, the commissioner may authorize licensing reviews
every two years after a licensee has had at least one annual review.
   (e) A license issued under this section may be issued for up to two years.

a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, and whose disqualification was
set aside prior to July 1, 2005, the commissioner must consider granting a variance pursuant to

services from the provider for over six months, and the adopted individual is required to receive

each of the remaining individuals in placement in the home and the licensing agency for the home.

  245C.25 CONSOLIDATED    RECONSIDERATION                              OF      MALTREATMENT
DETERMINATION AND DISQUALIFICATION.
    (a) If an individual is disqualified on the basis of a determination of maltreatment under section
626.556 or 626.557, which was serious or recurring, and the individual requests reconsideration of
the maltreatment determination under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, or 626.557, subdivision 9d,
and also requests reconsideration of the disqualification under section 245C.21, the commissioner
shall consolidate the reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification into
a single reconsideration.
    (b) For maltreatment and disqualification determinations made by county agencies, the county
agency shall conduct the consolidated reconsideration. If the county agency has disqualified an
individual on multiple bases, one of which is a county maltreatment determination for which the
individual has a right to request reconsideration, the county shall conduct the reconsideration of all
disqualifications.
    (c) If the county has previously conducted a consolidated reconsideration under paragraph
(b) of a maltreatment determination and a disqualification based on serious or recurring
maltreatment, and the county subsequently disqualifies the individual based on that determination,
the county shall conduct the reconsideration of the subsequent disqualification. The scope of the
subsequent disqualification shall be limited to whether the individual poses a risk of harm in
accordance with section 245C.22, subdivision 4. If the commissioner subsequently disqualifies
the individual in connection with a child foster care license based on the county's previous
maltreatment determination, the commissioner shall conduct the reconsideration of the subsequent
disqualification.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 245C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Fair hearing when disqualification is not set aside. (a) If the commissioner
does not set aside a disqualification of an individual under section 245C.22 who is disqualified on
the basis of a preponderance of evidence that the individual committed an act or acts that meet the
definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; for a determination under section 626.556
or 626.557 of substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring under section 245C.15; or
for failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3; or 626.557, subdivision
3, pursuant to section 245C.15, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (1), the individual may request
a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the disqualification is deemed conclusive under section
245C.29.
    (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the
right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction ­o­
             r of, admission to, or Alford Plea to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions
1 to 4, or for a disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision
under section 245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified
individual and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified
based on a judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for
57TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                       5951

purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if the commissioner does not set aside a disqualification of
an individual who was disqualified based on both a preponderance of evidence and a conviction
or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the
disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the hearing conducted
under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.045, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. State agency hearings. (a) State agency hearings are available for the following:
    (1) any person applying for, receiving or having received public assistance, medical care, or
a program of social services granted by the state agency or a county agency or the federal Food
Stamp Act whose application for assistance is denied, not acted upon with reasonable promptness,
or whose assistance is suspended, reduced, terminated, or claimed to have been incorrectly paid;
   (2) any patient or relative aggrieved by an order of the commissioner under section 252.27;
   (3) a party aggrieved by a ruling of a prepaid health plan;
    (4) except as provided under chapter 245C, any individual or facility determined by a lead agency
to have maltreated a vulnerable adult under section 626.557 after they have exercised their right to
administrative reconsideration under section 626.557;
    (5) any person whose claim for foster care payment according to a placement of the child
resulting from a child protection assessment under section 626.556 is denied or not acted upon
with reasonable promptness, regardless of funding source;
    (6) any person to whom a right of appeal according to this section is given by other provision
of law;
    (7) an applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision to an application for a hardship waiver under
section 256B.15;
  (8) an applicant aggrieved by an adverse decision to an application or redetermination for a
Medicare Part D prescription drug subsidy under section 256B.04, subdivision 4a;
   (9) except as provided under chapter 245A, an individual or facility determined to have
maltreated a minor under section 626.556, after the individual or facility has exercised the right to
administrative reconsideration under section 626.556; or
   (10) except as provided under chapter 245C, an individual disqualified under sections 245C.14
and 245C.15, which has not been set aside under sections 245C.22 and 245C.23, on the basis
of serious or recurring maltreatment; a preponderance of the evidence that the individual has
committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15,

subdivisions 1 to 4; or for failing to make reports required under section 626.556, subdivision
3, or 626.557, subdivision 3. Hearings regarding a maltreatment determination under clause (4)
or (9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for a disqualification is serious
or recurring maltreatment, which has not been set aside under sections 245C.22 and 245C.23,
shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of review by the human
services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the disqualification. The
failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be a bar to a hearing
under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to dispute a finding
of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest the specified
action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written request for a
hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action, decision,
or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient, patient, or
relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time limit.
     (b) The hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause (4), (9), or (10), is the
only administrative appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to
the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under paragraph
(a), clause (4), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995.
Hearings requested by nursing assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident
prior to October 1, 1995, shall be held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter
14. Hearings requested under paragraph (a), clause (9), apply only to incidents of maltreatment that
occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing for an individual or facility under paragraph (a), clause
(9), is only available when there is no juvenile court or adult criminal action pending. If such action
is filed in either court while an administrative review is pending, the administrative review must be
suspended until the judicial actions are completed. If the juvenile court action or criminal charge
is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the matter may be considered in an administrative
hearing.
   (c) For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
    (d) The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under paragraph (a), clause
(5), shall be limited to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement
under court order or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care
payment to be made on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's
child protection determination or child placement decision.
   (e) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.
   (f) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (g) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256.045, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3b. Standard of evidence for maltreatment and disqualification hearings. (a) The
57TH DAY]                             SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                         5953

state human services referee shall determine that maltreatment has occurred if a preponderance of
evidence exists to support the final disposition under sections 626.556 and 626.557. For purposes
of hearings regarding disqualification, the state human services referee shall affirm the proposed
disqualification in an appeal under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (9), if a preponderance of
the evidence shows the individual has:
   (1) committed maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557, which is serious or recurring;
   (2) committed an act or acts meeting the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15,
subdivisions 1 to 4; or
    (3) failed to make required reports under section 626.556 or 626.557, for incidents in which the
final disposition under section 626.556 or 626.557 was substantiated maltreatment that was serious
or recurring.
    (b) If the disqualification is affirmed, the state human services referee shall determine whether
the individual poses a risk of harm in accordance with the requirements of section ­           2­­C
                                                                                                45 ­­1
                                                                                                    .­ 6
                                                                                                       ­
245C.22, and whether the disqualification should be set aside or not set aside. In determining
whether the disqualification should be set aside, the human services referee shall consider all of the
characteristics that cause the individual to be disqualified, including those characteristics that were
not subject to review under paragraph (a), in order to determine whether the individual poses a risk
of harm. A decision to set aside a disqualification that is the subject of the hearing constitutes a
determination that the individual does not pose a risk of harm and that the individual may provide
direct contact services in the individual program specified in the set aside. If a determination that
the information relied upon to disqualify an individual was correct and is conclusive under section
245C.29, and the individual is subsequently disqualified under section 245C.14, the individual has
a right to again request reconsideration on the risk of harm under section 245C.21. Subsequent
determinations regarding risk of harm are not subject to another hearing under this section.
    (c) The state human services referee shall recommend an order to the commissioner of health,
education, or human services, as applicable, who shall issue a final order. The commissioner shall
affirm, reverse, or modify the final disposition. Any order of the commissioner issued in accordance
with this subdivision is conclusive upon the parties unless appeal is taken in the manner provided in
subdivision 7. In any licensing appeal under chapters 245A and 245C and sections 144.50 to 144.58
and 144A.02 to 144A.46, the commissioner's determination as to maltreatment is conclusive, as
provided under section 245C.29.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Provider entity certification. (a) Effective July 1, 2003, the commissioner shall
establish an initial provider entity application and certification process and recertification process
to determine whether a provider entity has an administrative and clinical infrastructure that meets
the requirements in subdivisions 5 and 6. The commissioner shall recertify a provider entity at least
every three years. The commissioner shall establish a process for decertification of a provider entity
that no longer meets the requirements in this section. The county, tribe, and the commissioner shall
be mutually responsible and accountable for the county's, tribe's, and state's part of the certification,
recertification, and decertification processes.
   (b) For purposes of this section, a provider entity must be:

    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Provider entity clinical infrastructure requirements. (a) To be an eligible provider
entity under this section, a provider entity must have a clinical infrastructure that utilizes diagnostic
assessment, an individualized treatment plan, service delivery, and individual treatment plan review
that are culturally competent, child-centered, and family-driven to achieve maximum benefit for the
client. The provider entity must review, and update as necessary, the clinical policies and procedures
every three years and must distribute the policies and procedures to staff initially and upon each
subsequent update.
   (b) The clinical infrastructure written policies and procedures must include policies and
procedures for:
    (1) providing or obtaining a client's diagnostic assessment that identifies acute and chronic
clinical disorders, co-occurring medical conditions, sources of psychological and environmental
problems, ­ an
             ­d­ including a functional assessment. The functional assessment component must
clearly summarize the client's individual strengths and needs;
    (2) developing an individual treatment plan that is:
    (i) based on the information in the client's diagnostic assessment;
    (ii) developed no later than the end of the first psychotherapy session after the completion
of the client's diagnostic assessment by the mental health professional who provides the client's
psychotherapy;
    (iii) developed through a child-centered, family-driven planning process that identifies service
needs and individualized, planned, and culturally appropriate interventions that contain specific
treatment goals and objectives for the client and the client's family or foster family;
    (iv) reviewed at least once every 90 days and revised, if necessary; and
    (v) signed by the client or, if appropriate, by the client's parent or other person authorized by
statute to consent to mental health services for the client;
   (3) developing an individual behavior plan that documents services to be provided by the mental
health behavioral aide. The individual behavior plan must include:
    (i) detailed instructions on the service to be provided;
    (ii) time allocated to each service;
    (iii) methods of documenting the child's behavior;
    (iv) methods of monitoring the child's progress in reaching objectives; and
57TH DAY]                                          SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                                               5955

     (v) goals to increase or decrease targeted behavior as identified in the individual treatment plan;
    (4) clinical supervision of the mental health practitioner and mental health behavioral aide.
A mental health professional must document the clinical supervision the professional provides
by cosigning individual treatment plans and making entries in the client's record on supervisory
activities. Clinical supervision does not include the authority to make or terminate court-ordered
placements of the child. A clinical supervisor must be available for urgent consultation as required
by the individual client's needs or the situation. Clinical supervision may occur individually or
in a small group to discuss treatment and review progress toward goals. The focus of clinical
supervision must be the client's treatment needs and progress and the mental health practitioner's
or behavioral aide's ability to provide services;
    (4a) CTSS certified provider entities providing day treatment programs must meet the conditions
in items (i) to (iii):
    (i) the supervisor must be present and available on the premises more than 50 percent of the time
in a five-working-day period during which the supervisee is providing a mental health service;
    (ii) the diagnosis and the client's individual treatment plan or a change in the diagnosis or
individual treatment plan must be made by or reviewed, approved, and signed by the supervisor;
and
   (iii) every 30 days, the supervisor must review and sign the record ­  o­
                                                                           f indicating the supervisor
has reviewed the client's care for all activities in the preceding 30-day period;
     (4b) for all other services provided under CTSS, clinical supervision standards provided in items
(i) to (iii) must be used:
     (i) medical assistance shall reimburse a mental health practitioner who maintains a consulting
relationship with a mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility ­                                         a­

                   , the mental health professional is required to be present on site for observation as
clinically appropriate when the mental health practitioner is providing individual, family, or group
skills training to the child or the child's family; and
    (iii) when conducted, the observation must be a minimum of one clinical unit. The on-site
presence of the mental health professional must be documented in the child's record and signed by
the mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility;
    (5) providing direction to a mental health behavioral aide. For entities that employ mental health
behavioral aides, the clinical supervisor must be employed by the provider entity or other certified
children's therapeutic supports and services provider entity to ensure necessary and appropriate
oversight for the client's treatment and continuity of care. The mental health professional or mental
health practitioner giving direction must begin with the goals on the individualized treatment
plan, and instruct the mental health behavioral aide on how to construct therapeutic activities and
interventions that will lead to goal attainment. The professional or practitioner giving direction
must also instruct the mental health behavioral aide about the client's diagnosis, functional status,
and other characteristics that are likely to affect service delivery. Direction must also include
determining that the mental health behavioral aide has the skills to interact with the client and

the client's family in ways that convey personal and cultural respect and that the aide actively
solicits information relevant to treatment from the family. The aide must be able to clearly explain
the activities the aide is doing with the client and the activities' relationship to treatment goals.
Direction is more didactic than is supervision and requires the professional or practitioner providing
it to continuously evaluate the mental health behavioral aide's ability to carry out the activities of
the individualized treatment plan and the individualized behavior plan. When providing direction,
the professional or practitioner must:
   (i) review progress notes prepared by the mental health behavioral aide for accuracy and
consistency with diagnostic assessment, treatment plan, and behavior goals and the professional or
practitioner must approve and sign the progress notes;
   (ii) identify changes in treatment strategies, revise the individual behavior plan, and
communicate treatment instructions and methodologies as appropriate to ensure that treatment is
implemented correctly;
    (iii) demonstrate family-friendly behaviors that support healthy collaboration among the child,
the child's family, and providers as treatment is planned and implemented;
    (iv) ensure that the mental health behavioral aide is able to effectively communicate with the
child, the child's family, and the provider; and
  (v) record the results of any evaluation and corrective actions taken to modify the work of the
mental health behavioral aide;
   (6) providing service delivery that implements the individual treatment plan and meets the
requirements under subdivision 9; and
    (7) individual treatment plan review. The review must determine the extent to which the services
have met the goals and objectives in the previous treatment plan. The review must assess the client's
progress and ensure that services and treatment goals continue to be necessary and appropriate to
the client and the client's family or foster family. Revision of the individual treatment plan does not
require a new diagnostic assessment unless the client's mental health status has changed markedly.
The updated treatment plan must be signed by the client, if appropriate, and by the client's parent or
other person authorized by statute to give consent to the mental health services for the child.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Service delivery criteria. (a) In delivering services under this section, a certified
provider entity must ensure that:
    (1) each individual provider's caseload size permits the provider to deliver services to both
clients with severe, complex needs and clients with less intensive needs. The provider's caseload
size should reasonably enable the provider to play an active role in service planning, monitoring,
and delivering services to meet the client's and client's family's needs, as specified in each client's
individual treatment plan;
    (2) site-based programs, including day treatment and preschool programs, provide staffing and
facilities to ensure the client's health, safety, and protection of rights, and that the programs are able
to implement each client's individual treatment plan;

      (3) a day treatment program is provided to a group of clients by a multidisciplinary team under
the clinical supervision of a mental health professional. The day treatment program must be provided
in and by: (i) an outpatient hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health
Organizations and licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.55; (ii) a community mental health center
under section 245.62; and (iii) an entity that is under contract with the county board to operate a
program that meets the requirements of sections 245.4712, subdivision 2, and 245.4884, subdivision
2, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0170 to 9505.0475. The day treatment program must stabilize
the client's mental health status while developing and improving the client's independent living and
socialization skills. The goal of the day treatment program must be to reduce or relieve the effects
of mental illness and provide training to enable the client to live in the community. The program
must be available at least one day a week for a ­h                     t­­

aid who are not residents of a nursing home, a regional treatment center, or a group residential
housing facility.
    (a) The county agency shall pay a monthly allowance for medically prescribed diets if the cost
of those additional dietary needs cannot be met through some other maintenance benefit. The need
for special diets or dietary items must be prescribed by a licensed physician. Costs for special diets
shall be determined as percentages of the allotment for a one-person household under the thrifty
food plan as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture. The types of diets and the
percentages of the thrifty food plan that are covered are as follows:
   (1) high protein diet, at least 80 grams daily, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (2) controlled protein diet, 40 to 60 grams and requires special products, 100 percent of thrifty
food plan;

    (3) controlled protein diet, less than 40 grams and requires special products, 125 percent of
thrifty food plan;
   (4) low cholesterol diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (5) high residue diet, 20 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (6) pregnancy and lactation diet, 35 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (7) gluten-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (8) lactose-free diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (9) antidumping diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan;
   (10) hypoglycemic diet, 15 percent of thrifty food plan; or
   (11) ketogenic diet, 25 percent of thrifty food plan.
    (b) Payment for nonrecurring special needs must be allowed for necessary home repairs or
necessary repairs or replacement of household furniture and appliances using the payment standard
of the AFDC program in effect on July 16, 1996, for these expenses, as long as other funding sources
are not available.
    (c) A fee for guardian or conservator service is allowed at a reasonable rate negotiated by the
county or approved by the court. This rate shall not exceed five percent of the assistance unit's gross
monthly income up to a maximum of $100 per month. If the guardian or conservator is a member
of the county agency staff, no fee is allowed.
    (d) The county agency shall continue to pay a monthly allowance of $68 for restaurant meals for
a person who was receiving a restaurant meal allowance on June 1, 1990, and who eats two or more
meals in a restaurant daily. The allowance must continue until the person has not received Minnesota
supplemental aid for one full calendar month or until the person's living arrangement changes and
the person no longer meets the criteria for the restaurant meal allowance, whichever occurs first.
    (e) A fee of ten percent of the recipient's gross income or $25, whichever is less, is allowed
for representative payee services provided by an agency that meets the requirements under SSI
regulations to charge a fee for representative payee services. This special need is available to all
recipients of Minnesota supplemental aid regardless of their living arrangement.
    (f)(1) Notwithstanding the language in this subdivision, an amount equal to the maximum
allotment authorized by the federal Food Stamp Program for a single individual which is in
effect on the first day of July of each year will be added to the standards of assistance established
in subdivisions 1 to 4 for adults under the age of 65 who qualify as shelter needy and are: (i)
relocating from an institution, or an adult mental health residential treatment program under section
256B.0622; (ii) eligible for the self-directed supports option as defined under section 256B.0657,
subdivision 2; or (iii) home and community-based waiver recipients living in their own home or
rented or leased apartment which is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not
related by blood or marriage.
   (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives

this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.
     (g) Notwithstanding this subdivision, to access housing and services as provided in paragraph
(f), the recipient may choose housing that may or may not be owned, operated, or controlled by the
recipient's service provider if the housing is located in a multifamily building of six or more units.
The maximum number of units that may be used by recipients of this program shall be 50 percent
of the units in a building. The department shall develop an exception process to the 50 percent
maximum. This paragraph expires on June 30, 2011.

    (d) "Sexual abuse" means the subjection of a child by a person responsible for the child's care,
by a person who has a significant relationship to the child, as defined in section 609.341, or by a
person in a position of authority, as defined in section 609.341, subdivision 10, to any act which

    (3) failure to provide for necessary supervision or child care arrangements appropriate for a child

needs or safety of another child in their care;
   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,

sympathomimetic medications, consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5;
    (5) nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a child is neglected solely because
the child's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and
depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report

provide that care;
    (6) prenatal exposure to a controlled substance, as defined in section 253B.02, subdivision 2,

child's behavior, emotional response, or cognition that is not within the normal range for the child's
age and stage of development, with due regard to the child's culture.
    (g) "Physical abuse" means any physical injury, mental injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a
person responsible for the child's care on a child other than by accidental means, or any physical or

   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.556, subdivision 10e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10e. Determinations. (a) The local welfare agency shall conclude the family assessment

    (d) If the commissioner of education conducts an assessment or investigation, the commissioner
shall determine whether maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken

that maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken by the school facility.
In all other cases, the commissioner shall inform the school board or employer that a report was

57TH DAY]                             SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                         5965

    (e) When maltreatment is determined in an investigation involving a facility, the investigating
agency shall also determine whether the facility or individual was responsible, or whether both the
facility and the individual were responsible for the maltreatment using the mitigating factors in
paragraph (i). Determinations under this subdivision must be made based on a preponderance of the
evidence and are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as maintained by the commissioner
of education.
   (f) For the purposes of this subdivision, "maltreatment" means any of the following acts or
omissions:
   (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (g);
   (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (f);

   (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (m); or
   (5) maltreatment of a child in a facility as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (i).
    (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination that child protective services are
needed means that the local welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment
or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, as defined in section 626.559,
subdivision 1, to conclude that a child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective intervention
is not provided and that the individuals responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not
likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or risk of maltreatment.
    (h) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has occurred solely because the child's
parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and depends
upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu
of medical care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious danger to the child's health,
the local welfare agency may ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child.
   (i) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party, or whether
both the facility and the individual are responsible for determined maltreatment in a facility, the
investigating agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were according to, and followed
the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive; however,
this is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive or knew or should have known of
the errors and took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements placed
upon an employee, including the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and the
adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility training, an individual's participation in the
training, the caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the scope of the individual
employee's authority and discretion; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.

    (j) Notwithstanding paragraph (i), when maltreatment is determined to have been committed
by an individual who is also the facility license holder, both the individual and the facility must
be determined responsible for the maltreatment, and both the background study disqualification
standards under section 245C.15, subdivision 4, and the licensing actions under sections 245A.06
or 245A.07 apply.
    (k) Individual counties may implement more detailed definitions or criteria that indicate which
allegations to investigate, as long as a county's policies are consistent with the definitions in
the statutes and rules and are approved by the county board. Each local welfare agency shall
periodically inform mandated reporters under subdivision 3 who work in the county of the
definitions of maltreatment in the statutes and rules and any additional definitions or criteria that
have been approved by the county board.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.556, subdivision 10f, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10f. Notice of determinations. Within ten working days of the conclusion of a family
assessment, the local welfare agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of the need
for services to address child safety concerns or significant risk of subsequent child maltreatment.
The local welfare agency and the family may also jointly agree that family support and family
preservation services are needed. Within ten working days of the conclusion of an investigation, the
local welfare agency or agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report shall notify the
parent or guardian of the child, the person determined to be maltreating the child, and if applicable,
the director of the facility, of the determination and a summary of the specific reasons for the
determination. When the investigation involves a child foster care setting that is monitored by a
private licensing agency under section 245A.16, the local welfare agency responsible for assessing
or investigating the report shall notify the private licensing agency of the determination and shall
provide a summary of the specific reasons for the determination. The notice to the private licensing
agency must include identifying private data, but not the identity of the reporter of maltreatment.
The notice must also include a certification that the information collection procedures under
subdivision 10, paragraphs (h), (i), and (j), were followed and a notice of the right of a data subject
to obtain access to other private data on the subject collected, created, or maintained under this
section. In addition, the notice shall include the length of time that the records will be kept under
subdivision 11c. The investigating agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child who
is the subject of the report, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated a child, of
their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.022. The notice must also state
that a finding of maltreatment may result in denial of a license application or background study
disqualification under chapter 245C related to employment or services that are licensed by the
Department of Human Services under chapter 245A, the Department of Health under chapter 144
or 144A, the Department of Corrections under section 241.021, and from providing services related
to an unlicensed personal care provider organization under chapter 256B.
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.557, subdivision 9c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9c. Lead agency; notifications, dispositions, determinations. (a) Upon request of
the reporter, the lead agency shall notify the reporter that it has received the report, and provide
information on the initial disposition of the report within five business days of receipt of the report,
provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation.
   (b) Upon conclusion of every investigation it conducts, the lead agency shall make a final
57TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                         5967

disposition as defined in section 626.5572, subdivision 8.
   (c) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party for substantiated
maltreatment or whether both the facility and the individual are responsible for substantiated
maltreatment, the lead agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were in accordance with, and
followed the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, resident care plan, or directive.
This is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver is responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, plan, or directive or knows or should have known of the errors and
took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) the comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements
placed upon the employee, including but not limited to, the facility's compliance with related
regulatory standards and factors such as the adequacy of facility policies and procedures, the
adequacy of facility training, the adequacy of an individual's participation in the training, the
adequacy of caregiver supervision, the adequacy of facility staffing levels, and a consideration of
the scope of the individual employee's authority; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
    (d) When substantiated maltreatment is determined to have been committed by an individual
who is also the facility license holder, both the individual and the facility must be determined
responsible for the maltreatment, and both the background study disqualification standards under
section 245C.15, subdivision 4, and the licensing actions under section 245A.06 or 245A.07 apply.
    (e) The lead agency shall complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days. If the lead agency
is unable to complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days, the lead agency shall notify the
following persons provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the
investigation: (1) the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known, if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation; and (2) the facility, where applicable. The
notice shall contain the reason for the delay and the projected completion date. If the lead agency is
unable to complete its final disposition by a subsequent projected completion date, the lead agency
shall again notify the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation, and the facility, where applicable, of the
reason for the delay and the revised projected completion date provided that the notification will not
endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation. A lead agency's inability to complete the
final disposition within 60 calendar days or by any projected completion date does not invalidate
the final disposition.

     e­
      ) (f) Within ten calendar days of completing the final disposition, the lead agency shall provide
a copy of the public investigation memorandum under subdivision 12b, paragraph (b), clause (1),

or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known unless the lead agency knows that the notification
would endanger the well-being of the vulnerable adult; (2) the reporter, if the reporter requested
notification when making the report, provided this notification would not endanger the well-being of
the vulnerable adult; (3) the alleged perpetrator, if known; (4) the facility; and (5) the ombudsman for
long-term care, or the ombudsman for mental health and developmental disabilities, as appropriate.

   ­(­) (g) The lead agency shall notify the vulnerable adult who is the subject of the report or the
     f­
vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated
a vulnerable adult, of their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.021.
   ­(g
     ­­) (h) The lead agency shall routinely provide investigation memoranda for substantiated
reports to the appropriate licensing boards. These reports must include the names of substantiated
perpetrators. The lead agency may not provide investigative memoranda for inconclusive or false
reports to the appropriate licensing boards unless the lead agency's investigation gives reason
to believe that there may have been a violation of the applicable professional practice laws. If
the investigation memorandum is provided to a licensing board, the subject of the investigation
memorandum shall be notified and receive a summary of the investigative findings.
   ­
   (h
    ­­) (i) In order to avoid duplication, licensing boards shall consider the findings of the lead
agency in their investigations if they choose to investigate. This does not preclude licensing boards
from considering other information.
    ­i­ (j) The lead agency must provide to the commissioner of human services its final dispositions,
    (­)
including the names of all substantiated perpetrators. The commissioner of human services shall
establish records to retain the names of substantiated perpetrators.
   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.557, subdivision 12b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12b. Data management. (a) In performing any of the duties of this section as a lead
agency, the county social service agency shall maintain appropriate records. Data collected
by the county social service agency under this section are welfare data under section 13.46.
Notwithstanding section 13.46, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), data under this paragraph that
are inactive investigative data on an individual who is a vendor of services are private data on
individuals, as defined in section 13.02. The identity of the reporter may only be disclosed as
provided in paragraph (c).
   Data maintained by the common entry point are confidential data on individuals or protected
nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02. Notwithstanding section 138.163, the common entry
point shall destroy data three calendar years after date of receipt.
    (b) The commissioners of health and human services shall prepare an investigation
memorandum for each report alleging maltreatment investigated under this section. County
social service agencies must maintain private data on individuals but are not required to prepare
an investigation memorandum. During an investigation by the commissioner of health or the
commissioner of human services, data collected under this section are confidential data on
individuals or protected nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02. Upon completion of the
investigation, the data are classified as provided in clauses (1) to (3) and paragraph (c).
   (1) The investigation memorandum must contain the following data, which are public:
   (i) the name of the facility investigated;
   (ii) a statement of the nature of the alleged maltreatment;
   (iii) pertinent information obtained from medical or other records reviewed;
   (iv) the identity of the investigator;
57TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 17, 2009                                        5969

   (v) a summary of the investigation's findings;
   (vi) statement of whether the report was found to be substantiated, inconclusive, false, or that
no determination will be made;
   (vii) a statement of any action taken by the facility;
   (viii) a statement of any action taken by the lead agency; and
   (ix) when a lead agency's determination has substantiated maltreatment, a statement of whether
an individual, individuals, or a facility were responsible for the substantiated maltreatment, if
known.
    The investigation memorandum must be written in a manner which protects the identity of the
reporter and of the vulnerable adult and may not contain the names or, to the extent possible, data
on individuals or private data listed in clause (2).
    (2) Data on individuals collected and maintained in the investigation memorandum are private
data, including:
   (i) the name of the vulnerable adult;
   (ii) the identity of the individual alleged to be the perpetrator;
   (iii) the identity of the individual substantiated as the perpetrator; and
   (iv) the identity of all individuals interviewed as part of the investigation.
    (3) Other data on individuals maintained as part of an investigation under this section are private
data on individuals upon completion of the investigation.
    (c) After the assessment or investigation is completed, the name of the reporter must be
confidential. The subject of the report may compel disclosure of the name of the reporter only
with the consent of the reporter or upon a written finding by a court that the report was false and
there is evidence that the report was made in bad faith. This subdivision does not alter disclosure
responsibilities or obligations under the Rules of Criminal Procedure, except that where the identity
of the reporter is relevant to a criminal prosecution, the district court shall do an in-camera review
prior to determining whether to order disclosure of the identity of the reporter.
    (d) Notwithstanding section 138.163, data maintained under this section by the commissioners
of health and human services must be destroyed under the following schedule:
   (1) data from reports determined to be false, two years after the finding was made;
   (2) data from reports determined to be inconclusive, four years after the finding was made;
   (3) data from reports determined to be substantiated, seven years after the finding was made; and
    (4) data from reports which were not investigated by a lead agency and for which there is no
final disposition, two years from the date of the report.
    (e) The commissioners of health and human services shall each annually report to the legislature
and the governor on the number and type of reports of alleged maltreatment involving licensed
facilities reported under this section, the number of those requiring investigation under this section,
5970                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [57TH DAY

and the resolution of those investigations. The report shall identify:
   (1) whether and where backlogs of cases result in a failure to conform with statutory time frames;
   (2) where adequate coverage requires additional appropriations and staffing; and
   (3) any other trends that affect the safety of vulnerable adults.
   (f) Each lead agency must have a record retention policy.
    (g) Lead agencies, prosecuting authorities, and law enforcement agencies may exchange not
public data, as defined in section 13.02, if the agency or authority requesting the data determines that
the data are pertinent and necessary to the requesting agency in initiating, furthering, or completing
an investigation under this section. Data collected under this section must be made available to
prosecuting authorities and law enforcement officials, local county agencies, and licensing agencies
investigating the alleged maltreatment under this section. The lead agency shall exchange not public
data with the vulnerable adult maltreatment review panel established in section 256.021 if the data
are pertinent and necessary for a review requested under that section. Upon completion of the review,
not public data received by the review panel must be returned to the lead agency.
   (h) Each lead agency shall keep records of the length of time it takes to complete its
investigations.
    (i) A lead agency may notify other affected parties and their authorized representative if the
agency has reason to believe maltreatment has occurred and determines the information will
safeguard the well-being of the affected parties or dispel widespread rumor or unrest in the affected
facility.
    (j) Under any notification provision of this section, where federal law specifically prohibits the
disclosure of patient identifying information, a lead agency may not provide any notice unless the
vulnerable adult has consented to disclosure in a manner which conforms to federal requirements.
   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 626.5572, subdivision 13, is amended to read:

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 282.04, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Timber sales; land leases and uses. (a) The county auditor may sell timber upon
any tract that may be approved by the natural resources commissioner. The sale of timber shall be
made for cash at not less than the appraised value determined by the county board to the highest
bidder after not less than one week's published notice in an official paper within the county. Any
timber offered at the public sale and not sold may thereafter be sold at private sale by the county
auditor at not less than the appraised value thereof, until the time as the county board may withdraw
the timber from sale. The appraised value of the timber and the forestry practices to be followed in
the cutting of said timber shall be approved by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (b) Payment of the full sale price of all timber sold on tax-forfeited lands shall be made in cash at
the time of the timber sale, except in the case of oral or sealed bid auction sales, the down payment
shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised value, and the balance shall be paid prior to entry.
In the case of auction sales that are partitioned and sold as a single sale with predetermined cutting
blocks, the down payment shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised price of the entire timber
sale which may be held until the satisfactory completion of the sale or applied in whole or in part
to the final cutting block. The value of each separate block must be paid in full before any cutting
may begin in that block. With the permission of the county contract administrator the purchaser
may enter unpaid blocks and cut necessary timber incidental to developing logging roads as may
be needed to log other blocks provided that no timber may be removed from an unpaid block until
separately scaled and paid for. If payment is provided as specified in this paragraph as security
under paragraph (a) and no cutting has taken place on the contract, the county auditor may credit
the security provided, less any down payment required for an auction sale under this paragraph, to
any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under this chapter to which the contract
holder requests in writing that it be credited, provided the request and transfer is made within the
same calendar year as the security was received.
    (c) The county board may sell any timber, including biomass, as appraised or scaled. Any parcels
of land from which timber is to be sold by scale of cut products shall be so designated in the published
notice of sale under paragraph (a), in which case the notice shall contain a description of the parcels,
a statement of the estimated quantity of each species of timber, and the appraised price of each
species of timber for 1,000 feet, per cord or per piece, as the case may be. In those cases any bids
offered over and above the appraised prices shall be by percentage, the percent bid to be added to
the appraised price of each of the different species of timber advertised on the land. The purchaser
of timber from the parcels shall pay in cash at the time of sale at the rate bid for all of the timber
shown in the notice of sale as estimated to be standing on the land, and in addition shall pay at the

for cutting on the land at the time of sale under the terms of the sale. Where the final scale of cut
products shows that less timber was cut or was available for cutting under terms of the sale than
was originally paid for, the excess payment shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon
the claim of the purchaser, to be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims
against the county. No timber, except hardwood pulpwood, may be removed from the parcels of land
or other designated landings until scaled by a person or persons designated by the county board and
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. Landings other than the parcel of land from
which timber is cut may be designated for scaling by the county board by written agreement with
the purchaser of the timber. The county board may, by written agreement with the purchaser and
with a consumer designated by the purchaser when the timber is sold by the county auditor, and with
the approval of the commissioner of natural resources, accept the consumer's scale of cut products
delivered at the consumer's landing. No timber shall be removed until fully paid for in cash. Small
amounts of timber not exceeding $3,000 in appraised valuation may be sold for not less than the full
appraised value at private sale to individual persons without first publishing notice of sale or calling
for bids, provided that in case of a sale involving a total appraised value of more than $200 the sale
shall be made subject to final settlement on the basis of a scale of cut products in the manner above
provided and not more than two of the sales, directly or indirectly to any individual shall be in effect
at one time.
    (d) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, and at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for use as cottage and camp sites
and for agricultural purposes and for the purpose of taking and removing of hay, stumpage, sand,
gravel, clay, rock, marl, and black dirt from the land, and for garden sites and other temporary uses
provided that no leases shall be for a period to exceed ten years; provided, further that any leases
involving a consideration of more than $12,000 per year, except to an organized subdivision of the
state shall first be offered at public sale in the manner provided herein for sale of timber. Upon
the sale of any leased land, it shall remain subject to the lease for not to exceed one year from the
beginning of the term of the lease. Any rent paid by the lessee for the portion of the term cut off by
the cancellation shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the lessee, to
be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county.
    (e) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations, or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for the purpose of taking and
removing for use for road construction and other purposes tax-forfeited stockpiled iron-bearing
material. The county auditor must determine that the material is needed and suitable for use in
the construction or maintenance of a road, tailings basin, settling basin, dike, dam, bank fill, or
other works on public or private property, and that the use would be in the best interests of the
public. No lease shall exceed ten years. The use of a stockpile for these purposes must first be
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. The request shall be deemed approved unless
the requesting county is notified to the contrary by the commissioner of natural resources within
six months after receipt of a request for approval for use of a stockpile. Once use of a stockpile has
been approved, the county may continue to lease it for these purposes until approval is withdrawn
by the commissioner of natural resources.
   (f) The county auditor, with the approval of the county board is authorized to grant permits,

licenses, and leases to tax-forfeited lands for the depositing of stripping, lean ores, tailings, or waste
products from mines or ore milling plants, or to use for facilities needed to recover iron-bearing
oxides from tailings basins or stockpiles, or for a buffer area needed for a mining operation, upon
the conditions and for the consideration and for the period of time, not exceeding ­      15­ 25 years, as
the county board may determine. The permits, licenses, or leases are subject to approval by the
commissioner of natural resources.
    (g) Any person who removes any timber from tax-forfeited land before said timber has been
scaled and fully paid for as provided in this subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (h) The county auditor may, with the approval of the county board, and without first offering
at public sale, grant leases, for a term not exceeding 25 years, for the removal of peat and for
the production or removal of farm-grown closed-loop biomass as defined in section 216B.2424,
subdivision 1, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands upon the terms and conditions
as the county board may prescribe. Any lease for the removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop
biomass, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands must first be reviewed and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources if the lease covers 320 or more acres. No lease for the
removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop biomass, or short-rotation woody crops shall be made by
the county auditor pursuant to this section without first holding a public hearing on the auditor's
intention to lease. One printed notice in a legal newspaper in the county at least ten days before the
hearing, and posted notice in the courthouse at least 20 days before the hearing shall be given of the
hearing.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c) to the contrary, the St. Louis County auditor
may, at the discretion of the county board, sell timber to the party who bids the highest price for all
the several kinds of timber, as provided for sales by the commissioner of natural resources under
section 90.14. Bids offered over and above the appraised price need not be applied proportionately
to the appraised price of each of the different species of timber.
    (j) In lieu of any payment or deposit required in paragraph (b), as directed by the county board
and under terms set by the county board, the county auditor may accept an irrevocable bank letter
of credit in the amount equal to the amount otherwise determined in paragraph (b). If an irrevocable
bank letter of credit is provided under this paragraph, at the written request of the purchaser, the
county may periodically allow the bank letter of credit to be reduced by an amount proportionate
to the value of timber that has been harvested and for which the county has received payment. The
remaining amount of the bank letter of credit after a reduction under this paragraph must not be less
than 20 percent of the value of the timber purchased. If an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash
deposit is provided for the down payment required in paragraph (b), and no cutting of timber has
taken place on the contract for which a letter of credit has been provided, the county may allow the
transfer of the letter of credit to any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under
this chapter to which the contract holder requests in writing that it be credited.
