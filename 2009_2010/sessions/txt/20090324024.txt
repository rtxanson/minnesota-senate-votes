    Senator Marty from the Committee on Health, Housing and Family Security, to which was
referred
    S.F. No. 347: A bill for an act relating to health; waiving the four-month waiting period for
unemployed persons for MinnesotaCare; appropriating money; amending Minnesota Statutes 2008,
section 256L.07, by adding a subdivision.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
  "Section 1. TEMPORARY MINNESOTACARE COVERAGE FOR UNEMPLOYED
WORKERS.
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility requirement. An applicant for unemployment benefits is eligible for
temporary MinnesotaCare coverage without meeting any of the eligibility criteria under Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 256L, if:
   (1) the applicant was laid off from their most recent employment due to lack of work, and the
layoff is not expected by the applicant or the employer to be temporary;
   (2) the layoff was not due to the seasonal nature of the applicant's work;
   (3) the applicant has served the nonpayable waiting week under Minnesota Statutes, section
268.085, subdivision 1, clause (5);
   (4) the applicant resides in Minnesota;
   (5) the applicant has wages paid of $5,000 or more in each of the eight consecutive calendar
quarters before the effective date of the application for unemployment benefits;
   (6) the applicant's spouse does not have health care coverage available through the spouse's
employer in which the applicant could be considered a dependent and receive health care through
dependent coverage;
  (7) the applicant is not eligible for federal reimbursement or federal payment of a portion of
COBRA premiums under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; and
930                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [24TH DAY

   (8) at the time of application for unemployment benefits, these benefits are the applicant's
primary source of income.
    Subd. 2. Family coverage. If the applicant meets the criteria under subdivision 1, the applicant's
family is also eligible for temporary MinnesotaCare under this section and is not required to
meet eligibility criteria under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 256L. For purposes of this subdivision,
"family" has the meaning provided in Minnesota Rules, part 9506.0010, subpart 11, and shall
include any family member who was covered under any health coverage provided by the applicant's
most recent employer and who does not have other health coverage available.
    Subd. 3. Covered services. Temporary MinnesotaCare coverage under this section shall include
all health services provided under Minnesota Statutes, section 256L.03.
    Subd. 4. Notice and application. The commissioner of employment and economic development
must, as part of the application for unemployment benefits, inform an applicant that temporary
MinnesotaCare coverage may be available. If the applicant elects coverage, then as part of that
application process, the commissioner of employment and economic development must obtain
information necessary to determine temporary MinnesotaCare eligibility under this section.
This information must be immediately provided to the commissioner of human services. The
commissioner of human services must determine if the applicant for unemployment benefits
is eligible for temporary MinnesotaCare coverage and notify the applicant accordingly. The
commissioner of human services must automatically enroll the applicant and the applicant's family
members in temporary MinnesotaCare coverage if eligible under this section. An enrollee or the
enrollee's family members shall be disenrolled if other health care coverage becomes available to
the enrollee or the enrollee's family members or the period of coverage provided under this section
expires.
   Subd. 5. Payments by individual. If the individual is deemed eligible for temporary
MinnesotaCare, ten percent of an individual's weekly unemployment benefit amount shall be
deducted and withheld from the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit payment in accordance
with section 4. The individual and the individual's family members are exempt from the premium
requirements in section 256L.15.
   Subd. 6. Cost sharing. Individuals covered under this section are subject to the cost-sharing
requirements specified in Minnesota Statutes, section 256L.03, subdivision 5, except that the ten
percent coinsurance requirement for inpatient hospital services described in section 256L.03,
subdivision 5, paragraph (a), clause (1), does not apply.
    Subd. 7. Managed care exemption. Individuals covered under this section are exempt from
managed care enrollment under Minnesota Statutes, section 256L.12, and services provided shall
be reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis payable exclusively with funds from the workforce health
coverage account created in section 3.
    Subd. 8. Duration of coverage. Individuals are eligible for temporary MinnesotaCare under
this section for five calendar months. The five-calendar months period begins on the first day of the
month following the date the commissioner of human services receives the eligibility information
from the commissioner of employment and economic development under subdivision 4. At the end
of this period, an individual may apply for MinnesotaCare in accordance with chapter 256L, and
eligibility criteria must be met with the exception of section 256L.07, subdivision 3.
24TH DAY]                         TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2009                                         931

    Subd. 9. Expiration. Enrollment in temporary MinnesotaCare may not be made under this
section after July 31, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010.
   Sec. 2. WORKFORCE SUPPORT FEE.
    Subdivision 1. Fee. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 116L.20, the special
assessment under that section on taxable wages as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 268.035,
subdivision 24, is suspended from January 1, 2010, until December 31, 2012. Effective January
1, 2010, there is assessed, in addition to unemployment taxes due under Minnesota Statutes,
section 268.051, a workforce support fee of .3 percent on taxable wages. This fee is due and must
be paid on the same schedule and in the same manner as unemployment taxes under Minnesota
Statutes, section 268.051. Any amount past due under this section is subject to the same interest
and collection provisions as unemployment taxes. This fee expires on December 31, 2012.
    Subd. 2. Use of funds collected. An amount equal to .1 percent on taxable wages is deposited
in the workforce development fund provided for under Minnesota Statutes, section 116L.20, less
reimbursement for one-half of the collection cost of the total amount of the fee. An amount equal
to .2 percent on taxable wages, less reimbursement for one-half of the collection costs of the total
amount of the fee, is deposited in the workforce health coverage account created in section 3.
   Sec. 3. WORKFORCE HEALTH COVERAGE ACCOUNT.
    (a) Effective January 1, 2010, the workforce health coverage account is created as a special
account in the special revenue fund in the state treasury. This account lapses on June 30, 2014, and
any money remaining in the account on that date must be paid into the unemployment insurance
program trust fund. This account consists of all money collected by the workforce support fee
provided by section 2 and designated for deposit in this account and all money deducted and withheld
from an applicant's unemployment benefit payment for temporary MinnesotaCare coverage under
section 1 and all interest earned on any money in this account, less reimbursement of collection
costs under paragraph (d).
   (b) Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner of human services and is allocated
and may be expended only to pay for the cost of temporary MinnesotaCare coverage under section
1.
    (c) Any funds not allocated, obligated, or expended in a fiscal year are available for allocation,
obligation, and expenditure in the following fiscal year.
    (d) Because the administrative cost of collection of the workforce support fee is borne by federal
money made available only to administer the unemployment insurance program, the commissioner
of employment and economic development must negotiate with the United States Department of
Labor the amount of any reimbursement for costs related to the collection of the fee.
   Sec. 4. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE DEDUCTION.
    (a) An applicant for unemployment benefits who meets the eligibility requirement for temporary
MinnesotaCare coverage for unemployed workers must have the option of electing MinnesotaCare
coverage. If the applicant elects coverage and is determined eligible for temporary MinnesotaCare,
the commissioner of employment and economic development must deduct and withhold ten percent
932                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [24TH DAY

of the applicant's weekly benefit amount from any payment made to the applicant. The weekly
benefit amount is that amount computed under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.07, subdivision
2. This deduction occurs after all other deductions and adjustments. If the unemployment benefit
payment prior to this deduction is insufficient to cover the ten percent cost, the payment to the
applicant for that week is reduced to zero, but the applicant is not liable for the deficiency.
    (b) The amount deducted and withheld from the applicant's unemployment benefit payment must
be immediately deposited into the workforce health coverage account.
   (c) The amount deducted is for all purposes considered and treated as if it were paid to the
applicant as unemployment benefits."

   The election judges shall mark the return envelope "Accepted" and initial or sign the return
envelope below the word "Accepted" if the election judges or a majority of them are satisfied that:
    (1) the voter's name and address on the return envelope are the same as the information provided
on the absentee ballot application;
    (2) the voter's signature on the return envelope is the genuine signature of the individual who
made the application for ballots and the certificate has been completed as prescribed in the directions
for casting an absentee ballot, except that if a person other than the voter applied for the absentee
ballot under applicable Minnesota Rules, the signature is not required to match;
     (3) the voter is registered and eligible to vote in the precinct or has included a properly completed

voter registration application in the return envelope; and
     (4) the voter has not already voted at that election, either in person or by absentee ballot.
   There is no other reason for rejecting an absentee ballot. In particular, failure to place the ballot
within the security envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject
an absentee ballot.
     The return envelope from accepted ballots must be preserved and returned to the county auditor.
    If all or a majority of the election judges examining return envelopes find that an absent voter
has failed to meet one of the requirements prescribed in clauses (1) to (4), they shall mark the return
envelope "Rejected," initial or sign it below the word "Rejected," and return it to the county auditor.

     (b) the candidate's name and residence address, including street and number if any; and
     (c) the candidate's political party or political principle expressed in not more than three words.
No candidate who files for a partisan office by nominating petition shall use the term "nonpartisan"
as a statement of political principle or the name of the candidate's political party. No part of the name
of a major political party may be used to designate the political party or principle of a candidate who
files for a partisan office by nominating petition, except that the word "independent" may be used
to designate the party or principle. A            ­­ ­­

cast at the general election for that office are invalid and the office must be filled in a special election
held in accordance with section 204D.17, except as provided by this section.
    Except for the vacancy in nomination, all other candidates whose names would have appeared
on the general election ballot for this race must appear on the special election ballot for this race.
There must not be a primary to fill the vacancy in nomination.
    A major political party has the authority to fill a vacancy in nomination of that party's candidate
by filing a nomination certificate with the same official who received the affidavits of candidacy for
that office.

of an appropriate committee, to fill vacancies in nomination for all federal and state offices ­                                      e­e

a polling place for the remainder of the election day for failure to comply with the requirements of
this section. A challenger shall not:
