The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 1481 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 1481 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. RETIREMENT INCENTIVE.
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility. (a) An eligible appointing authority may provide the retirement
incentive in this section to an employee who:
    (1) has at least 15 years of allowable service in one or more of the funds listed in Minnesota
Statutes, section 356.30, subdivision 3, or has at least 15 years of coverage by the individual
retirement account plan governed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 354B, and upon retirement is
immediately eligible for a retirement annuity or benefit from one or more of these funds;
   (2) accepts the incentive no later than December 31, 2010, and retires no later than June 30,
2011; and
   (3) is not in receipt of a retirement plan, retirement annuity, retirement allowance, or service
pension from a fund listed in Minnesota Statutes, section 356.30, subdivision 3, during the month
preceding the termination of qualified employment.
    (b) An eligible appointing authority is any appointing authority in the executive, legislative, or
judicial branch of state government, the Public Employees Retirement Association, the Minnesota
State Retirement System, the Teachers Retirement Association, or the Minnesota State Colleges and
Universities.
   (c) An elected official is not eligible to receive an incentive under this section.
    (d) An employee who, after termination of employment, receives an employer contribution
for health insurance may not receive a payment for health insurance under this section from that
appointing authority.
    Subd. 2. Incentive. For an employee eligible under subdivision 1, the appointing authority
will deposit into the employee's account in the health care savings plan established in Minnesota
Statutes, section 352.98, up to 24 months of the employer contribution, as specified in the
100TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MAY 8, 2010                                      10685

collective bargaining agreement or compensation plan covering the position from which the
employee terminates service, for health and dental insurance for the employee, and, if the employee
had dependent coverage immediately before retirement, for the employee's dependents. The
contributions provided under this section are those the employee was receiving as of the date of
termination, subject to any changes in contributions specified in the collective bargaining agreement
or compensation plan covering the position from which the employee terminated service.
    Subd. 3. Employer discretion; implementation. Provision of an incentive under this section
is at the discretion of the appointing authority. Appointing authorities in the executive branch
must apply for approval from the commissioner of management and budget before providing
early retirement incentives under this section. All appointing authorities and the commissioner's
review must give consideration to issues such as equity within the agency, budgetary constraints,
and workforce planning concerns. The appointing authority will determine the date of retirement
upon consultation with the employee. Unilateral implementation of this section by the appointing
authority is not an unfair labor practice under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 179A.
    Subd. 4. Acceptance. An employee who is eligible for an incentive under this section, who is
offered an incentive by the appointing authority, and who accepts the incentive offer must do so in
writing. A copy of the acceptance document must be provided by the appointing authority to the
applicable retirement plan within 15 days of its execution.
    Subd. 5. Reemployment prohibition. An individual who receives an incentive payment under
this section may not be reemployed or hired as a consultant by any agency or entity that participates
in the State Employee Group Insurance Program for a period of three years after termination of
service.
   Subd. 6. Report. The commissioner of management and budget must report to the legislature
by April 2, 2011, regarding use of the retirement incentive for calendar year 2010, with a
recommendation regarding renewal of the incentive.
   Sec. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Section 1 is effective the day following final enactment."
   Delete the title and insert:
    "A bill for an act relating to state government finance; authorizing retirement incentives for
certain state employees."
   We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

    (1) the commissioner of agriculture certifies and publishes the certification in the State Register
that at least 20 percent of the volume of gasoline sold in the state is denatured ethanol; or
    (2) federal approval has not been granted under paragraph (a), clause (1). The United States
Environmental Protection Agency's failure to act on an application shall not be deemed approval
under paragraph (a), clause (1), or a waiver under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act, United
States Code, title 42, section 7545, subsection (f), paragraph (4).
       EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

    Subd. 2a. Federal Clean Air Act waivers; conditions. (a) Before a waiver granted by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act, United States
Code, title 42, section 7545, subsection (f), paragraph (4), may alter the minimum content level
required by subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), or subdivision 1a, paragraph (a), clause (2), the
waiver must:
       (1) apply to all gasoline-powered motor vehicles irrespective of model year; and
   (2) allow for special regulatory treatment of Reid vapor pressure under Code of Federal
Regulations, title 40, section 80.27(d), for blends of gasoline and ethanol up to the maximum
percent of denatured ethanol by volume authorized under the waiver.
    (b) The minimum ethanol requirement in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), or subdivision
1a, paragraph (a), clause (2), shall, upon the grant of the federal waiver, be effective the day after
the commissioner of commerce publishes notice in the State Register. In making this determination,
the commissioner shall consider the amount of time required by refiners, retailers, pipeline
and distribution terminal companies, and other fuel suppliers, acting expeditiously, to make the
operational and logistical changes required to supply fuel in compliance with the minimum ethanol
requirement.

     (b) The secretary of state shall maintain the information in the farm products statutory lien master
list by county arranged alphabetically by debtor.
   (c) The secretary of state shall distribute or make available the requested master and partial
master lists on a monthly basis to farm product dealers registered under section 336A.11. Lists will
be distributed or made available on or before the tenth day of each month or on the next business
day thereafter if the tenth day is not a business day.
    (d) The secretary of state shall make the master and partial master lists available as written or
printed paper documents and may make lists available in other forms or media, including:
    (1) any electronically transmitted medium; or
    (2) any form of digital media.
     (e) There shall be no fee for partial or master lists distributed via an electronically transmitted
medium. The annual fee for any other form of digital media is $200. The annual fee for paper partial
lists is $250 and $400 for paper master lists.

farm products dealer with new monthly lists in the medium chosen by the registered farm products
dealer no later than five business days after receipt of the oral notice from the registered farm

until five days have passed since the duplicate lists were deposited in the mail by the secretary of
state, whichever comes first.
     (h) On receipt of a written notice pursuant to section 336A.13, the secretary of state shall

of the written notice from the registered farm products dealer.
    (i) A registered farm products dealer may request monthly lists in one medium per registration.

July each year. Failure to send in the registration before that date will result in the farm products
dealer not receiving the requested monthly lists.

transmitted medium or in any form of digital media may choose to receive all of the information
for the monthly lists requested the first month and then only additions and deletions to the database

of the Forest and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services of the United States Department
of Agriculture, local units of government, the nursery industry, and the timber industry. The
commissioners shall report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.195, no later than
September 1, 2010.
    (b) The recommendations must outline current funding sources for forest pest survey, treatment,
quarantine, and outreach activities and must explore and evaluate alternative or additional funding
options. The workgroup shall also report on:
    (1) the public and private sector benefits of forest pest survey, detection, eradication and outreach
efforts;
    (2) potential ramifications if the state discontinues efforts to control forest pests, including but
not limited to the economic and commercial impact of a statewide quarantine and the environmental
consequences of forests pests left unabated;
    (3) clarifying statutory and regulatory roles and responsibilities of state agencies and local
units of government as well as identifying and evaluating options for consolidating these roles and
responsibilities; and
   (4) the roles that federal agencies play in managing and regulating invasive forest pests.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 1.141, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Folding of the state flag for presentation or display. The following procedures
constitute the proper way to fold the Minnesota State Flag for presentation or display. Fold the
flag four times lengthwise so that one section displays the three stars of the state crest and the text
"L'Etoile du Nord." Fold each side behind the displayed section at a 90-degree angle so that the
display section forms a triangle. Take the section ending with the hoist and fold it at a 90-degree
angle across the bottom of the display section and then fold the hoist back over so it is aligned
with the middle of the display section. Fold the other protruding section directly upwards so that
its edge is flush with the display section and then fold it upwards along a 45-degree angle so that
a mirror of the display section triangle is formed. Fold the mirror section in half from the point
upwards, then fold the remaining portion upwards, tucking it between the display section and the
remainder of the flag.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 1.141, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Folding of the state flag for storage. When folding the Minnesota State Flag for
storage, the proper procedure is to fold and store the flag in the same manner as the national colors.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 16C.16, subdivision 6a, is amended to

     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.35, is amended to read:
     123B.35 GENERAL POLICY.
    It is the policy of the state of Minnesota that public school education shall be free and no
pupil shall be denied an education because of economic inability to furnish educational books and
supplies necessary to complete educational requirements necessary for graduation. Any practice
leading to suspension, coercion, exclusion, withholding of grades or diplomas, or discriminatory
action based upon nonpayment of fees denies pupils their right to equal protection and entitled
privileges. It is recognized that school boards do have the right to accept voluntary contributions
­
a­
 nd­, to make certain charges and to establish fees in areas considered extra curricular, noncurricular
or supplementary to the requirements for the successful completion of a class or educational
program, and to waive those fees under certain circumstances. No public school board may require,
except as authorized by sections 123B.36 and 123B.38, the payment of fees.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 197.46, is amended to read:
  197.46 VETERANS PREFERENCE ACT; REMOVAL FORBIDDEN; RIGHT OF
MANDAMUS.
100TH DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 8, 2010                                        10715

     Any person whose rights may be in any way prejudiced contrary to any of the provisions of
this section, shall be entitled to a writ of mandamus to remedy the wrong. No person holding a
position by appointment or employment in the several counties, cities, towns, school districts and
all other political subdivisions in the state, who is a veteran separated from the military service under
honorable conditions, shall be removed from such position or employment except for incompetency
or misconduct shown after a hearing, upon due notice, upon stated charges, in writing.
    Any veteran who has been notified of the intent to discharge the veteran from an appointed
position or employment pursuant to this section shall be notified in writing of such intent to discharge
and of the veteran's right to request a hearing within 60 days of receipt of the notice of intent to
discharge. The failure of a veteran to request a hearing within the provided 60-day period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Such failure shall also waive all other available legal
remedies for reinstatement.
    Request for a hearing concerning such a discharge shall be made in writing and submitted by
mail or personal service to the employment office of the concerned employer or other appropriate
office or person.
    In all governmental subdivisions having an established civil service board or commission, or
merit system authority, such hearing for removal or discharge shall be held before such civil service
board or commission or merit system authority. Where no such civil service board or commission
or merit system authority exists, such hearing shall be held by a board of three persons appointed
as follows: one by the governmental subdivision, one by the veteran, and the third by the two so
selected. In the event the two persons so selected do not appoint the third person within ten days after
the appointment of the last of the two, then the judge of the district court of the county wherein the
proceeding is pending, or if there be more than one judge in said county then any judge in chambers,
shall have jurisdiction to appoint, and upon application of either or both of the two so selected shall
appoint, the third person to the board and the person so appointed by the judge with the two first
selected shall constitute the board. The veteran may appeal from the decision of the board upon
the charges to the district court by causing written notice of appeal, stating the grounds thereof, to
be served upon the governmental subdivision or officer making the charges within 15 days after
notice of the decision and by filing the original notice of appeal with proof of service thereof in the
office of the court administrator of the district court within ten days after service thereof. Nothing
in section 197.455 or this section shall be construed to apply to the position of private secretary,
superintendent of schools, or one chief deputy of any elected official or head of a department, or to
any person holding a strictly confidential relation to the appointing officer. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to apply to the position of teacher. The burden of establishing such relationship
shall be upon the appointing officer in all proceedings and actions relating thereto.
    All officers, boards, commissions, and employees shall conform to, comply with, and aid in all
proper ways in carrying into effect the provisions of section 197.455 and this section notwithstanding
any laws, charter provisions, ordinances or rules to the contrary. Any willful violation of such
sections by officers, officials, or employees is a misdemeanor.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2790 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 2790 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 245C.24, subdivision 2, is amended
to read:
    Subd. 2. Permanent bar to set aside a disqualification. (a) Except as otherwise provided

                (b
                 ­­) this subdivision, the commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of any
individual disqualified pursuant to this chapter, regardless of how much time has passed, if the
individual was disqualified for a crime or conduct listed in section 245C.15, subdivision 1.
    (b) For an individual in the chemical dependency or corrections field who was disqualified for
a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, and whose disqualification was
set aside prior to July 1, 2005, the commissioner must consider granting a variance pursuant to
section 245C.30 for the license holder for a program dealing primarily with adults. A request for
reconsideration evaluated under this paragraph must include a letter of recommendation from the
license holder that was subject to the prior set-aside decision addressing the individual's quality of
care to children or vulnerable adults and the circumstances of the individual's departure from that
service.

    (c) When a licensed foster care provider adopts an individual who had received foster care
services from the provider for over six months, and the adopted individual is required to receive
a background study under section 245C.03, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2) or (6), the
commissioner may grant a variance to the license holder under section 245C.30 to permit the adopted
individual with a permanent disqualification to remain affiliated with the license holder under the
conditions of the variance when the variance is recommended by the county of responsibility for
each of the remaining individuals in placement in the home and the licensing agency for the home.
    (d) The commissioner shall consider granting a set aside under section 245C.22 or a variance
under section 245C.30 to an individual who is now 21 years of age or older and who was disqualified
for a crime or conduct listed under section 245C.15, subdivision 1, occurring while the individual
was under the age of 18. This paragraph does not apply to individuals who were convicted of the
disqualifying crime following certification under section 260B.125.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to be
delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600
to 9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse
the court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall order a children's mental health screening and a chemical use screening
conducted when a child is found to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a
screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by
a mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer
who is trained in the use of the screening instrument. If the approved instrument includes screening
for mental health and chemical use, a single screening fulfills both requirements. If the screening
indicates a need for a mental health assessment, the local social services agency, in consultation
with the child's family, shall have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a functional
assessment, as defined in section 245.4871. If the screening indicates a need for a chemical use
assessment, a referral must be made, in consultation with the child's family, for a chemical use
assessment, as defined in section 254A.03, subdivision 3.
   With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent, in order that the condition of the minor be given due consideration

in the disposition of the case. Any funds received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not
cancel until the end of the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which the funds were
received. The funds are available for use by the commissioner of corrections during that period and
are hereby appropriated annually to the commissioner of corrections as reimbursement of the costs
of providing these services to the juvenile courts.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 260B.176, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Reasons for detention. (a) If the child is not released as provided in subdivision 1, the
person taking the child into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the
child and the reasons for detention.
    (b) No child may be detained in a juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility longer
than 36 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, after being taken into custody for a
delinquent act as defined in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless a petition has been filed and the
judge or referee determines pursuant to section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in detention.
    (c) No child may be detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a
standard metropolitan statistical area, after being taken into custody for a delinquent act as defined
in section 260B.007, subdivision 6, unless:
   (1) a petition has been filed under section 260B.141; and
    (2) a judge or referee has determined under section 260B.178 that the child shall remain in
detention.
    After August 1, 1991, no child described in this paragraph may be detained in an adult jail or
municipal lockup longer than 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, or longer than
six hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup in a standard metropolitan statistical area, unless the
requirements of this paragraph have been met and, in addition, a motion to refer the child for adult
prosecution has been made under section 260B.125. Notwithstanding this paragraph, continued
detention of a child in an adult detention facility outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area
county is permissible if:
    (i) the facility in which the child is detained is located where conditions of distance to be traveled
or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours. A delay not to
exceed 48 hours may be made under this clause; or
    (ii) the facility is located where conditions of safety exist. Time for an appearance may be delayed
until 24 hours after the time that conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. "Conditions of safety"
include adverse life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel.
    The continued detention of a child under clause (i) or (ii) must be reported to the commissioner
of corrections.
    (d) If a child described in paragraph (c) is to be detained in a jail beyond 24 hours, excluding
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, the judge or referee, in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the commissioner of corrections, shall notify the commissioner of the place of
the detention and the reasons therefor. The commissioner shall thereupon assist the court in the
relocation of the child in an appropriate juvenile secure detention facility or approved jail within

the county or elsewhere in the state, or in determining suitable alternatives. The commissioner
shall direct that a child detained in a jail be detained after eight days from and including the date of
the original detention order in an approved juvenile secure detention facility with the approval of
the administrative authority of the facility. If the court refers the matter to the prosecuting authority
pursuant to section 260B.125, notice to the commissioner shall not be required.
     (e) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a children's
mental health screening conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of
human services, unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child
is currently under the care of a mental health professional. The screening shall be conducted by a
mental health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who
is trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention. The
results of the screening may only be presented to the court at the dispositional phase of the court
proceedings on the matter unless the parent or legal guardian consents to presentation at a different
time. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency or probation
officer, with the approval of the child's parent or legal guardian, shall have a diagnostic assessment
conducted, including a functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    (f) When a child is detained for an alleged delinquent act in a state licensed juvenile facility or
program, or when a child is detained in an adult jail or municipal lockup as provided in paragraph (c),
the supervisor of the facility shall, if the child's parent or legal guardian consents, have a chemical
use screen conducted with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services,
unless a screening has been performed within the previous 180 days or the child is currently under
the care of a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. The screening shall be conducted by a mental
health practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is
trained in the use of the screening instrument. The screening shall be conducted after the initial
detention hearing has been held and the court has ordered the child continued in detention.

to be granted only upon clear and convincing evidence that it would yield a benefit to the petitioner
commensurate with the disadvantages to the public and public safety of:
   (1) sealing the record; and
   (2) burdening the court and public authorities to issue, enforce, and monitor an expungement
order.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, If the petitioner is petitioning for the
sealing of a criminal or juvenile record under section 609A.02, subdivision 3, the court shall grant
the petition to seal the record unless the agency or jurisdiction whose records would be affected
establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the interests of the public and public safety
outweigh the disadvantages to the petitioner of not sealing the record.
    (c) If the petitioner is petitioning for the sealing of a criminal or delinquency record under section
609A.02, subdivision 2, clause (1) or (2), the court shall grant the petition to seal the record unless the

that the interests of the public and public safety outweigh the disadvantages to the petitioner of not
sealing the record.
    (d) If the court issues an expungement order it may require that the criminal or juvenile record be
sealed, the existence of the record not be revealed, and the record not be opened except as required
under subdivision 7. Records must not be destroyed or returned to the subject of the record.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609A.03, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Order concerning crimes of violence. An order expunging the record of a conviction
or delinquency record for a crime of violence as defined in section 624.712, subdivision 5, must
provide that the person is not entitled to ship, transport, possess, or receive a firearm for the
remainder of the person's lifetime. Any person whose record of conviction or delinquency record
is expunged under this section and who thereafter receives a relief of disability under United States
Code, title 18, section 925, or whose ability to possess firearms has been restored under section
609.165, subdivision 1d, is not subject to the restriction in this subdivision.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 609A.03, subdivision 7, is amended to read:

supported by probable cause, the DNA samples and DNA records held by the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension and collected under authority other than section 299C.105, shall not be sealed,
returned to the subject of the record, or destroyed.
   (b) Notwithstanding the issuance of an expungement order:

cross-references to state laws that are collateral sanctions imposed on a juvenile as a result of an
adjudication of delinquency. The revisor shall create a structure that categorizes these laws in a
useful way to users.
   (b) The revisor shall include appropriate cautionary language with the table, including, at a
minimum, language that notifies users that:
   (1) the list of collateral sanctions laws is intended to be comprehensive but is not necessarily
complete;
    (2) the inclusion or exclusion of a collateral sanction is not intended to have any substantive
legal effect; and
   (3) users must consult the language of each cross-referenced law to fully understand the scope
and effect of the collateral sanction it imposes.
   (c) The revisor shall consult with legislative staff and the chairs of the senate and house
committees having jurisdiction over criminal justice to identify laws that impose collateral
sanctions on a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent.

    (c) Within 90 days after the receipt of a complete application for a certificate of authority,
the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to the applicant if the commissioner
determines that the applicant meets the minimum criteria requirements of subdivision 2 for health
data intermediaries or subdivision 3 for health information organizations. If the commissioner
determines that the applicant is not qualified, the commissioner shall notify the applicant and
specify the reasons for disqualification.
    (d) Upon being granted a certificate of authority to operate as a health information organization,
the organization must operate in compliance with the provisions of this section. Noncompliance
may result in the imposition of a fine or the suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority
according to section 62J.4982.
    Subd. 5. Reciprocal agreements between health information exchange entities. (a)
Reciprocal agreements between two health information organizations or between a health
information organization and a health data intermediary must include a fair and equitable model
for charges between the entities that:
   (1) does not impede the secure transmission of transactions necessary to achieve meaningful
use;
   (2) does not charge a fee for the exchange of meaningful use transactions transmitted according
to nationally recognized standards where no additional value-added service is rendered to the
sending or receiving health information organization or health data intermediary either directly or
on behalf of the client;
   (3) is consistent with fair market value and proportionately reflects the value-added services
accessed as a result of the agreement; and

   (4) prevents health care stakeholders from being charged multiple times for the same service.
   (b) Reciprocal agreements must include comparable quality of service standards that ensure
equitable levels of services.
   (c) Reciprocal agreements are subject to review and approval by the commissioner.
    (d) Nothing in this section precludes a state-certified health information organization or
state-certified health data intermediary from entering into contractual agreements for the provision
of value-added services beyond meaningful use.
    (e) The commissioner of human services or health, when providing access to data or services
through a certified health information organization, must offer the same data or services directly
through any certified health information organization at the same pricing, if the health information
organization pays for all connection costs to the state data or service. For all external connectivity
to the respective agencies through existing or future information exchange implementations, the
respective agency shall establish the required connectivity methods as well as protocol standards to
be utilized.
    Subd. 6. State participation in health information exchange. A state agency that connects
to a health information exchange service provider for the purpose of exchanging meaningful
use transactions must ensure that the contracted health information exchange service provider
has reciprocal agreements in place as required by this section. The reciprocal agreements must
provide equal access to information supplied by the agency as necessary for meaningful use by the
participating entities of the other health information service providers.
   Sec. 8. [62J.4982] ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY; COMPLIANCE.
    Subdivision 1. Penalties and enforcement. (a) The commissioner may, for any violation of
statute or rule applicable to a health information exchange service provider, levy an administrative
penalty in an amount up to $25,000 for each violation. In determining the level of an administrative
penalty, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
   (1) the number of participating entities affected by the violation;
    (2) the effect of the violation on participating entities' access to health information exchange
services;
    (3) if only one participating entity is affected, the effect of the violation on the patients of that
entity;
   (4) whether the violation is an isolated incident or part of a pattern of violations;
    (5) the economic benefits derived by the health information organization or a health data
intermediary by virtue of the violation;
   (6) whether the violation hindered or facilitated an individual's ability to obtain health care;
   (7) whether the violation was intentional;
    (8) whether the violation was beyond the direct control of the health information exchange
service provider;
10742                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [100TH DAY

   (9) any history of prior compliance with the provisions of this section, including violations;
    (10) whether and to what extent the health information exchange service provider attempted to
correct previous violations;
   (11) how the health information exchange service provider responded to technical assistance
from the commissioner provided in the context of a compliance effort; and
    (12) the financial condition of the health information exchange service provider including, but
not limited to, whether the health information exchange service provider had financial difficulties
that affected its ability to comply or whether the imposition of an administrative monetary penalty
would jeopardize the ability of the health information exchange service provider to continue to
deliver health information exchange services.
    The commissioner shall give reasonable notice in writing to the health information exchange
service provider of the intent to levy the penalty and the reasons for them. A health information
exchange service provider may have 15 days within which to contest whether the facts found
constitute a violation of sections 62J.4981 and 62J.4982, according to the contested case and
judicial review provisions of sections 14.57 to 14.69.
    (b) If the commissioner has reason to believe that a violation of section 62J.4981 or 62J.4982
has occurred or is likely, the commissioner may confer with the persons involved before
commencing action under subdivision 2. The commissioner may notify the health information
exchange service provider and the representatives, or other persons who appear to be involved
in the suspected violation, to arrange a voluntary conference with the alleged violators or their
authorized representatives. The purpose of the conference is to attempt to learn the facts about the
suspected violation and, if it appears that a violation has occurred or is threatened, to find a way to
correct or prevent it. The conference is not governed by any formal procedural requirements, and
may be conducted as the commissioner considers appropriate.
   (c) The commissioner may issue an order directing a health information exchange service
provider or a representative of a health information exchange service provider to cease and desist
from engaging in any act or practice in violation of sections 62J.4981 and 62J.4982.
    (d) Within 20 days after service of the order to cease and desist, a health information exchange
service provider may contest whether the facts found constitute a violation of sections 62J.4981 and
62J.4982 according to the contested case and judicial review provisions of sections 14.57 to 14.69.
    (e) In the event of noncompliance with a cease and desist order issued under this subdivision,
the commissioner may institute a proceeding to obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief
in Ramsey County District Court.
   Subd. 2. Suspension or revocation of certificates of authority. (a) The commissioner may
suspend or revoke a certificate of authority issued to a health data intermediary or health information
organization under section 62J.4981 if the commissioner finds that:
    (1) the health information exchange service provider is operating significantly in contravention
of its basic organizational document, or in a manner contrary to that described in and reasonably
inferred from any other information submitted under section 62J.4981, unless amendments to the
submissions have been filed with and approved by the commissioner;
100TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 8, 2010                                       10743

   (2) the health information exchange service provider is unable to fulfill its obligations to furnish
comprehensive health information exchange services as required under its health information
exchange contract;
    (3) the health information exchange service provider is no longer financially solvent or may not
reasonably be expected to meet its obligations to participating entities;
    (4) the health information exchange service provider has failed to implement the complaint
system in a manner designed to reasonably resolve valid complaints;
   (5) the health information exchange service provider, or any person acting with its sanction, has
advertised or merchandised its services in an untrue, misleading, deceptive, or unfair manner;
   (6) the continued operation of the health information exchange service provider would be
hazardous to its participating entities or the patients served by the participating entities; or
    (7) the health information exchange service provider has otherwise failed to substantially
comply with section 62J.4981 or with any other statute or administrative rule applicable to health
information exchange service providers, or has submitted false information in any report required
under sections 62J.498 to 62J.4982.
    (b) A certificate of authority shall be suspended or revoked only after meeting the requirements
of subdivision 3.
    (c) If the certificate of authority of a health information exchange service provider is suspended,
the health information exchange service provider shall not, during the period of suspension, enroll
any additional participating entities, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation.
    (d) If the certificate of authority of a health information exchange service provider is
revoked, the organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of the order of
revocation, to wind up its affairs, and shall conduct no further business except as necessary to the
orderly conclusion of the affairs of the organization. The organization shall engage in no further
advertising or solicitation. The commissioner may, by written order, permit further operation of
the organization as the commissioner finds to be in the best interest of participating entities, to the
end that participating entities will be given the greatest practical opportunity to access continuing
health information exchange services.
    Subd. 3. Denial, suspension, and revocation; administrative procedures. (a) When the
commissioner has cause to believe that grounds for the denial, suspension, or revocation of a
certificate of authority exist, the commissioner shall notify the health information exchange service
provider in writing stating the grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation and setting a time
within 20 days for a hearing on the matter.
    (b) After a hearing before the commissioner at which the health information exchange service
provider may respond to the grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation, or upon the failure of the
health information exchange service provider to appear at the hearing, the commissioner shall take
action as deemed necessary and shall issue written findings and mail them to the health information
exchange service provider.
    (c) If suspension, revocation, or administrative penalty is proposed according to this section,
the commissioner must deliver, or send by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the health
10744                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [100TH DAY

is proposed;
   (3) the nature and amount of the proposed penalty;
    (4) any circumstances described in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), that were considered in
determining the amount of the proposed penalty;
   (5) instructions for responding to the notice, including a statement of the health information
exchange service provider's right to a contested case proceeding and a statement that failure to
request a contested case proceeding within 30 calendar days permits the imposition of the proposed
penalty; and
   (6) the address to which the contested case proceeding request must be sent.
   Subd. 4. Coordination. (a) The commissioner shall, to the extent possible, seek the advice of the
Minnesota e-Health Advisory Committee, in the review and update of criteria for the certification
and recertification of health information exchange service providers when implementing sections
62J.498 to 62J.4982.
    (b) By January 1, 2011, the commissioner shall report to the governor and the chairs of the senate
and house of representatives committees having jurisdiction over health information policy issues
on the status of health information exchange in Minnesota, and provide recommendations on further
action necessary to facilitate the secure electronic movement of health information among health
providers that will enable Minnesota providers and hospitals to meet meaningful use exchange
requirements.
    Subd. 5. Fees and monetary penalties. (a) The commissioner shall assess fees on every health
information exchange service provider subject to sections 62J.4981 and 62J.4982 as follows:
   (1) filing an application for certificate of authority to operate as a health information organization,
$10,500;
   (2) filing an application for certificate of authority to operate as a health data intermediary,
$7,000;
   (3) annual health information organization certificate fee, $14,000;
   (4) annual health data intermediary certificate fee, $7,000; and

applications are made through an open process that provides health information exchange service
providers equal opportunity to receive funding.
   Sec. 10. NONSUBMISSION OF HEALTH CARE CLAIM BY CLEARINGHOUSE;
SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION.
    A situation shall be considered a significant disruption to normal operations that materially
affects the provider's or facility's ability to conduct business in a normal manner and to submit

    (e) Whenever the liability is $120,000 or more separately for (1) the tax imposed under chapter
297A, (2) a fee that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes,
or (3) any other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A
taxes, then the payment of all the liabilities on the return must be accelerated as provided in this
subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes due and payable after September 1,

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 289A.60, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 31. Accelerated payment of monthly sales tax liability; penalty for underpayment.
For payments made after September 1, 2010, if a vendor is required by section 289A.20, subdivision
4, to remit a 90 percent payment by the 14th of the month following the month in which the taxable
event occurred, as an estimation of monthly sales tax liabilities, including the liability of any fee or
other tax that is to be reported on the same return as and paid with the chapter 297A taxes, for the
month in which the taxable event occurred, the vendor shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent of the
amount of liability that was required to be paid by the 14th of the month less the amount remitted
by the 14th of the month. The penalty must not be imposed, however, if the amount remitted by the
14th of the month equals the lesser of 90 percent of the liability for the month preceding the month
in which the taxable event occurred or 90 percent of the average monthly liability for the previous
calendar year.

the county was certified to receive in 2009, plus the amount of taconite aids under sections 298.28
and 298.282 that the county was certified to receive in 2009, including any amounts required to be
placed in a special fund for distribution in a later year.
    (c) "Population" means the population of the county for 2007 based on information available to
