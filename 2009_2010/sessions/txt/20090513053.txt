      Sec. 4. [135A.26] AMERICAN MADE CLOTHING IN COLLEGE BOOKSTORES.
    To the extent possible, a bookstore located on the campus of a public college or university in

States of America. The college or university must make a report to the legislature on the results of
efforts made to comply with this section.
  Sec. 5. [135A.61] HIGH SCHOOL-TO-COLLEGE DEVELOPMENTAL TRANSITION
PROGRAMS.
    Subdivision 1. High school-to-college developmental transition programs. All public higher
education systems and other higher education institutions in Minnesota are encouraged to offer
research-based high school-to-college developmental transition programs to prepare students for
college-level academic coursework. A program under this section must, at a minimum, include
instruction to develop the skills and abilities necessary to be ready for college-level coursework
when the student enrolls in a degree, diploma, or certificate program and must address the academic
skills identified as needing improvement by a college readiness assessment completed by the student.
A program offered under this section must not constitute more than the equivalent of one semester of
full-time study occurring in the summer following high school graduation. The courses completed
in a program under this section must be identified on the student's transcript with a unique identifier
to distinguish it from other developmental education courses or programs.
    Subd. 2. High school-to-college developmental transition programs evaluation report.
(a) Institutions that offer a high school-to-college developmental transition program and enroll
students that receive a grant under section 136A.121, subdivision 9b, must annually submit data
and information about the services provided and program outcomes to the director of the Office
of Higher Education.
    (b) The director must establish and convene a data working group to develop: (1) the data
methodology to be used in evaluating the effectiveness of the programs implemented to improve

1965, and any amendments thereof, and any other law which provides funds for higher education
and requires administration by a state higher education agency as enacted or may be enacted by
the Congress of the United States; provided that no commitment shall be made that shall bind
the legislature to make appropriations beyond current allocations of funds. The office may apply
for, receive, accept, and disburse all administrative funds available to the office for administering
federal funds to support higher education programs, construction, or other activities. The office also
may apply for, receive, accept, and disburse any research, planning, or program funds which are

administering federal funds the office may comply with any and all requirements of federal law
and federal rules and regulations to enable it to receive and accept such funds. The expenditure
of any such funds received shall be governed by the laws of the state, except insofar as federal
regulations may otherwise provide. The office may contract with both public and private institutions
in administering federal funds, and such contracts shall not be subject to the provisions of chapter
16C. All such money received by the office shall be deposited in the state treasury and, subject
to section 3.3005, are hereby appropriated to it annually for the purpose for which such funds are

student from a low-income family are covered by state financial aid when combined with federal
and other sources of aid.
   Subd. 2. Informational materials. The Office of Higher Education must prepare and distribute

illness, while under the care of a medical professional, that substantially limits the student's ability
to complete the term is entitled to an additional semester or the equivalent of grant eligibility. A

for ten hours per week during a summer term. The office must determine an amount for student
earnings in a summer term, using available data about earnings, before determining the amount
awarded under this subdivision.
    (b) For a student with an expected family contribution of zero, the maximum amount of the grant
is the cost of attendance under subdivision 6.
   (c) A grant under this subdivision counts as one of the nine semesters of eligibility under
subdivision 9. A grant under this subdivision must not be awarded for the same term for which
another grant is awarded under this section.

to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.
    (b) If an action is brought under this section, no other person may bring another action under
this section based on the same facts that are the subject of the pending action.
   (c) An action may not be maintained under this section:
    (1) against the state, the legislature, the judiciary, the executive branch, or a political subdivision,
or their respective officers, members, or employees;
    (2) if the action is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil action or
an administrative proceeding for a monetary penalty to which the state or a political subdivision is
already a party; or
     (3) unless the action is brought by an original source of the information or the prosecuting
attorney initiates or intervenes in the action, if the action is based upon the public disclosure of
allegations or transactions: (i) in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; (ii) in an investigation,
report, hearing, or audit conducted by or at the request of the house of representatives or the senate;
(iii) by an auditor or the governing body of a political subdivision; or (iv) by the news media.
    (d) A complaint in an action under this section must be commenced by filing the complaint with
the court in chambers and the court must place it under seal for at least 60 days. No service may be
made upon the defendant until the complaint is unsealed.
    (e) If a complaint is filed under this section, the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint on
the prosecuting attorney in accordance with the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure and at the same
time shall serve a written disclosure of all material evidence and information the plaintiff possesses.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
  Sec. 29. [15C.06] PROSECUTING ATTORNEY INTERVENTION; MOTION TO
EXTEND TIME; UNSEALING OF COMPLAINT.
    (a) Within 60 days after receiving a complaint and disclosure under section 15C.05, the
prosecuting attorney shall intervene or decline intervention or, for good cause shown, move
the court to extend the time for doing so. The motion may be supported by affidavits or other
submissions in chambers.
    (b) The complaint must be unsealed after the prosecuting attorney decides whether or not to
intervene.
   (c) Notwithstanding the prosecuting attorney's decision regarding intervention in an action
brought by a plaintiff under section 15C.05, the prosecuting attorney may pursue the claim through
any alternate remedy available to the state, including an administrative proceeding to determine
a civil monetary penalty. If the prosecuting attorney pursues an alternate remedy in another

proceeding, the person initiating the action has the same rights in that proceeding as if the action
had continued under section 15C.05. A finding of fact or conclusion of law made in the other
proceeding that has become final is conclusive on all parties to an action under section 15C.05.
For purposes of this paragraph, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on
appeal to the appropriate state court, if the time for filing an appeal has expired, or if the finding or
conclusion is not subject to judicial review.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
  Sec. 30. [15C.07] SERVICE OF UNSEALED COMPLAINT AND RESPONSE BY
DEFENDANT.
    When unsealed, the complaint must be served on the defendant pursuant to Rule 3 of the
Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendant must respond to the complaint within 20 days
after it is served on the defendant.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 31. [15C.08] PROSECUTING ATTORNEY AND PRIVATE PARTY ROLES.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, if the prosecuting attorney does not intervene
at the outset in an action brought by a person under section 15C.05, the person has the same rights
in conducting the action as the prosecuting attorney would have. A copy of each pleading or other
paper filed in the action and a copy of the transcript of each deposition taken must be mailed to the
prosecuting attorney if the prosecuting attorney so requests and pays the cost of doing so.
    (b) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to intervene at the outset of the action, the prosecuting
attorney may intervene subsequently, upon timely application and good cause shown. If the
prosecuting attorney so intervenes, the prosecuting attorney subsequently has primary responsibility
for conducting the action.
    (c) If the prosecuting attorney elects at the outset of the action to intervene, the prosecuting
attorney has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action. The person who initially brought
the action remains a party but the person's acts do not bind the prosecuting attorney.
     (d) Whether or not the prosecuting attorney intervenes in the action, the prosecuting attorney may
move to dismiss the action for good cause. The person who brought the action must be notified of the
filing of the motion and may oppose it and present evidence at the hearing. The prosecuting attorney
may also settle the action. If the prosecuting attorney intends to settle the action, the prosecuting
attorney shall notify the person who brought the action. The state or the political subdivision may
settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action
if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable
under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, the hearing may be held in chambers.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 32. [15C.09] STAY OF DISCOVERY; EXTENSION.
   (a) The court may stay discovery by a person who brought an action under section 15C.05 for not
more than 60 days if the prosecuting attorney shows that the proposed discovery would interfere
with the investigation or prosecution of a civil or criminal matter arising out of the same facts,
53RD DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                          5307

whether or not the prosecuting attorney participates in the action.
   (b) The court may extend the stay upon a further showing that the prosecuting attorney has
pursued the civil or criminal investigation or proceeding with reasonable diligence and that the
proposed discovery would interfere with its continuation. Discovery may not be stayed for a total
of more than six months over the objection of the person who brought the action, except for good
cause shown by the prosecuting attorney.
   (c) A showing made pursuant to this section must be made in chambers.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
  Sec. 33. [15C.10] COURT-IMPOSED LIMITATION UPON PARTICIPATION OF
PRIVATE PLAINTIFF IN ACTION.
    Upon a showing by the prosecuting attorney in an action in which the prosecuting attorney has
intervened that unrestricted participation by a person under this chapter would interfere with or
unduly delay the conduct of the action, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or solely for harassment,
the court may limit the person's participation by limiting the number of witnesses, the length of the
testimony of the witnesses, the cross-examination of witnesses by the person, or by other measures.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 34. [15C.11] LIMITATION OF ACTIONS; REMEDIES.
    (a) An action under this chapter may not be commenced more than three years after the date
of discovery of the fraudulent activity by the prosecuting attorney or more than six years after the
fraudulent activity occurred, whichever occurs later, but in no event more than ten years after the
date on which the violation is committed.
    (b) A finding of guilt in a criminal proceeding charging a false statement or fraud, whether upon
a verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, stops the person found guilty from denying
an essential element of that offense in an action under this chapter based upon the same transaction
as the criminal proceeding.
    (c) In an action under this chapter, the state or the political subdivision and any plaintiff under
section 15C.05 must prove the essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a
preponderance of the evidence.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 35. [15C.12] AWARD OF EXPENSES AND ATTORNEY FEES.
    If the prosecuting attorney or a person who brought an action under section 15C.05 prevails in
or settles an action under this chapter, the court may authorize the prosecuting attorney or person
to recover reasonable costs, reasonable attorney fees, and the reasonable fees of expert consultants
and expert witnesses. These expenses must be awarded against the defendant and are not allowed
against the state or a political subdivision. If the prosecuting attorney does not intervene in the action
and the person bringing the action conducts the action and the defendant prevails in the action, the
court shall award to the defendant reasonable expenses and attorney fees against the person bringing
the action if it finds that the action was clearly frivolous or vexatious or brought in substantial part
for harassment. The state or a political subdivision is not liable for expenses, attorney fees, or other
5308                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [53RD DAY

costs incurred by a person in bringing or defending an action under this chapter.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 36. [15C.13] DISTRIBUTION TO PRIVATE PLAINTIFF IN CERTAIN ACTIONS.
    If the prosecuting attorney intervenes at the outset in an action brought by a person under section
15C.05, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or more than 25 percent of any
recovery in proportion to the person's contribution to the conduct of the action. If the prosecuting
attorney does not intervene in the action at any time, the person is entitled to receive not less than
25 percent or more than 30 percent of any recovery of the civil penalty and damages, or settlement,
as the court determines is reasonable. If the prosecuting attorney does not intervene in the action at
the outset but subsequently intervenes, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or
more than 30 percent of any recovery, as the court determines is reasonable based on the person's
participation in the action before the prosecuting attorney intervened.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 37. [15C.14] EMPLOYER RESTRICTIONS; LIABILITY.
    (a) An employer must not adopt or enforce any rule or policy forbidding an employee to disclose
information to the state, a political subdivision, or a law enforcement agency, or to act in furtherance
of an action under this chapter, including investigation for, bringing, or testifying in the action.
    (b) An employer must not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, deny promotion to, or
otherwise discriminate against an employee in the terms or conditions of employment because of
lawful acts done by the employee on the employee's behalf or on behalf of others in disclosing
information to the state, a political subdivision, or a law enforcement agency in furtherance of an
action under this chapter, including investigation for bringing or testifying in the action.
    (c) An employer who violates this section is liable to the affected employee in a civil action for
damages and other relief, including reinstatement, twice the amount of lost compensation, interest
on the lost compensation, any special damage sustained as a result of the discrimination, and punitive
damages if appropriate. The employer is also liable for expenses recoverable under section 15C.12,
including costs and attorney fees.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010.
   Sec. 38. [15C.15] DEPOSIT OF STATE FUNDS; FALSE CLAIMS ACCOUNT.
   Subdivision 1. Deposit of funds. The net proceeds received by the state in an action under this
chapter, after distributions made to private plaintiffs and as otherwise required by federal law, must
be deposited in the state treasury and credited as follows:
   (1) the portion of net proceeds equal to the amount of the actual damages that the state sustains
because of an act specified in section 15C.02 must be credited to the fund that sustained the damages;
    (2) the portion of net proceeds equal to the additional recovery of federal money authorized by
United States Code, title 42, section 1396h, for a recovery under this chapter, as determined by the
commissioner of finance, must be credited to the false claims account under subdivision 2, provided
that the amount credited may not exceed $1,000,000 in a fiscal year; and
53RD DAY]                            WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                      5309

      (3) the remainder of the net proceeds must be credited to the general fund.
    Subd. 2. False claims account. A false claims account is established in the special revenue
fund in the state treasury. The commissioner of finance may enter into interagency agreements to
deposit up to $2,055,000 for litigation and related expenses under this act. Money in the account
deposited through interagency agreement or under subdivision 1 is annually appropriated to the
attorney general for purposes of this chapter.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. Subdivision 2 is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 39. [15C.16] REPORTING.
   The attorney general shall report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and
house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over state government finance by January 15
each year, on activities under this chapter during the prior calendar year. The report must include:
      (1) the number of complaints received by the attorney general under section 15C.05;

   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 16A.151, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Exceptions. (a) If a state official litigates or settles a matter on behalf of specific injured
persons or entities, this section does not prohibit distribution of money to the specific injured persons
or entities on whose behalf the litigation or settlement efforts were initiated. If money recovered on
behalf of injured persons or entities cannot reasonably be distributed to those persons or entities
because they cannot readily be located or identified or because the cost of distributing the money
would outweigh the benefit to the persons or entities, the money must be paid into the general fund.
   (b) Money recovered on behalf of a fund in the state treasury other than the general fund may
be deposited in that fund.
   (c) This section does not prohibit a state official from distributing money to a person or entity
other than the state in litigation or potential litigation in which the state is a defendant or potential
defendant.
    (d) State agencies may accept funds as directed by a federal court for any restitution or monetary
penalty under United States Code, title 18, section 3663(a)(3) or United States Code, title 18, section
3663A(a)(3). Funds received must be deposited in a special revenue account and are appropriated
to the commissioner of the agency for the purpose as directed by the federal court.

    Subd. 8. Report on budget reserve percentage. (a) The commissioner of finance must
periodically review the formula developed as part of the Budget Trends Study Commission
authorized by Laws 2007, chapter 148, article 2, section 81, to estimate the percentage of the
preceding biennium's general fund expenditures and transfers recommended as a budget reserve.
    (b) The commissioner must annually review the variables and coefficients in the formula used
to model the base of the general fund taxes and the mix of taxes that provide revenues to the general
fund. If the commissioner determines that the variables and coefficients have changed enough
to result in a change in the percentage of the preceding biennium's general fund expenditures
and transfers recommended as a budget reserve, the commissioner must update the variables and
coefficients in the formula to reflect the current base and mix of general fund taxes.
    (c) Every ten years, the commissioner must review the methodology underlying the formula,
taking into consideration relevant economic literature from the past ten years, and determine if the
formula remains adequate as a tool for estimating the percentage of the preceding biennium's general
fund expenditures and transfers recommended as a budget reserve. If the commissioner determines
that the methodology underlying the formula is outdated, the commissioner must revise the formula.
   (d) By January 15 of each year, the commissioner must report to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives Committee on Ways and Means and the senate Committee
on Finance, in compliance with sections 3.195 and 3.197, on the percentage of the preceding
biennium's general fund expenditures and transfers recommended as a budget reserve. The report
must specify:

   (1) if the commissioner updated the variables and coefficients in the formula to reflect significant
changes to either the base of one or more general fund taxes or to the mix of taxes that provide
revenues to the general fund as provided in paragraph (b);
   (2) if the commissioner revised the formula after determining the methodology was outdated as
provided in paragraph (c); and
   (3) if the percentage of the preceding biennium's general fund expenditures and transfers
recommended as a budget reserve has changed as a result of an update of or a revision to the
formula.

new lease-purchase agreement and issue and sell certificates of participation for the purpose of
refunding any lease-purchase agreement and related certificates of participation then outstanding,
including the payment of any redemption premiums, any interest accrued or that is to accrue to
the redemption date, and costs related to the issuance and sale of such refunding certificates. The
proceeds of any refunding certificates may, in the discretion of the commissioner, be applied to the
purchase or payment at maturity of the certificates to be refunded, to the redemption of outstanding
lease-purchase agreements and certificates on any redemption date, or to pay interest on the
refunding lease-purchase agreements and certificates and may, pending such application, be placed
in escrow to be applied to such purchase, payment, retirement, or redemption. Any escrowed
proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized

may also be applied to the payment of the lease-purchase agreements and certificates to be refunded,
interest or premiums on the refunded certificates, or to pay interest on the refunding lease-purchase
agreements and certificates. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance
of proceeds and any investment income may be returned to the general fund, or if applicable, the
technology lease project fund, for use in a lawful manner. All refunding lease-purchase agreements
and certificates issued under the provisions of this subdivision must be prepared, executed,
delivered, and secured by appropriations in the same manner as the lease-purchase agreements and

    (b) The purpose of this designation is to facilitate the transition of veterans from military to

sacrifice of health and time, to the state and nation during their military service, as well as to enhance
economic development within Minnesota.
   (c) For purposes of this section and section 16C.19, "service-connected disability" has the

                            r a small business located in an economically disadvantaged area, or a

   Sec. 59. [16E.22] STATEWIDE ELECTRONIC LICENSING SYSTEM.
    Subdivision 1. Account established; appropriation. The statewide electronic licensing account
is created in the special revenue fund. Receipts and transfers credited to the account are appropriated
to the state chief information officer for completion of the Minnesota electronic licensing system,
for transferring licensing agencies to the system, and for operation and maintenance of the system
during the completion and transfer period.
    Subd. 2. Requirements. The transfer of an existing electronic licensing system to the Minnesota
electronic licensing system may not reduce the critical functionality provided by the existing system.
   Subd. 3. Temporary licensing surcharge. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, executive
53RD DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                        5323

branch state agencies shall collect a temporary surcharge of ten percent of the licensing fee, but no
less than $5 and no more than $150 on each business, commercial, professional, or occupational
license that:
   (1) requires a fee; and
    (2) will be transferred to the Minnesota electronic licensing system, as determined by the state
chief information officer.
The surcharge applies to initial license applications and license renewals. Each agency that issues
a license subject to this subdivision shall collect the surcharge for the license for up to six years
between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2015, as directed by the state chief information officer. Receipts
from the surcharge shall be deposited in the statewide licensing account established in subdivision
1.
    (b) An agency may transfer an amount equivalent to the surcharge imposed under this section
from existing license accounts to the statewide electronic licensing system account in lieu of
collecting the surcharge required under this section. If a transfer is made under this subdivision
or under section 45.24, the temporary surcharge required under paragraph (a) does not apply to
the relevant license. Transfers received under this paragraph shall be deposited in the statewide
licensing account established in subdivision 1.
    (c) In lieu of collecting the surcharge imposed in paragraph (a), during each fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2009, and ending June 30, 2015, one or more health-related boards established in chapter 214
may transfer funds from the health occupations licensing account in the state government special
revenue fund to the statewide electronic licensing system account to meet the requirements under
paragraph (b). If the commissioner of finance determines that the balance of the health occupations
licensing account established in section 214.06, subdivision 1a, is insufficient to make transfers
under paragraph (b), then the temporary surcharge required under paragraph (a) must be applied to
the relevant licenses.
    (d) Department of Commerce licensees who are paying for an existing electronic licensing
database system under section 45.24 must not be required to pay the surcharge under this section.
    Subd. 4. Contract authority. The state chief information officer may enter into a risk-share
or phased agreement with a vendor to complete the Minnesota electronic licensing system and
to transfer licensing agencies to the system, provided that the payment for the vendor's services
under the agreement is limited to the revenue from the surcharge enacted under subdivision 3, after
payment of state operating and maintenance costs. The agreement must clearly indicate that the state
chief information officer may only expend amounts actually collected from the surcharge, after state
operations and maintenance costs have been paid, in payment for the vendor's services and that the
vendor assumes this risk when performing work under the contract. This section does not require
the state chief information officer to pay the vendor the entire amount of the surcharge revenue that
remains after payment of state operations and maintenance costs. Before entering into a contract
under this subdivision, the state chief information officer must consult with the commissioner of
finance regarding the implementation of the surcharge and the terms of the contract.
   Subd. 5. Unused funds. Money remaining in the statewide electronic licensing account after
payment of all costs of completing the Minnesota electronic licensing system, transferring licensing
agencies to the system, and operating and maintaining the system during the completion and transfer
5324                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                        [53RD DAY

period is appropriated to the state chief information officer for the costs of operating and maintaining
the Minnesota electronic licensing system after the system has been completed.
    Subd. 6. Priority. To the extent possible, in completing the Minnesota electronic licensing
system, the state chief information officer must give priority to licenses that are not issued
electronically. Licenses regulated by a health board under chapter 214 must not be transferred to
the Minnesota electronic licensing system before July 1, 2011.
    Subd. 7. Expiration. This section expires on June 30, 2017.
    Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 31.60, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

    Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 43A.1815, is amended to read:
    43A.1815 VACATION DONATION TO SICK LEAVE ACCOUNT.
    (a) In addition to donations under section 43A.181, a state employee may donate a total of up to
­2
1 ­ 40 hours of accrued vacation leave each fiscal year to the sick leave account of one or more state
employees. A state employee may not be paid for more than 80 hours in a payroll period during
which the employee uses sick leave credited to the employee's account as a result of a transfer from
another state employee's vacation account.
    (b) The recipient employee must receive donations, as available, for a life-threatening condition
of the employee or spouse or dependent child that prevents the employee from working. A recipient
may use program donations retroactively to when all forms of paid leave are exhausted if the
employee has sufficient donations to cover the period of retroactivity.
    (c) An applicant for benefits under this section who receives an unfavorable determination may
select a designee to consult with the commissioner or commissioner's designee on the reasons for
the determination.
    (d) The commissioner shall establish procedures under section 43A.04, subdivision 4, for
eligibility, duration of need based on individual cases, monitoring and evaluation of individual

   Sec. 62. [43A.184] SICK LEAVE FOR VETERANS WITH SERVICE-RELATED
DISABILITIES.
    On a form prescribed by the commissioner, a state employee who is a veteran with a
service-related disability may apply to the employee's appointing authority for additional sick leave
to receive treatment for the disability, as provided in this section. The employee must qualify as a
veteran under section 197.447, and have a sick leave balance that is insufficient to receive treatment
for the disability. If the appointing authority approves the request, the appointing authority shall

authority may approve sick leave for an employee under this section one time in each fiscal year.
    Sec. 63. [43A.325] BEST PRACTICES FOR INVESTIGATIONS.
    The commissioner of finance must develop and make available to appointing authorities in
the executive branch a best practices policy for conducting investigations in which the appointing
authority compels its employees to answer questions about allegedly inappropriate activity. The
best practices policy must be designed to facilitate effective investigations, without compromising
the ability to prosecute criminal cases when appropriate. Each appointing authority must follow the
best practices policy or, in consultation with the attorney general, must develop its own policy for
conducting these investigations.
    Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 43A.49, is amended to read:

must make the employer contribution. If the leave of absence is for one full pay period or longer,
any holiday pay shall be included in the first payroll warrant after return from the leave of absence.
The appointing authority shall attempt to grant requests for the unpaid leaves of absence consistent
with the need to continue efficient operation of the agency. However, each appointing authority shall

employee contribution for the period of the leave under this section, the appointing authority must
pay the employer contribution. The appointing authority may, at its discretion, pay the employee
contributions. Contributions must be made in a time and manner prescribed by the executive director

    Subd. 3. Reimbursements. Except as specifically provided otherwise, each agency shall
reimburse the management analysis revolving fund for the cost of all services, supplies, materials,
labor, and depreciation of equipment, including reasonable overhead costs, that the commissioner
is authorized and directed to furnish an agency. The commissioner shall report the rates to be
charged for the revolving fund no later than July 1 of each year to the chair of the committee or
division of the senate or the house of representatives with primary jurisdiction over the budget of
the Department of Finance.
    Subd. 4. Cash flow. The commissioner may make appropriate transfers to the revolving
fund according to section 16A.126. The commissioner may make allotment and encumbrances
in anticipation of these transfers. In addition, the commissioner may require an agency to make
advance payments to the revolving fund sufficient to cover the office's estimated obligation for
a period of at least 60 days. All reimbursements and other money received by the commissioner
under this section must be deposited in the management analysis revolving fund.
    Subd. 5. Liquidation. If the management analysis revolving fund is abolished or liquidated, the
total net profit from the operation of the fund must be distributed to the various funds from which
purchases were made. For a given period of time, the amount of total net profit to be distributed to
each fund shall reflect the same ratio of total purchases attributable to each fund divided by the total
purchases from all funds.

revenue fund.
    (e) The commissioner shall deposit the surcharge permitted under this section in the account

determined by the commissioner of commerce from the account to the statewide electronic licensing
system account under section 16E.22 for the costs of the statewide licensing system attributable to
the inclusion of licenses subject to this section.
    (f) The commissioner shall temporarily reduce or suspend the surcharge as necessary if the
balance in the account created in paragraph (d) exceeds $2,000,000 as of the end of any calendar year
and shall increase or decrease the surcharge as necessary to keep the fund balance at an adequate
level but not in excess of $2,000,000.

of the State Board of Investment and the various ambulance services, the Cooper/Sams volunteer
ambulance program must be administered by the Emergency Medical Services Regulatory Board.
The administrative responsibilities of the board for the program relate solely to the record keeping,

documentation of a year of prior service, and for submission of all necessary data to the board in a
manner consistent with this chapter. Determinations of an ambulance service are final.

retain a qualified governmental or nongovernmental plan administrator under contract to administer
those responsibilities regarding the program. A contract with a qualified plan administrator must be
the result of an open competitive bidding process and must be reopened for competitive bidding at
least once during every five-year period after July 1, 1993.

for granting waivers from the subcontracting requirement when qualified small targeted group
businesses and veteran-owned small businesses are not reasonably available. The commissioner
may establish financial incentives for prime contractors who exceed the goals for use of
subcontractors and financial penalties for prime contractors who fail to meet goals under this

targeted group businesses must be performed by the business to which the subcontract is awarded or
another small targeted group business. At least 75 percent of subcontracts awarded to veteran-owned
small businesses must be performed by the business to which the subcontract is awarded or another
veteran-owned small business.
   Subd. 4. Awards, limitations. Contracts awarded pursuant to this section are subject to all
limitations contained in rules adopted by the commissioner of administration.

                     R--P

     (a) Subject to subsection (b):
   (1) in each calendar year following the calendar year in which a limited partnership becomes
subject to this chapter, the limited partnership must deliver to the secretary of state for filing an
       r­
annual ­eg­­s t­­
           i­­r a­i
                 t­o ­ renewal containing the information required by subsection (c); and
                    ­n
    (2) in each calendar year following the calendar year in which there is first on file with the
secretary of state a certificate of authority under section 321.0904 pertaining to a foreign limited
partnership, the foreign limited partnership must deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual
r­
­eg
  ­­s t­­
   i­­r a­i
         t­o­­
             n renewal containing the information required by subsection (c).
    (b) A limited partnership's obligation under subsection (a) ends if the limited partnership
delivers to the secretary of state for filing a statement of termination under section 321.0203 and
the statement becomes effective under section 321.0206. A foreign limited partnership's obligation
under subsection (a) ends if the secretary of state issues and files a certificate of revocation under
section 321.0906 or if the foreign limited partnership delivers to the secretary of state for filing
a notice of cancellation under section 321.0907(a) and that notice takes effect under section
321.0206. If a foreign limited partnership's obligations under subsection (a) end and later the
secretary of state files, pursuant to section 321.0904, a new certificate of authority pertaining to that
foreign limited partnership, subsection (a)(2), again applies to the foreign limited partnership and,
for the purposes of subsection (a)(2), the calendar year of the new filing is treated as the calendar
year in which a certificate of authority is first on file with the secretary of state.

    (11) the month and year in which the authority has received or anticipates it will receive the first
increment from the district;
   (12) the date the district must be decertified;

   Subd. 15. Cooperative purchasing. (a) Municipalities may contract for the purchase of
supplies, materials, or equipment by utilizing contracts that are available through the state's
cooperative purchasing venture authorized by section 16C.11 . For a contract estimated to exceed
$25,000, a municipality must consider the availability, price and quality of supplies, materials, or
equipment available through the state's cooperative purchasing venture before purchasing through
another source.
   (b) If a municipality does not utilize the state's cooperative purchasing venture, a municipality
may contract for the purchase of supplies, materials, or equipment without regard to the competitive
bidding requirements of this section if the purchase is through a national municipal association's
purchasing alliance or cooperative created by a joint powers agreement that purchases items from
more than one source on the basis of competitive bids or competitive quotations.
     Sec. 93. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 473.142, is amended to read:

group businesses are likely to bid. The council and each agency specified in section 473.143,

three veteran-owned small businesses are likely to bid.
    (c) The council and each agency specified in section 473.143, subdivision 1, as a condition
of awarding a construction contract or approving a contract for consultant, professional, or
technical services, may set goals that require the prime contractor to subcontract a portion of the
contract to small targeted group businesses and veteran-owned small businesses designated under
section 16C.16. The council or agency must establish a procedure for granting waivers from the
subcontracting requirement when qualified small targeted group businesses and veteran-owned
small businesses are not reasonably available. The council or agency may establish financial
incentives for prime contractors who exceed the goals for use of subcontractors and financial
penalties for prime contractors who fail to meet goals under this paragraph. The subcontracting
requirements of this paragraph do not apply to prime contractors who are small targeted group
businesses and veteran-owned small businesses. At least 75 percent of the value of the subcontracts
awarded to small targeted group businesses under this paragraph must be performed by the
business to which the subcontract is awarded or by another small targeted group business. At least
75 percent of the value of the subcontracts awarded to veteran-owned small businesses under
this paragraph must be performed by the business to which the subcontract is awarded or another
veteran-owned small business.

purchase from small targeted group businesses and veteran-owned small businesses designated
under section 16C.16 when making purchases that are not subject to competitive bidding
procedures.
   (e) The council and each agency may adopt rules to implement this section.
    (f) Each council or agency contract must require the prime contractor to pay any subcontractor
within ten days of the prime contractor's receipt of payment from the council or agency for
undisputed services provided by the subcontractor. The contract must require the prime contractor
to pay interest of 1-1/2 percent per month or any part of a month to the subcontractor on any
undisputed amount not paid on time to the subcontractor. The minimum monthly interest penalty
payment for an unpaid balance of $100 or more is $10. For an unpaid balance of less than $100,
the prime contractor shall pay the actual penalty due to the subcontractor. A subcontractor who
prevails in a civil action to collect interest penalties from a prime contractor must be awarded its
costs and disbursements, including attorney fees, incurred in bringing the action.
    (g) This section does not apply to procurement financed in whole or in part with federal funds
if the procurement is subject to federal disadvantaged, minority, or women business enterprise
regulations. The council and each agency shall report to the commissioner of administration on
compliance with this section. The information must be reported at the time and in the manner
requested by the commissioner.

    Employees who make an election under clause (1) remain on the county payroll, but the

Counties are eligible for grants to the extent that they decide to purchase ballot marking machines
and as a result do not have sufficient Help America Vote Act grant money remaining to also purchase
a compatible precinct-based optical scan machine or central-count machine. These grants must be
allocated to counties at a rate of $3,000 per eligible precinct until the appropriation is exhausted,

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216A.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6a. Hearing reporter. The commission may delegate to the executive secretary authority

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Suspension of proposed rate; hearing; final determination defined. (a) Whenever
there is filed with the commission a schedule modifying or resulting in a change in any rates then
in force as provided in subdivision 1, the commission may suspend the operation of the schedule
by filing with the schedule of rates and delivering to the affected utility a statement in writing of
its reasons for the suspension at any time before the rates become effective. The suspension shall
not be for a longer period than ten months beyond the initial filing date except as provided in this
subdivision or subdivision 1a.
    (b) During the suspension the commission shall determine whether all questions of the
reasonableness of the rates requested raised by persons deemed interested or by the department can
be resolved to the satisfaction of the commission. If the commission finds that all significant issues
raised have not been resolved to its satisfaction, or upon petition by ten percent of the affected
customers or 250 affected customers, whichever is less, it shall refer the matter to the Office of
Administrative Hearings with instructions for a public hearing as a contested case pursuant to
chapter 14, except as otherwise provided in this section.
    (c) The commission may order that the issues presented by the proposed rate changes be
bifurcated into two separate hearings as follows: (1) determination of the utility's revenue
requirements and (2) determination of the rate design. Upon issuance of both administrative law

commission.
   (d) All prehearing discovery activities of state agency intervenors shall be consolidated and
conducted by the Department of Commerce.
    (e) If the commission does not make a final determination concerning a schedule of rates within
ten months after the initial filing date, the schedule shall be deemed to have been approved by the
commission; except if:
    (1) an extension of the procedural schedule has been granted under paragraph (f) or subdivision
1a, in which case the schedule of rates is deemed to have been approved by the commission on the
last day of the extended period of suspension; or
    (2) a settlement has been submitted to and rejected by the commission and the commission does
not make a final determination concerning the schedule of rates, the schedule of rates is deemed to
have been approved 60 days after the initial or, if applicable, the extended period of suspension.

    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.16, subdivision 7b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7b. Transmission cost adjustment. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, the commission may approve a tariff mechanism for the automatic annual adjustment
of charges for the Minnesota jurisdictional costs of (i) new transmission facilities that have
been separately filed and reviewed and approved by the commission under section 216B.243 or
are certified as a priority project or deemed to be a priority transmission project under section
216B.2425; and (ii) charges incurred by a utility that accrue from other transmission owners'
regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the Midwest Independent
System Operator to benefit the utility, as provided for under a federally approved tariff.
  (b) Upon filing by a public utility or utilities providing transmission service, the commission
may approve, reject, or modify, after notice and comment, a tariff that:
   (1) allows the utility to recover on a timely basis the costs net of revenues of facilities approved
under section 216B.243 or certified or deemed to be certified under section 216B.2425 or exempt
from the requirements of section 216B.243;
    (2) allows the charges incurred by a utility that accrue from other transmission owners'
regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the Midwest Independent
System Operator to benefit the utility, as provided for under a federally approved tariff. These
charges must be reduced or offset by revenues received by the utility and by amounts the utility
charges to other regional transmission owners, to the extent those revenues and charges have not
been otherwise offset;
   (3) allows a return on investment at the level approved in the utility's last general rate case,
unless a different return is found to be consistent with the public interest;
    (4) provides a current return on construction work in progress, provided that recovery from
Minnesota retail customers for the allowance for funds used during construction is not sought
through any other mechanism;
   (5) allows for recovery of other expenses if shown to promote a least-cost project option or is
otherwise in the public interest;
    (6) allocates project costs appropriately between wholesale and retail customers;

    (7) provides a mechanism for recovery above cost, if necessary to improve the overall economics
of the project or projects or is otherwise in the public interest; and
    (8) terminates recovery once costs have been fully recovered or have otherwise been reflected
in the utility's general rates.
    (c) A public utility may file annual rate adjustments to be applied to customer bills paid under
the tariff approved in paragraph (b). In its filing, the public utility shall provide:
      (1) a description of and context for the facilities included for recovery;
      (2) a schedule for implementation of applicable projects;
      (3) the utility's costs for these projects;
      (4) a description of the utility's efforts to ensure the lowest costs to ratepayers for the project;
and
    (5) calculations to establish that the rate adjustment is consistent with the terms of the tariff
established in paragraph (b).
    (d) Upon receiving a filing for a rate adjustment pursuant to the tariff established in paragraph (b),
the commission shall approve the annual rate adjustments provided that, after notice and comment,
the costs included for recovery through the tariff were or are expected to be prudently incurred and
achieve transmission system improvements at the lowest feasible and prudent cost to ratepayers.

technology-assisted efficiency programs and devices; or
   (iii) are exploratory, experimental, or research facilities to advance the use of renewable energy,
conservation, electric vehicles, and advanced technology-assisted efficiency programs and devices;
   (2) that the utility has engaged in a cooperative process with affected local and state government
agencies in the design, planning, or construction of the Central Corridor utility zone project and
changes to utility facilities;
    (3) that the utility and local units of government have made reasonable efforts to seek federal,
state, or private funds that may be available to mass transit and energy projects;
   (4) that the utility has made reasonable efforts to minimize the project costs and maximize the
value of the facilities to customers;
   (5) that the utility has a plan to offer a comprehensive array of programs for residential,
commercial, and industrial customers located within the mass transit zone;
   (6) that the utility direct existing and planned solar energy programs to develop solar energy
along the mass transit utility zone; and
    (7) that the utility has made reasonable efforts to apply for federal funds to develop
technology-assisted efficiency programs and devices within the mass transit utility zone.
    (d) Upon request of the commission, the utility shall submit periodic reports to the commission
reviewing the cost and benefits of the facilities constructed within the Central Corridor utility zone
and their potential applicability to other areas outside the Central Corridor utility zone.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission may approve a tariff
mechanism for automatic adjustment of charges for new, replaced, or relocated facilities installed
under this subdivision in a manner consistent with this subdivision and the standards and procedures
contained in subdivision 7b, except that no approval under section 216B.243 or certification under
section 216B.2425 is required unless otherwise required by law. This section does not authorize a
city-requested facilities surcharge.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.1645, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Cost recovery for utility's renewable facilities. (a) A utility may petition the
commission to approve a rate schedule that provides for the automatic adjustment of charges to
recover prudently incurred investments, expenses, or costs associated with facilities constructed,
owned, or operated by a utility to satisfy the requirements of section 216B.1691, provided those
facilities were previously approved by the commission under section 216B.2422 or 216B.243,
or were determined by the commission to be reasonable and prudent under section 216B.243,
subdivision 9. For facilities not subject to review by the commission under section 216B.2422 or
216B.243, a utility shall petition the commission for eligibility for cost recovery under this section
prior to requesting cost recovery for the facility. The commission may approve, or approve as
modified, a rate schedule that:
   (1) allows a utility to recover directly from customers on a timely basis the costs of qualifying
renewable energy projects, including:
   (i) return on investment;
   (ii) depreciation;
   (iii) ongoing operation and maintenance costs;
   (iv) taxes; and
   (v) costs of transmission and other ancillary expenses directly allocable to transmitting electricity
generated from a project meeting the specifications of this paragraph;
   (2) provides a current return on construction work in progress, provided that recovery of these
costs from Minnesota ratepayers is not sought through any other mechanism;
    (3) allows recovery of other expenses incurred that are directly related to a renewable

(1)             2012          12 percent
(2)             2016          17 percent
(3)             2020          20 percent
(4)             2025          25 percent.

    (b) An electric utility that owned a nuclear generating facility as of January 1, 2007, must
meet the requirements of this paragraph rather than paragraph (a). An electric utility subject to this
paragraph must generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by an eligible energy technology
to provide its retail customers in Minnesota or the retail customer of a distribution utility to which
the electric utility provides wholesale electric service so that at least the following percentages
of the electric utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota are generated by
eligible energy technologies by the end of the year indicated:
(1)             2010          15 percent
(2)             2012          18 percent
(3)             2016          25 percent
(4)             2020          30 percent.

   Of the 30 percent in 2020, at least 25 percent must be generated by solar energy or wind energy
conversion systems and the remaining five percent by other eligible energy technology. Of the 25
percent that must be generated by wind or solar, no more than one percent may be solar generated
and the remaining 24 percent or greater must be wind generated.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.23, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Authority to issue refund. (a) On determining that a public utility has charged a rate in
violation of this chapter, a commission rule, or a commission order, the commission, after conducting
a proceeding, may require the public utility to refund to its customers, in a manner approved by the
commission, any revenues the commission finds were collected as a result of the unlawful conduct.
Any refund authorized by this section is permitted in addition to any remedies authorized by section
216B.16 or any other law governing rates. Exercising authority under this section does not preclude
the commission from pursuing penalties under sections 216B.57 to 216B.61 for the same conduct.
      (b) This section must not be construed as allowing:
      (1) retroactive ratemaking;
    (2) refunds based on claims that prior or current approved rates have been unjust, unreasonable,
unreasonably preferential, discriminatory, insufficient, inequitable, or inconsistent in application to
a class of customers; or
   (3) refunds based on claims that approved rates have not encouraged energy conservation or
renewable energy use, or have not furthered the goals of section 216B.164, 216B.241, or 216C.05.
   (c) A refund under this subdivision does not apply to revenues collected more than six years
before the date of the notice of the commission proceeding required under this subdivision.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation
improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent
to 1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under
paragraph (d). The savings goals must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather
normalized average. A utility or association may elect to carry forward energy savings in excess
of 1.5 percent for a year to the succeeding three calendar years, except that savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects allowed under paragraph (d) may be carried forward for five years. A
particular energy savings can be used only for one year's goal.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy-savings plan by calendar year 2010.
    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request
the commissioner to adjust its annual energy-savings percentage goal based on its historical
conservation investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential
study, or other factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner
may not approve a plan that provides for an annual energy-savings goal of less than one percent of
gross annual retail energy sales from energy conservation improvements.
A utility or association may include in its energy conservation plan energy savings from electric
utility infrastructure projects approved by the commission under section 216B.1636 or waste
heat recovery converted into electricity projects that may count as energy savings in addition to
the minimum energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements.
Electric utility infrastructure projects must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that
which would have occurred through normal maintenance activity.
    (e) An energy-savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy-savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments to attain
the energy-savings goals of this subdivision that are not cost-effective even if the investment is
necessary to attain the energy-savings goals. For the purpose of this paragraph, in determining
cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and benefits to ratepayers, the
utility, participants, and society. In addition, the commissioner shall consider the rate at which an
association or municipal utility is increasing its energy savings and its expenditures on energy
conservation.
    (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available. The
commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity filing
an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner.

    Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5a. Qualifying solar energy project. (a) A utility or association may include in its
conservation plan programs for the installation of qualifying solar energy projects as defined
by section 216B.2411 to the extent of the spending allowed for generation projects by section
216B.2411. The cost-effectiveness of a qualifying solar energy project may be determined by
a different standard than for other energy conservation improvements under this section if the
commissioner determines it is in the public interest to do so to encourage solar energy projects.
Energy savings from qualifying solar energy projects may not be counted toward the minimum
energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements required under
subdivision 1c, but may, if the conservation plan is approved:
    (1) be counted toward energy savings above that minimum percentage; and

plan purchases of biomethane, and may use up to five percent of the total amount to be spent on
energy conservation improvements under this section for that purpose. The cost-effectiveness of
biomethane purchases may be determined by a different standard than for other energy conservation
improvements under this section if the commissioner determines that doing so is in the public interest
in order to encourage biomethane purchases. Energy savings from purchasing biomethane may not
be counted toward the minimum energy-savings goal of at least one percent for energy conservation
improvements required under subdivision 1c, but may, if the conservation plan is approved:
    (1) be counted toward energy savings above that minimum percentage; and
    (2) be considered when establishing performance incentives under subdivision 2c.
   (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, "biomethane" means biogas produced through anaerobic

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.241, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Building performance standards; Sustainable Building 2030. (a) The purpose of
this subdivision is to establish cost-effective energy-efficiency performance standards for new and
substantially reconstructed commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings that can significantly
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by lowering energy use in new and substantially reconstructed
buildings. For the purposes of this subdivision, the establishment of these standards may be referred
to as Sustainable Building 2030.
    (b) The commissioner shall contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research at
the University of Minnesota to coordinate development and implementation of energy-efficiency
performance standards, strategic planning, research, data analysis, technology transfer, training,
and other activities related to the purpose of Sustainable Building 2030. The commissioner and the
Center for Sustainable Building Research shall, in consultation with utilities, builders, developers,
building operators, and experts in building design and technology, develop a Sustainable Building
2030 implementation plan that must address, at a minimum, the following issues:
   (1) training architects to incorporate the performance standards in building design;
   (2) incorporating the performance standards in utility conservation improvement programs; and
    (3) developing procedures for ongoing monitoring of energy use in buildings that have adopted
the performance standards.
The plan must be submitted to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of
representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy by July 1, 2009.
    (c) Sustainable Building 2030 energy-efficiency performance standards must be firm,
quantitative measures of total building energy use and associated carbon dioxide emissions
per square foot for different building types and uses, that allow for accurate determinations
of a building's conformance with a performance standard. The energy-efficiency performance
standards must be updated every three or five years to incorporate all cost-effective measures. The
performance standards must reflect the reductions in carbon dioxide emissions per square foot
resulting from actions taken by utilities to comply with the renewable energy standards in section
216B.1691. The performance standards should be designed to achieve reductions equivalent to
the following reduction schedule, measured against energy consumption by an average building
in each applicable building sector in 2003: (1) 60 percent in 2010; (2) 70 percent in 2015; (3) 80
percent in 2020; and (4) 90 percent in 2025. A performance standard must not be established or
increased absent a conclusive engineering analysis that it is cost-effective based upon established
practices used in evaluating utility conservation improvement programs.
    (d) The annual amount of the contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research
is up to $500,000. The Center for Sustainable Building Research shall expend no more than
$150,000 of this amount each year on administration, coordination, and oversight activities
related to Sustainable Building 2030. The balance of contract funds must be spent on substantive
programmatic activities allowed under this subdivision that may be conducted by the Center
for Sustainable Building Research and others, and for subcontracts with not-for-profit energy
organizations, architecture and engineering firms, and other qualified entities to undertake
technical projects and activities in support of Sustainable Building 2030. The primary work to be
accomplished each year by qualified technical experts under subcontracts is the development and

thorough justification of recommendations for specific energy-efficiency performance standards.
Additional work may include:
    (1) research, development, and demonstration of new energy-efficiency technologies and
techniques suitable for commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings;
    (2) analysis and evaluation of practices in building design, construction, commissioning and
operations, and analysis and evaluation of energy use in the commercial, industrial, and institutional
sectors;
   (3) analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Sustainable Building
2030 performance standards, conservation improvement programs, and building energy codes;
   (4) development and delivery of training programs for architects, engineers, commissioning
agents, technicians, contractors, equipment suppliers, developers, and others in the building
industries; and
   (5) analyze and evaluate the effect of building operations on energy use.
    (e) The commissioner shall require utilities to develop and implement conservation
improvement programs that are expressly designed to achieve energy efficiency goals consistent
with the Sustainable Building 2030 performance standards. These programs must include
offerings of design assistance and modeling, financial incentives, and the verification of the proper
installation of energy-efficient design components in new and substantially reconstructed buildings.
A utility's design assistance program must consider the strategic planting of trees and shrubs
around buildings as an energy conservation strategy for the designed project. A utility making
an expenditure under its conservation improvement program that results in a building meeting
the Sustainable Building 2030 performance standards may claim the energy savings toward its
energy-savings goal established in subdivision 1c.
    (f) The commissioner shall report to the legislature every three years, beginning January 15,
2010, on the cost-effectiveness and progress of implementing the Sustainable Building 2030
performance standards and shall make recommendations on the need to continue the program as
described in this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

     (3) projects in Minnesota to install a qualifying solar energy project as defined in subdivision 2.
    (b) A municipality, rural electric association, or public utility that offers a program to customers
to promote installing qualifying solar energy projects may request authority from the commissioner
to exceed the five percent limit in paragraph (a), but not to exceed ten percent, to meet customer
demand for installation of qualifying solar energy projects. In considering this request, the
commissioner shall consider customer interest in qualifying solar energy and the impact on other
customers. A municipality, rural electric association, or public utility may not participate in a
qualifying solar energy project on a property unless it is provided evidence that all reasonable
cost-effective conservation investments have previously been made to the property.

     Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.2412, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Decoupling criteria. The commission shall, by order, establish criteria and standards
for decoupling. The commission may establish these criteria and standards in a separate proceeding
or in a general rate case or other proceeding in which it approves a pilot program, and shall design
the criteria and standards to mitigate the impact on public utilities of the energy-savings goals
under section 216B.241 without adversely affecting utility ratepayers. In designing the criteria, the
commission shall consider energy efficiency, weather, and cost of capital, among other factors.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.2424, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Reduction of biomass mandate. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision 5, the biomass
electric energy mandate must be reduced from 125 megawatts to 110 megawatts.
    (b) The Public Utilities Commission shall approve a request pending before the commission
as of May 15, 2003, for amendments to and assignment of a power purchase agreement with the
owner of a facility that uses short-rotation, woody crops as its primary fuel previously approved
to satisfy a portion of the biomass mandate if the owner of the project agrees to reduce the size
of its project from 50 megawatts to 35 megawatts, while maintaining an average price for energy
in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement at or below $104 per
megawatt-hour, exclusive of any price adjustments that may take effect subsequent to commission
approval of the power purchase agreement, as amended. The commission shall also approve, as
necessary, any subsequent assignment or sale of the power purchase agreement or ownership of the
project to an entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal utilities located
north of Constitutional Route No. 8, as described in section 161.114, which currently own electric
and steam generation facilities using coal as a fuel and which propose to retrofit their existing
municipal electrical generating facilities to utilize biomass fuels in order to perform the power

purchase agreement.
    (c) If the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) is assigned to an entity that is,
or becomes, owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal entities as described in
paragraph (b), and the power purchase agreement meets the price requirements of paragraph (b), the
commission shall approve any amendments to the power purchase agreement necessary to reflect
the changes in project location and ownership and any other amendments made necessary by those
changes. The commission shall also specifically find that:
    (1) the power purchase agreement complies with and fully satisfies the provisions of this section
to the full extent of its 35-megawatt capacity;
    (2) all costs incurred by the public utility and all amounts to be paid by the public utility to the
project owner under the terms of the power purchase agreement are fully recoverable pursuant to
section 216B.1645;
   (3) subject to prudency review by the commission, the public utility may recover from its
Minnesota retail customers the Minnesota jurisdictional portion of the amounts that may be
incurred and paid by the public utility during the full term of the power purchase agreement; and
   (4) if the purchase power agreement meets the requirements of this subdivision, it is reasonable
and in the public interest.
    (d) The commission shall specifically approve recovery by the public utility of any and all
Minnesota jurisdictional costs incurred by the public utility to improve, construct, install, or upgrade
transmission, distribution, or other electrical facilities owned by the public utility or other persons
in order to permit interconnection of the retrofitted biomass-fueled generating facilities or to obtain
transmission service for the energy provided by the facilities to the public utility pursuant to section
216B.1645, and shall disapprove any provision in the power purchase agreement that requires the
developer or owner of the project to pay the jurisdictional costs or that permit the public utility to
terminate the power purchase agreement as a result of the existence of those costs or the public
utility's obligation to pay any or all of those costs.
    (e) Upon request by the project owner, the public utility shall agree to amend the power
purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) and approved by the commission as required by
paragraph (c). The amendment must be negotiated and executed within 45 days of the effective
date of this section and must apply to prices paid after January 1, 2009. The average price for
energy in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement must not
exceed $104 per megawatt hour by more than five percent. The public utility shall request approval
of the amendment by the commission within 30 days of execution of the amended power purchase
agreement. The amendment is not effective until approval by the commission. The commission
shall act on the amendment within 90 days of submission of the request by the public utility. Upon
approval of the amended power purchase agreement, the commission shall allow the public utility
to recover the costs of the amended power purchase agreement, as provided in section 216B.1645.

    Subd. 3. Assessing all public utilities. The department and commission shall quarterly, at least
30 days before the start of each quarter, estimate the total of their expenditures in the performance
of their duties relating to (1) public utilities under section 216A.085, sections 216B.01 to 216B.67,
other than amounts chargeable to public utilities under subdivision 2 ­    r, 6, or 7 and (2) alternative

energy engineering activity under section 216C.261. The remainder, except the amount assessed
against cooperatives and municipalities for alternative energy engineering activity under subdivision
5, shall be assessed by the commission and department to the several public utilities in proportion to
their respective gross operating revenues from retail sales of gas or electric service within the state
during the last calendar year. The assessment shall be paid into the state treasury within 30 days after
the bill has been transmitted via mail, personal delivery, or electronic service to the several public
utilities, which shall constitute notice of the assessment and demand of payment thereof. The total
amount which may be assessed to the public utilities, under authority of this subdivision, shall not
exceed one-sixth of one percent of the total gross operating revenues of the public utilities during
the calendar year from retail sales of gas or electric service within the state. The assessment for
the third quarter of each fiscal year shall be adjusted to compensate for the amount by which actual
expenditures by the commission and department for the preceding fiscal year were more or less than
the estimated expenditures previously assessed.

   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 216B.62, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Audit investigation costs. The audit investigation account is created as a separate
account in the special revenue fund in the state treasury. If the commission, in a proceeding upon
its own motion, on complaint, or upon an application to it, determines that it is necessary, in order
to carry out its duties imposed under this chapter or chapter 216, 216A, 216E, 216F, or 216G, to
conduct an investigation or audit of any public utility operations, practices, or policies requiring
specialized technical professional investigative services for the inquiry, the commission may request
the commissioner of commerce to seek authority from the commissioner of finance to incur costs
reasonably attributable to the specialized services. If the investigation or audit is approved by the
commissioner of finance, the commissioner of commerce shall carry out the investigation in the
manner directed by the commission and shall render separate bills to the public utility for the costs

LEGISLATURE.
    The commissioner of commerce, in consultation with the Public Utilities Commission, shall
annually by January 15 submit a written report to the chairs and the ranking minority members of
the legislative committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy that contains a narrative
describing what electric transmission infrastructure is needed within the state over the next 15 years
and what specific progress is being made to meet that need. To the extent possible, the report must
contain a description of specific transmission needs and the current status of proposals to address that
need. The report must identify any barriers to meeting transmission infrastructure needs and make
recommendations, including any legislation, that are necessary to overcome those barriers. The
report must be based on the best available information and must describe what assumptions are made
as the basis for the report. If the commissioner determines that there are difficulties in accurately
assessing future transmission infrastructure needs, the commissioner shall explain those difficulties
as part of the report. The commissioner is not required to conduct original research to support the
report. The commissioner may utilize information the commissioner, the commission, and the Office
of Energy Security possess and utilize in carrying out their existing statutory duties related to the
state's transmission infrastructure. The report must be in easily understood, nontechnical terms.

resources will consult with the commissioner of finance to the extent necessary to ensure this and
will furnish the commissioner of finance a list of projects to be financed from the account in order
of their priority. The legislature assumes that many projects for preservation and replacement of
portions of existing capital assets will constitute betterments and capital improvements within
the meaning of the Constitution and capital expenditures under generally accepted accounting
principles, and will be financed more efficiently and economically under this section than by direct
appropriations for specific projects.
   (b) An appropriation for asset preservation must not be used to acquire land or to acquire or
construct buildings or other facilities.
    (c) Capital budget expenditures for natural resource asset preservation and replacement
projects must be for one or more of the following types of capital projects that support the existing
programmatic mission of the department: code compliance including health and safety, Americans
with Disabilities Act requirements, hazardous material abatement, access improvement, or air
quality improvement; building energy efficiency improvements using current best practices;
building or infrastructure repairs necessary to preserve the interior and exterior of existing
buildings; or renovation of other existing improvements to land, including but not limited to trails
and bridges.
   (d) Up to ten percent of an appropriation awarded under this section may be used for design
costs for projects eligible to be funded from this account in anticipation of future funding from the
account.

    Subd. 3. Reporting priorities. The commissioner of natural resources must establish priorities
within its natural resource asset preservation and replacement projects. By January 15 of each year,
the commissioner must submit to the commissioner of finance and to the chairs of the house and
senate committees with jurisdiction over environment and natural resources finance and capital
investment a list of the projects that have been paid for with money from a natural resource asset
preservation and replacement appropriation during the preceding calendar year as well as a list of
those priority projects for which natural resource asset preservation and replacement appropriations
will be sought in that year's legislative session.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 134.45, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 8. Sale of public library funded with state bond proceeds. If the commissioner of
education and the local or regional governmental entity that owns a public library that has been
improved with state bond proceeds under this section determines that the library is no longer usable
or needed for the purposes for which the grant of state bond funds was made, the owner of the
public library may sell the property in the manner authorized by law for the sale of other property
owned by that jurisdiction for its fair market value. The sale must be approved by the commissioner
of finance. Notwithstanding section 16A.695, subdivision 3, clause (2), the net proceeds must be
applied as follows: first, to pay the state the amount of state bond proceeds used to acquire or better
the property; and second, any remaining amount must be paid to the local or regional governmental
owner of the property sold. When the sale is complete and the sale proceeds have been applied as
provided in this subdivision, section 16A.695 no longer applies to the property and the property is
no longer state bond financed property.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
the sale of public library property on or after that date.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 135A.046, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

and Replacement (HEAPR) projects must be for one or more of the following: code compliance
including health and safety, Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, hazardous material
abatement, access improvement, or air quality improvement; building energy efficiency
improvements using current best practices; or building or infrastructure repairs necessary to
preserve the interior and exterior of existing buildings; or renewal to support the existing
programmatic mission of the campuses. Up to ten percent of an appropriation awarded under
this section may be used for design costs for projects eligible to be funded from this account in
anticipation of future funding from the account.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 136F.98, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Issuance of bonds. The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and
Universities or a successor may issue revenue bonds under sections 136F.90 to 136F.97 whose
aggregate principal amount at any time may not exceed $200,000,000, and payable from the
revenue appropriated to the fund established by section 136F.94, and use the proceeds together
with other public or private money that may otherwise become available to acquire land, and
to acquire, construct, complete, remodel, and equip structures or portions thereof to be used for
dormitory, residence hall, student union, food service, parking purposes, or for any other similar
revenue-producing building or buildings of such type and character as the board finds desirable for
the good and benefit of the state colleges and universities. Before issuing the bonds or any part of

eligible. The commissioner may make payments for documented incremental costs incurred by a
party, may determine an estimate of the costs at the sole discretion of the commissioner, or may

documented cost, the provider is able to acquire payment from another source for that cost, the
provider shall reimburse the commissioner in the amount paid.

nursing facility. In a nursing facility the commissioner shall pay all of the costs determined under
subdivision 1.

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 12A.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3. Waiver of Contract Approval Procedures. State and federal disaster assistance
distributed by the commissioner of public safety is not subject to the contract approval procedures
of chapter 16A, 16B, or 16C, or any other law. The commissioner of public safety may adopt
internal procedures to administer and monitor these aids and grants.
   Sec. 16. 2009 FLOOD LOSS; CITY REPLACEMENT AID.
    Subdivision 1. Flood net tax capacity loss. The county assessor of each qualified county shall
compute a hypothetical city taxable net tax capacity for each city in the county based upon market
values for assessment year 2010 and the class rates that were in effect for assessment year 2009. The
amount, if any, by which the assessment year 2009 total taxable net tax capacity of the city exceeds
the hypothetical taxable net tax capacity of the city is the city's "flood net tax capacity loss." A
county assessor of a qualified county that contains a city that has a flood net tax capacity loss that
exceeds five percent of its assessment year 2009 total taxable net tax capacity shall certify the city's
flood net tax capacity loss to the commissioner of revenue by August 1, 2009.
  As used in this section, a "qualified county" is a county located within the area included in
DR-1830.
    Subd. 2. Flood loss aid. In 2010, each city with a flood net tax capacity loss equal to or greater
than five percent of its assessment year 2009 total taxable net tax capacity is entitled to flood loss
aid equal to the flood net tax capacity loss times the city's average local tax rate for taxes payable
in 2009.
   Subd. 3. Duties of commissioner. The commissioner of revenue shall determine each city's aid
amount under this section. The commissioner shall notify each eligible city of its flood loss aid
amount by August 15, 2009. The commissioner shall make payments to each city after July 1, and
before July 20, 2010.
   Subd. 4. Optional city expenditure. A city that receives aid under this section may choose to
expend a portion of the aid received for repair of county roads located within the city.
    Subd. 5. Appropriation. The amount necessary to pay the aid amounts under this section in
fiscal year 2011, for calendar year 2010, is appropriated to the commissioner of revenue from the
general fund.
   Sec. 17. EFFECTIVE DATE.

eligible for declining pupil unit aid equal to the lesser of $242,000 or the product of $5,124
and the number of adjusted pupil units lost during that year as a result of the April 2009 fire.

within the inspector's jurisdiction;
   (2) to see that sections 21.80 to 21.92 and rules adopted under those sections are carried out

   (3) to see that sections 21.71 to 21.78 and rules adopted under those sections are carried out
within the inspector's jurisdiction;
   (4) to participate in the control programs for invasive plant species, feed, fertilizer, pesticide,
and plant and insect pests when requested, in writing, to do so by the commissioner;
   (5) to participate in other agricultural programs under the control of the commissioner when

   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18.81, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Nonperformance by inspectors; reimbursement for expenses. If local weed
inspectors neglect or fail to do their duty as prescribed in this section, the county agricultural
inspector ­

           ­­ l­ or county-designated employee, in consultation with the commissioner, may issue a
             a­l
notice to the inspector providing instructions on how and when to do their duty. If, after the time
allowed in the notice, the local weed inspector has not complied as directed, the county agricultural
inspector or county-designated employee may consult with the commissioner to perform the duty
for the local weed inspector. A claim for the expense of doing the local weed inspector's duty
is a legal charge against the municipality in which the inspector has jurisdiction. The county
agricultural inspector ­ do

itemized statement of costs with the clerk of the municipality in which the work was performed.
The municipality shall immediately issue proper warrants to the county for the work performed. If
the municipality fails to issue the warrants, the county auditor may include the amount contained in
the itemized statement of costs as part of the next annual tax levy in the municipality and withhold
that amount from the municipality in making its next apportionment.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18.82, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

             ­ An inspector or county-designated employee may consider it necessary to control or
eradicate noxious weeds along with all or a part of a growing crop to prevent the maturation and
spread of noxious weeds within the inspector's or county-designated employee's jurisdiction. If this
situation exists, the w
                      ­­
                       e­
                        ed
                         ­ inspector or county-designated employee may have the noxious weeds

county-designated employee may hire a person to control or eradicate noxious weeds if the person
who owns the land, the person who occupies the land, or the person responsible for the maintenance
of public land has failed to comply with an individual notice or with the published general notice
when an individual notice cannot be served. The person hired must have authorization, in writing,
from the w­­

             ­ inspector or county-designated employee to enter upon the land.
    Subd. 7. Expenses; reimbursements. A claim for the expense of controlling or eradicating
noxious weeds, which may include the costs of serving notices, is a legal charge against the county
in which the land is located. The officers having the work done must file with the county auditor a
verified and itemized statement of cost for all services rendered on each separate tract or lot of land.
The county auditor shall immediately issue proper warrants to the persons named on the statement
as having rendered services. To reimburse the county for its expenditure in this regard, the county
auditor shall certify the total amount due and, unless an appeal is made in accordance with section
18.84, enter it on the tax roll as a tax upon the land and it must be collected as other real estate taxes
are collected.
    If public land is involved, the amount due must be paid from funds provided for maintenance
of the land or from the general revenue or operating fund of the agency responsible for the land.
Each claim for control or eradication of noxious weeds on public lands must first be approved by
the commissioner of agriculture.

or appropriated to the account and any money received by the account as gifts or grants or other
private or public funds obtained for the purposes in section 18.91 must be credited to the account.
The money in the account is annually appropriated to the commissioner to implement section 18.90.
    Sec. 42. [18.90] GRANT PROGRAM.
    (a) From funds available in the noxious weed and invasive plant species assistance account
established in section 18.89, the commissioner shall administer a grant program to assist
counties and municipalities and other weed management entities in the cost of implementing and
maintaining noxious weed control programs and in addressing special weed control problems. The
commissioner shall receive applications by counties, municipalities, weed management areas, and
weed management entities for assistance under this section and, in consultation with the Noxious
Weed Advisory Committee, award grants for any of the following eligible purposes:
    (1) to conduct applied research to solve locally significant weed management problems;
   (2) to demonstrate innovative control methods or land management practices which have the
potential to reduce landowner costs to control noxious weeds or improve the effectiveness of noxious
weed control;
    (3) to encourage the ongoing support of weed management areas;
    (4) to respond to introductions or infestations of invasive plants that threaten or potentially

threaten the productivity of cropland and rangeland over a wide area;
    (5) to respond to introductions or infestations of invasive plant species that threaten or potentially
threaten the productivity of biodiversity of wildlife and fishery habitats on public and private lands;
   (6) to respond to special weed control problems involving weeds not included in the list of
noxious weeds published and distributed by the commissioner;
    (7) to conduct monitoring or surveillance activities to detect, map, or determine the distribution
of invasive plant species and to determine susceptible locations for the introduction or spread of
invasive plant species; and
   (8) to conduct educational activities.
   (b) The commissioner shall select and prioritize applications for assistance under this section
based on the following considerations:
    (1) the seriousness of the noxious weed or invasive plant problem or potential problem addressed
by the project;
   (2) the ability of the project to provide timely intervention to save current and future costs of
control and eradication;
   (3) the likelihood that the project will prevent or resolve the problem or increase knowledge
about resolving similar problems in the future;
   (4) the extent to which the project will leverage federal funds and other nonstate funds;
   (5) the extent to which the applicant has made progress in addressing noxious weed or invasive
plant problems;
   (6) the extent to which the project will provide a comprehensive approach to the control or
eradication of noxious weeds;
   (7) the extent to which the project will reduce the total population or area of infestation of a
noxious weed;
   (8) the extent to which the project uses the principles of integrated vegetation management and
sound science; and
   (9) other factors that the commissioner determines to be relevant.
   (c) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a person of the duty or responsibility to
control the spread of noxious weeds on lands owned and controlled by the person.
   Sec. 43. [18.91] ADVISORY COMMITTEE; MEMBERSHIP.
   Subdivision 1. Duties. The commissioner shall consult with the Noxious Weed Advisory
Committee to advise the commissioner concerning responsibilities under the noxious weed control

    Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18B.065, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Cooperative agreements. (a) The commissioner may enter into cooperative
agreements with state agencies and local units of government for administration of the waste

under subdivision 7, the excess is appropriated to the commissioner to perform waste pesticide
collections under this section.
    Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18B.26, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirement. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) to (d), a person may
not use or distribute a pesticide in this state unless it is registered with the commissioner. Pesticide
registrations expire on December 31 of each year and may be renewed on or before that date for the
following calendar year.
    (b) Registration is not required if a pesticide is shipped from one plant or warehouse to another
plant or warehouse operated by the same person and used solely at the plant or warehouse as an
ingredient in the formulation of a pesticide that is registered under this chapter.
     (c) An unregistered pesticide that was previously registered with the commissioner may be
used for a period of two years following the cancellation of the registration of the pesticide, unless
the commissioner determines that the continued use of the pesticide would cause unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment, or with the written permission of the commissioner. To use the
unregistered pesticide at any time after the two-year period, the pesticide end user must demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the commissioner, if requested, that the pesticide has been continuously
registered under a different brand name or by a different manufacturer and has similar composition,
or, the pesticide end user obtains the written permission of the commissioner.
   (d) The commissioner may allow specific pesticide products that are not registered with the
commissioner to be distributed in this state for use in another state.
    (e) Each pesticide with a unique United States Environmental Protection Agency pesticide
registration number or a unique brand name must be registered with the commissioner.
    (f) It is unlawful for a person to distribute or use a pesticide in the state, or to sell into the state
for use in the state, any pesticide product that has not been registered by the commissioner and
for which the applicable pesticide registration application fee, gross sales fee, or waste pesticide
program surcharge is not paid pursuant to subdivisions 3 and 4.
    (g) Every person who sells for use in the state a pesticide product that has been registered by the
commissioner shall pay to the commissioner the applicable registration application fees, sales fees,
and waste pesticide program surcharges. These sales expressly include all sales made electronically,
telephonically, or by any other means that result in a pesticide product being shipped to or used in
the state. There is a rebuttable presumption that pesticide products that are sold or distributed in or
into the state by any person are sold or distributed for use in the state.
    Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18B.26, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Registration application and gross sales fee. (a) For an agricultural pesticide, a
registrant shall pay an annual registration application fee for each agricultural pesticide ­o                         t­­­b

a nonagricultural pesticide, a registrant shall pay a minimum annual registration application fee
for each nonagricultural pesticide of $350. The fee is due by December 31 preceding the year
for which the application for registration is made. The fee is nonrefundable. The registrant of a
nonagricultural pesticide shall pay, in addition to the $350 minimum fee, a fee of 0.5 percent of
annual gross sales of the nonagricultural pesticide in the state and the annual gross sales of the
nonagricultural pesticide sold into the state for use in this state. The commissioner may not assess a
fee under this paragraph if the amount due based on percent of annual gross sales is less than $10. The
registrant shall secure sufficient sales information of nonagricultural pesticides distributed into this
state from distributors and dealers, regardless of distributor location, to make a determination. Sales
of nonagricultural pesticides in this state and sales of nonagricultural pesticides for use in this state
by out-of-state distributors are not exempt and must be included in the registrant's annual report, as
required under paragraph ­                      (­
                                                 c­ ) (g), and fees shall be paid by the registrant based upon those reported
sales. Sales of nonagricultural pesticides in the state for use outside of the state are exempt from the
­

      l­c­­
          a­i
            t­o­n­ gross sales fee in this paragraph if the registrant properly documents the sale location and
distributors. A registrant paying more than the minimum fee shall pay the balance due by March 1
based on the gross sales of the nonagricultural pesticide by the registrant for the preceding calendar
year. T   ­h­­e­­ f­e­e­­fo­­r­d­­si­­n

    18H.09 NURSERY STOCK CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.
    (a) All nursery stock growing at sites identified by nursery stock dealers or nursery stock growers
and submitted for inspection must be inspected by the commissioner within the previous 12 months
prior to sale and found apparently free from quarantine and regulated nonquarantine pests as well
as significantly dangerous or potentially damaging plant pests. The commissioner may waive a site
inspection under the following conditions:
    (1) the nursery stock is not going to be sold within 12 months;
    (2) the nursery stock will not be moved out of Minnesota; and
   (3) the nursery site or stock is not subject to certification requirements associated with a state or
federally regulated or quarantined plant pest.
    All nursery stock originating from out of state and offered for sale in Minnesota must have been
inspected by the appropriate state or federal agency during the previous 12 months and found free
from quarantine and regulated nonquarantine pests as well as significantly dangerous or potentially
damaging plant pests. A nursery stock certificate is valid from January 1 to December 31.
    (b) Nursery stock must be accessible to the commissioner for inspection during regular business
hours. Weeds or other growth that hinder a proper inspection are grounds to suspend or withhold a
certificate or require a reinspection.
    (c) Inspection reports issued to growers must contain a list of the plant pests found at the time
of inspection. Withdrawal-from-distribution orders are considered part of the inspection reports. A
withdrawal-from-distribution order must contain a list of plants withdrawn from distribution and
the location of the plants.
    (d) The commissioner may post signs to delineate sections withdrawn from distribution. These
signs must remain in place until the commissioner removes them or grants written permission to the
grower to remove the signs.
    (e) Inspection reports issued to dealers must outline the violations involved and corrective
actions to be taken including withdrawal-from-distribution orders which would specify nursery
stock that could not be distributed from a certain area.
   (f) Optional inspections of plants may be conducted by the commissioner upon request by any
persons desiring an inspection. A fee as provided in section 18H.07 must be charged for such an

   Sec. 76. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 18H.10, is amended to read:
   18H.10 STORAGE OF NURSERY STOCK.
   All nursery stock must be kept and displayed under conditions of temperature, light, and moisture
sufficient to maintain the viability and vigor of the nursery stock. Packaged dormant nursery stock
must be stored under conditions that retard growth, prevent etiolated growth, and protect its viability.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 77. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 28A.085, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Violations; prohibited acts. The commissioner may charge a reinspection fee
for each reinspection of a food handler that:
    (1) is found with a major violation of requirements in chapter 28, 29, 30, 31, 31A, 32, 33, or 34,
or rules adopted under one of those chapters;
    (2) is found with a violation of section 31.02, 31.161, or 31.165, and requires a follow-up
inspection after an administrative meeting held pursuant to section 31.14; or
    (3) fails to correct equipment and facility deficiencies as required in rules adopted under chapter
28, 29, 30, 31, 31A, 32, or 34. The first reinspection of a firm with gross food sales under $1,000,000
must be assessed at ­  $7

The fee for a subsequent reinspection of a firm for the same violation is 50 percent of their current
license fee or $­­20
                   ­0­ $300, whichever is greater. The establishment must be issued written notice of

eligible to farm or own agricultural land with ownership interests, individuals residing within 30
miles of the plant, or of any other entity with less than ten percent ownership interest, but the
claimant must retain information within its files confirming the accuracy of the data provided.
This data must be made available to the commissioner upon request. Not later than the 15th day
of February in each year the commissioner shall deliver to the chairs of the standing committees
of the senate and the house of representatives that deal with agricultural policy and agricultural
finance issues an annual report summarizing aggregated data from plants receiving payments
under this section during the preceding calendar year. Audited financial statements and notes and
disclosure statements submitted to the commissioner are nonpublic data under section 13.02,

    (b) No payments shall be made for ethanol production that occurs after June 30, 2010. A producer
of ethanol shall not transfer the producer's eligibility for payments under this section to an ethanol
plant at a different location.
    (c) If the level of production at an ethanol plant increases due to an increase in the production
capacity of the plant, the payment under paragraph (a) applies to the additional increment of
production until ten years after the increased production began. Once a plant's production capacity
reaches 15,000,000 gallons per year, no additional increment will qualify for the payment.
   (d) Total payments under paragraphs (a) and (c) to a producer in a fiscal year may not exceed
$3,000,000.
    (e) By the last day of October, January, April, and July, each producer shall file a claim for
payment for ethanol production during the preceding three calendar months. A producer that files a
claim under this subdivision shall include a statement of the producer's total ethanol production in
Minnesota during the quarter covered by the claim. For each claim and statement of total ethanol
production filed under this subdivision, the volume of ethanol production must be examined by an
independent certified public accountant in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
   (f) Payments shall be made November 15, February 15, May 15, and August 15. A separate
payment shall be made for each claim filed. Except as provided in paragraph (g), the total quarterly
payment to a producer under this paragraph may not exceed $750,000.
    (g) Notwithstanding the quarterly payment limits of paragraph (f), the commissioner shall make
an additional payment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to ethanol producers for the lesser of:
(1) 20 cents per gallon of production in the fourth quarter of the year that is greater than 3,750,000
gallons; or (2) the total amount of payments lost during the first three quarters of the fiscal year due
to plant outages, repair, or major maintenance. Total payments to an ethanol producer in a fiscal
year, including any payment under this paragraph, must not exceed the total amount the producer
is eligible to receive based on the producer's approved production capacity. The provisions of this
paragraph apply only to production losses that occur in quarters beginning after December 31, 1999.
   (h) The commissioner shall reimburse ethanol producers for any deficiency in payments
during earlier quarters if the deficiency occurred because of unallotment or because appropriated
money was insufficient to make timely payments in the full amount provided in paragraph (a).
Notwithstanding the quarterly or annual payment limitations in this subdivision, the commissioner

shall begin making payments for earlier deficiencies in each fiscal year that appropriations for
ethanol payments exceed the amount required to make eligible scheduled payments. Payments for
earlier deficiencies must continue until the deficiencies for each producer are paid in full, except
the commissioner shall not make a deficiency payment to an entity that no longer produces ethanol
on a commercial scale at the location for which the entity qualified for producer payments,­ or to an
assignee of the entity, or an entity that is not majority owned by farmers or other entities eligible
to farm or own agricultural land under section 500.24 or individuals residing within 30 miles of
the plant.

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 197.46, is amended to read:
  197.46 VETERANS PREFERENCE ACT; REMOVAL FORBIDDEN; RIGHT OF
MANDAMUS.
     Any person whose rights may be in any way prejudiced contrary to any of the provisions of
this section, shall be entitled to a writ of mandamus to remedy the wrong. No person holding a
position by appointment or employment in the several counties, cities, towns, school districts and
all other political subdivisions in the state, who is a veteran separated from the military service under
honorable conditions, shall be removed from such position or employment except for incompetency
or misconduct shown after a hearing, upon due notice, upon stated charges, in writing.
    Any veteran who has been notified of the intent to discharge the veteran from an appointed
position or employment pursuant to this section shall be notified in writing of such intent to discharge
and of the veteran's right to request a hearing within 60 days of receipt of the notice of intent to
discharge. The failure of a veteran to request a hearing within the provided 60-day period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Such failure shall also waive all other available legal
remedies for reinstatement.
    Request for a hearing concerning such a discharge shall be made in writing and submitted by
mail or personal service to the employment office of the concerned employer or other appropriate
office or person.
    In all governmental subdivisions having an established civil service board or commission, or
merit system authority, such hearing for removal or discharge shall be held before such civil service
board or commission or merit system authority. Where no such civil service board or commission
or merit system authority exists, such hearing shall be held by a board of three persons appointed
as follows: one by the governmental subdivision, one by the veteran, and the third by the two so
selected. In the event the two persons so selected do not appoint the third person within ten days
after the appointment of the last of the two, then the judge of the district court of the county wherein
the proceeding is pending, or if there be more than one judge in said county then any judge in
chambers, shall have jurisdiction to appoint, and upon application of either or both of the two so
selected shall appoint, the third person to the board and the person so appointed by the judge with
the two first selected shall constitute the board. The veteran may appeal from the decision of the
board upon the charges to the district court by causing written notice of appeal, stating the grounds
thereof, to be served upon the governmental subdivision or officer making the charges within 15 days
after notice of the decision and by filing the original notice of appeal with proof of service thereof
in the office of the court administrator of the district court within ten days after service thereof.
Nothing in section 197.455 or this section shall be construed to apply to the position of private
secretary, ­e

burden of establishing such relationship shall be upon the appointing officer in all proceedings and
actions relating thereto.
    All officers, boards, commissions, and employees shall conform to, comply with, and aid in all
proper ways in carrying into effect the provisions of section 197.455 and this section notwithstanding
any laws, charter provisions, ordinances or rules to the contrary. Any willful violation of such
sections by officers, officials, or employees is a misdemeanor.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 523.131, is amended to read:
  523.131 QUALIFICATION OF SUCCESSOR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT IN STATUTORY
SHORT FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY.
    If two or more attorneys-in-fact are originally appointed and one dies, resigns, or is unable to
serve, a successor attorney-in-fact named in a power of attorney executed in conformity with section
523.23 or a form prepared under section 523.231 replaces the attorney-in-fact who dies, resigns, or
is unable to serve. If the original attorneys-in-fact were required to act jointly, the attorneys-in-fact
acting at any time must act jointly. If the original attorneys-in-fact were allowed to act individually,
the attorneys-in-fact acting at any time may act individually. If attorneys-in-fact acting at any time
are required to act jointly, and there is only one remaining attorney-in-fact because of the death,
resignation, or inability to serve of all other original and successor attorneys-in-fact, the remaining
attorney-in-fact may act alone.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 523.16, is amended to read:
   523.16 AFFIDAVIT AS PROOF OF AUTHORITY OF ATTORNEY-IN-FACT.
    Subdivision 1. Multiple attorneys-in-fact. If the attorney-in-fact exercising a power pursuant to
a power of attorney has authority to act as a result of the death, incompetency, or resignation of one or
more attorneys-in-fact named in the power of attorney, an affidavit executed by the attorney-in-fact
setting forth the conditions precedent to the attorney-in-fact's authority to act under the power of
attorney and stating that those conditions have occurred is conclusive proof as to any party relying
on the affidavit of the occurrence of those conditions.
    Subd. 2. Attorney-in-fact for member of military. If an attorney-in-fact is exercising a power
pursuant to a power of attorney executed by a member of the military in a form prepared under
section 523.231, an affidavit executed by the attorney-in-fact setting forth the conditions precedent
to the authority to act and stating the existence of those conditions is conclusive proof as to any
party relying on the affidavit of the existence of those conditions.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 523.20, is amended to read:
  523.20 LIABILITY OF PARTIES REFUSING AUTHORITY OF ATTORNEY-IN-FACT
TO ACT ON PRINCIPAL'S BEHALF.
    Any party refusing to accept the authority of an attorney-in-fact to exercise a power granted by
a power of attorney which (1) is executed in conformity with section 523.23 or a form prepared
under section 523.231; (2) contains a specimen signature of the attorney-in-fact authorized to act;
(3) with regard to the execution or delivery of any recordable instrument relating to real property,
is accompanied by affidavits that satisfy the provisions of section 523.17; (4) with regard to any
other transaction, is signed by the attorney-in-fact in a manner conforming to section 523.18; and
5494                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [53RD DAY

(5) when applicable, is accompanied by an affidavit and any other document required by section
523.16, is liable to the principal and to the principal's heirs, assigns, and representative of the estate
of the principal in the same manner as the party would be liable had the party refused to accept the
authority of the principal to act on the principal's own behalf unless: (1) the party has actual notice
of the revocation of the power of attorney prior to the exercise of the power; (2) the duration of the
power of attorney specified in the power of attorney itself has expired; or (3) the party has actual
knowledge of the death of the principal or, if the power of attorney is not a durable power of attorney,
actual notice of a judicial determination that the principal is legally incompetent. This provision does
not negate any liability which a party would have to the principal or to the attorney-in-fact under
any other form of power of attorney under the common law or otherwise.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 523.23, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Failure to check or "X" a power. Any of the powers of the form in subdivision 1 or a
form prepared under section 523.231 which is not checked or X-ed is withheld by the principal from
the attorney-in-fact unless the power of (N) of the form in subdivision 1 or a comparable provision
in a form prepared under section 523.231 is checked or X-ed.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 523.23, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Requirements. Except for a form prepared under section 523.231, to constitute
a "statutory short form power of attorney," as this phrase is used in this chapter the wording
and content of the form in subdivision 1 must be duplicated exactly and with no modifications,
parts First, Second, and Third must be properly completed, and the signature of the principal
must be acknowledged. Failure to name a successor attorney-in-fact, to provide an expiration
date, or to complete part Fourth does not invalidate the power as a statutory short form power of
attorney. A power of attorney that does not satisfy the requirements of this subdivision or a form
prepared under section 523.231, but purports to be a statutory short form power of attorney, may
constitute a common law power of attorney that incorporates by reference the definitions of powers
contained in section 523.24; however, a party refusing to accept the authority of the common law
attorney-in-fact is not liable under section 523.20.
  Sec. 10. [523.231] ALTERNATIVE SHORT FORMS FOR GENERAL POWER OF
ATTORNEY FOR MILITARY MEMBERS IN ACTIVE SERVICE.
    The commissioner of military affairs may prepare alternative short forms for a general power of
attorney for military members in active service, as defined in section 190.05. A form prepared by
the commissioner is an alternative to the statutory short form in section 523.23.
   Sec. 11. INTERAGENCY STAFF.
    For fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the adjutant general must not use funds appropriated in this
article directly or indirectly to pay for the services of staff in the Office of the Governor."

date of a consolidation pursuant to section 123A.48, if the plan for consolidation so provides, or if the
plan for consolidation makes no provision concerning referendum revenues, the authorization for
all referendum revenues previously approved by the voters of all affected districts for those districts
pursuant to section 126C.17, subdivision 9, or its predecessor provision shall be recalculated as
provided in this subdivision. The referendum revenue authorization for the newly created district
shall be the revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that would raise an amount equal to the
combined dollar amount of the referendum revenues authorized by each of the component districts
for the year preceding the consolidation, unless the referendum revenue authorization of the newly
created district is subsequently modified pursuant to section 126C.17, subdivision 9.
    (b) The referendum allowance for a consolidated district in the years following consolidation
equals the average of the consolidating districts' existing authorities for those years, weighted by the
districts' resident marginal cost pupil units in the year preceding consolidation. For purposes of this
calculation, the referendum authorities used for individual districts shall not decrease from year to
year until such time as all existing authorities for all the consolidating districts have fully expired,
but shall increase if they were originally approved with consumer price index-based or other annual
increases.
    (c) The referendum revenue authorization for the newly created district shall continue for a
period of time equal to the longest period authorized for any component district.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal years 2010 and later.

revenues previously approved by the voters of all affected districts for those districts pursuant
to section 126C.17, subdivision 9, or its predecessor provision shall be combined as provided in
this subdivision. The referendum revenue authorization for the newly created district may be any
allowance per resident marginal cost pupil unit provided in the plan for consolidation, but may not

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Nonresident tuition rate; other costs. (a) For fiscal year 2006, when a school
district provides instruction and services outside the district of residence, board and lodging, and
any tuition to be paid, shall be paid by the district of residence. The tuition rate to be charged for
any child with a disability, excluding a pupil for whom tuition is calculated according to section
127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (d), must be the sum of (1) the actual cost of providing special
instruction and services to the child including a proportionate amount for special transportation and
unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily for special education,
plus (2) the amount of general education revenue and referendum aid attributable to the pupil, minus
(3) the amount of special education aid for children with a disability received on behalf of that child,
minus (4) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the regular classroom for
more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education revenue and referendum
aid, excluding portions attributable to district and school administration, district support services,
operations and maintenance, capital expenditures, and pupil transportation, attributable to that pupil
for the portion of time the pupil receives special instruction and services outside of the regular
classroom. If the boards involved do not agree upon the tuition rate, either board may apply to the
commissioner to fix the rate. Notwithstanding chapter 14, the commissioner must then set a date
for a hearing or request a written statement from each board, giving each board at least ten days'
notice, and after the hearing or review of the written statements the commissioner must make an
order fixing the tuition rate, which is binding on both school districts. General education revenue
and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated using the resident district's
average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per adjusted pupil unit.
    (b) For fiscal year 2007 and later, when a school district provides special instruction and
services for a pupil with a disability as defined in section 125A.02 outside the district of residence,
excluding a pupil for whom an adjustment to special education aid is calculated according to
section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (e), special education aid paid to the resident district
must be reduced by an amount equal to (1) the actual cost of providing special instruction and
services to the pupil, including a proportionate amount for special transportation and unreimbursed
building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily for special education, plus (2)
the amount of general education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to that
pupil, calculated using the resident district's average general education revenue and referendum
equalization aid per adjusted pupil unit excluding basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue
and secondary sparsity revenue, minus (3) the amount of special education aid for children with a

services outside the regular classroom for more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount
of general education revenue and referendum equalization aid, excluding portions attributable to
district and school administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital
expenditures, and pupil transportation, attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil
receives special instruction and services outside of the regular classroom, calculated using the
resident district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per adjusted
pupil unit excluding basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue and secondary sparsity
revenue and the serving district's basic skills revenue, elementary sparsity revenue and secondary
sparsity revenue per adjusted pupil unit. Notwithstanding clauses (1) and (4), for pupils served
by a cooperative unit without a fiscal agent school district, the general education revenue and
referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated using the resident district's
average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid excluding compensatory
revenue, elementary sparsity revenue, and secondary sparsity revenue. Special education aid
paid to the district or cooperative providing special instruction and services for the pupil must be
increased by the amount of the reduction in the aid paid to the resident district. Amounts paid to
cooperatives under this subdivision and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, shall be recognized and
reported as revenues and expenditures on the resident school district's books of account under
sections 123B.75 and 123B.76. If the resident district's special education aid is insufficient to make
the full adjustment, the remaining adjustment shall be made to other state aid due to the district.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (d)
and (e), a charter school where more than 30 percent of enrolled students receive special education
and related services, a site approved under section 125A.515, an intermediate district, a special
education cooperative, or a school district that served as the applicant agency for a group of school
districts for federal special education aids for fiscal year 2006 may apply to the commissioner for
authority to charge the resident district an additional amount to recover any remaining unreimbursed
costs of serving pupils with a disability. The application must include a description of the costs and
the calculations used to determine the unreimbursed portion to be charged to the resident district.
Amounts approved by the commissioner under this paragraph must be included in the tuition billings
or aid adjustments under paragraph (a) or (b), or section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraph (d) or
(e), as applicable.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision and section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (d) and
(e), "general education revenue and referendum equalization aid" means the sum of the general
education revenue according to section 126C.10, subdivision 1, excluding alternative teacher
compensation revenue, plus the referendum equalization aid according to section 126C.17,
subdivision 7, as adjusted according to section 127A.47, subdivision 7, paragraphs (a) to (c).

served at a cooperative unit shall be paid to the cooperative unit.
    (e) A district with school building openings, school building closings, changes in attendance
area boundaries, or other changes in programs or student demographics between the prior year
and the current year may reallocate compensatory revenue among sites to reflect these changes. A
district must report to the department any adjustments it makes according to this paragraph and the
department must use the adjusted compensatory revenue allocations in preparing the report required
under section 123B.76, subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.15, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Separate accounts. Each district and cooperative unit that receives basic skills revenue
shall maintain separate accounts to identify expenditures for salaries and programs related to basic
skills revenue.
     Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.17, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
     Subd. 9. Referendum revenue. (a) The revenue authorized by section 126C.10, subdivision 1,
may be increased in the amount approved by the voters of the district at a referendum called for the
purpose. The referendum may be called by the board ­               o­  ­­

                                                      t The referendum must be conducted one or two calendar
years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one election to
approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted by mail
under subdivision 11, paragraph (a), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue
per resident marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board,
of increased revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the
number of years for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall
increase annually by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual
inflationary increase calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing
referendum levy authority is expiring. In this case, the ballot may also compare the proposed levy
authority to the existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount,
if any, over the expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number
of years, not to exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a
ballot on the question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must
abbreviate the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under
section 275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies at the same amount per
pupil as in the previous year:

          "BY VOTING "YES" ON THIS BALLOT QUESTION, YOU ARE VOTING TO EXTEND
          AN EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REFERENDUM THAT IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE."
   The ballot may contain a textual portion with the information required in this subdivision and a
question stating substantially the following:
   "Shall the increase in the revenue proposed by (petition to) the board of ........., School District
No. .., be approved?"
    If approved, an amount equal to the approved revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit times
the resident marginal cost pupil units for the school year beginning in the year after the levy is
certified shall be authorized for certification for the number of years approved, if applicable, or until
revoked or reduced by the voters of the district at a subsequent referendum.
    (b) The board must prepare and deliver by first class mail at least 15 days but no more than 30
days before the day of the referendum to each taxpayer a notice of the referendum and the proposed
revenue increase. The board need not mail more than one notice to any taxpayer. For the purpose of
giving mailed notice under this subdivision, owners must be those shown to be owners on the records
of the county auditor or, in any county where tax statements are mailed by the county treasurer,
on the records of the county treasurer. Every property owner whose name does not appear on the
records of the county auditor or the county treasurer is deemed to have waived this mailed notice
unless the owner has requested in writing that the county auditor or county treasurer, as the case
may be, include the name on the records for this purpose. The notice must project the anticipated
amount of tax increase in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads,
apartments, and commercial-industrial property within the school district.
    The notice for a referendum may state that an existing referendum levy is expiring and project
the anticipated amount of increase over the existing referendum levy in the first year, if any,
in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads, apartments, and
commercial-industrial property within the district.
    The notice must include the following statement: "Passage of this referendum will result in
an increase in your property taxes." However, in cases of renewing existing levies, the notice
may include the following statement: "Passage of this referendum extends an existing operating
referendum at the same amount per pupil as in the previous year."
    (c) A referendum on the question of revoking or reducing the increased revenue amount
authorized pursuant to paragraph (a) may be called by the board ­                an

which is eligible for revenue under section 124D.86, subdivision 3, clause (1), (2), or (3), and
whose plan has been determined by the commissioner to be in compliance with Department of
Education rules relating to equality of educational opportunity and school desegregation and, for
a district eligible for revenue under section 124D.86, subdivision 3, clause (4) or (5), where the
acquisition of property under this subdivision is determined by the commissioner to contribute to
the implementation of the desegregation plan; or
    (2) a school district that participates in a joint program for interdistrict desegregation with a
district defined in clause (1) if the facility acquired under this subdivision is to be primarily used for

include personal property.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.41, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Retired employee health benefits. (a) A district may levy an amount up to the amount
the district is required by the collective bargaining agreement in effect on March 30, 1992, to pay
for health insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees
who have terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service
or other active service, as applicable, before July 1, 1992, and to pay for health insurance or
unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who have terminated
services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or other active
service, as applicable before July 1, 1998, if a sunset clause is in effect for the current collective
bargaining agreement. The total amount of the levy each year may not exceed $600,000.
    (b) In addition to the levy authority granted under paragraph (a), a school district may levy
for other postemployment benefits expenses. For purposes of this subdivision "postemployment
benefits" means benefits giving rise to a liability under Statement No. 45 of the Government
Accounting Standards Board. A district seeking levy authority under this subdivision must:
    (1) create or have created an actuarial liability to pay postemployment benefits to employees or
officers after their termination of service;
   (2) have a sunset clause in effect for the current collective bargaining agreement as required by
paragraph (a); and
   (3) apply for the authority in the form and manner required by the commissioner of education.
If the total levy authority requested under this paragraph exceeds the amount established in
paragraph (c), the commissioner must proportionately reduce each district's maximum levy
authority under this subdivision.
   (c) The maximum levy authority under paragraph (b) must not exceed the following amounts:
   (1) $9,242,000 for taxes payable in 2010;
   (2) $29,863,000 for taxes payable in 2011; and
    (3) for taxes payable in 2012 and later, the maximum levy authority must not exceed the sum of
the previous year's authority and $14,000,000.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.44, is amended to read:
   126C.44 SAFE SCHOOLS LEVY.
    (a) Each district may make a levy on all taxable property located within the district for the
purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for
a drug abuse prevention program as defined in section 609.101, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), in the
53RD DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                          5513

elementary schools; (3) to pay the costs for a gang resistance education training curriculum in the
district's schools; (4) to pay the costs for security in the district's schools and on school property;
(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.
    (c) A school district must set aside at least $3 per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit of the safe
schools levy proceeds for the purposes authorized under paragraph (a), clause (6). The district must
annually certify either that: (1) its total spending on services provided by the employees listed in
paragraph (a), clause (6), is not less than the sum of its expenditures for these purposes, excluding
amounts spent under this section, in the previous year plus the amount spent under this section; or
(2) that the district's full-time equivalent number of employees listed in paragraph (a), clause (6), is
not less than the number for the previous year.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal years 2010 and later.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 127A.47, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Alternative attendance programs. The general education aid and special education aid
for districts must be adjusted for each pupil attending a nonresident district under sections 123A.05
to 123A.08, 124D.03, 124D.08, and 124D.68. The adjustments must be made according to this
subdivision.
    (a) General education aid paid to a resident district must be reduced by an amount equal to the
referendum equalization aid attributable to the pupil in the resident district.
    (b) General education aid paid to a district serving a pupil in programs listed in this subdivision
must be increased by an amount equal to the greater of (1) the referendum equalization aid
attributable to the pupil in the nonresident district; or (2) the product of the district's open enrollment
concentration index, the maximum amount of referendum revenue in the first tier, and the district's
net open enrollment pupil units for that year. A district's open enrollment concentration index
equals the greater of: (i) zero, or (ii) the lesser of 1.0, or the difference between the district's ratio
of open enrollment pupil units served to its resident pupil units for that year and 0.2. This clause
does not apply to a school district where more than 50 percent of the open enrollment students are
enrolled solely in online learning courses.
5514                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [53RD DAY

    (c) If the amount of the reduction to be made from the general education aid of the resident
district is greater than the amount of general education aid otherwise due the district, the excess
reduction must be made from other state aids due the district.
     (d) For fiscal year 2006, the district of residence must pay tuition to a district or an area learning
center, operated according to paragraph (f), providing special instruction and services to a pupil
with a disability, as defined in section 125A.02, or a pupil, as defined in section 125A.51, who is
enrolled in a program listed in this subdivision. The tuition must be equal to (1) the actual cost of
providing special instruction and services to the pupil, including a proportionate amount for special
transportation and unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used primarily
for special education, minus (2) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the
regular classroom for more than 60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education
revenue and referendum aid attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil receives
special instruction and services outside of the regular classroom, excluding portions attributable
to district and school administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital
expenditures, and pupil transportation, minus (3) special education aid attributable to that pupil, that
is received by the district providing special instruction and services. For purposes of this paragraph,
general education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated
using the serving district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per
adjusted pupil unit.
    (e) For fiscal year 2007 and later, special education aid paid to a resident district must be reduced
by an amount equal to (1) the actual cost of providing special instruction and services, including
special transportation and unreimbursed building lease and debt service costs for facilities used
primarily for special education, for a pupil with a disability, as defined in section 125A.02, or a
pupil, as defined in section 125A.51, who is enrolled in a program listed in this subdivision, minus
(2) if the pupil receives special instruction and services outside the regular classroom for more than
60 percent of the school day, the amount of general education revenue and referendum equalization
aid attributable to that pupil for the portion of time the pupil receives special instruction and
services outside of the regular classroom, excluding portions attributable to district and school
administration, district support services, operations and maintenance, capital expenditures, and
pupil transportation, minus (3) special education aid attributable to that pupil, that is received by
the district providing special instruction and services. For purposes of this paragraph, general
education revenue and referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil must be calculated
using the serving district's average general education revenue and referendum equalization aid
per adjusted pupil unit. Special education aid paid to the district or cooperative providing special
instruction and services for the pupil, or to the fiscal agent district for a cooperative, must be
increased by the amount of the reduction in the aid paid to the resident district. If the resident
district's special education aid is insufficient to make the full adjustment, the remaining adjustment
shall be made to other state aids due to the district.
    (f) An area learning center operated by a service cooperative, intermediate district, education
district, or a joint powers cooperative may elect through the action of the constituent boards to charge
the resident district tuition for pupils rather than to have the general education revenue paid to a
fiscal agent school district. Except as provided in paragraph (d) or (e), the district of residence must
pay tuition equal to at least 90 percent of the district average general education revenue per pupil
unit minus an amount equal to the product of the formula allowance according to section 126C.10,

      120B.02 EDUCATIONAL EXPECTATIONS FOR MINNESOTA'S STUDENTS.
    (a) The legislature is committed to establishing rigorous academic standards for Minnesota's
public school students. To that end, the commissioner shall adopt in rule statewide academic
standards. The commissioner shall not prescribe in rule or otherwise the delivery system, classroom

    Subdivision 1. Elective standards. (a) A district must establish its own standards in the
following subject areas:
    (1) vocational and technical education; and
    (2) world languages.
    A school district must offer courses in all elective subject areas.
    (b) World languages teachers and other school staff should develop and implement world
languages programs that acknowledge and reinforce the language proficiency and cultural
awareness that non-English language speakers already possess, and encourage students' proficiency
in multiple world languages. Programs under this paragraph must encompass indigenous American
Indian languages and cultures, among other world languages and cultures. The department
shall consult with postsecondary institutions in developing related professional development
opportunities.
   (c) Any Minnesota public, charter, or nonpublic school may award Minnesota World Language
Proficiency Certificates or Minnesota World Language Proficiency High Achievement Certificates,

    Subd. 2. Revisions and reviews required. (a) The commissioner of education must
revise and appropriately embed technology and information literacy standards consistent with
recommendations from school media specialists into the state's academic standards and graduation
requirements and implement a review cycle for state academic standards and related benchmarks,
consistent with this subdivision. During each review cycle, the commissioner also must examine
the alignment of each required academic standard and related benchmark with the knowledge and
skills students need for college readiness and advanced work in the particular subject area.
    (b) The commissioner in the 2006-2007 school year must revise and align the state's academic
standards and high school graduation requirements in mathematics to require that students
satisfactorily complete the revised mathematics standards, beginning in the 2010-2011 school year.
Under the revised standards:
     (1) students must satisfactorily complete an algebra I credit by the end of eighth grade; and
   (2) students scheduled to graduate in the 2014-2015 school year or later must satisfactorily

    (c) The title of the report shall contain the name and number of the school district and read
"Annual Report on Curriculum, Instruction, and Student Achievement." The report must include at
least the following information about advisory committee membership:
     (1) the name of each committee member and the date when that member's term expires;
     (2) the method and criteria the school board uses to select committee members; and

   Sec. 7. [120B.299] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section apply to this chapter.
   Subd. 2. Growth. "Growth" compares the difference in a student's achievement score at two or
more distinct points in time.
   Subd. 3. Value added. "Value added" is the amount of achievement a student demonstrates
above an established baseline. The difference between the student's score and the baseline defines
value added.
    Subd. 4. Value-added growth. "Value-added growth" is based on a student's growth score. In
a value-added growth system, the student's first test is the baseline, and the difference between the
student's first and next test scores within a defined period is the measure of value added. Value-added
growth models use student-level data to measure what portion of a student's growth can be explained
by inputs related to the educational environment.
    Subd. 5. Adequate yearly progress. A school or district makes "adequate yearly progress" if, for
every student subgroup under the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act in the school or district, its
proficiency index or other approved adjustments for performance, based on statewide assessment
scores, meets or exceeds federal expectations. To make adequate yearly progress, the school or
district also must satisfy applicable federal requirements related to student attendance, graduation,
and test participation rates.
    Subd. 6. State growth target. (a) "State growth target" is the average year-two assessment scores
for students with similar year-one assessment scores.
    (b) The state growth targets for each grade and subject are benchmarked as follows until the
assessment scale changes:
   (1) beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth target for grades 3 to 8 is
benchmarked to 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school year data;
    (2) beginning in the 2008-2009 school year the state growth target for grade 10 is benchmarked
to 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school year data;
   (3) for the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth target for grade 11 is benchmarked to
2005-2006 school year data; and
    (4) beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, the state growth target for grade 11 is benchmarked
to 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 school year data.
    (c) Each time before the assessment scale changes, a stakeholder group that includes assessment
and evaluation directors and staff and researchers must recommend a new state growth target that
the commissioner must consider when revising standards under section 120B.023, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 7. Low growth. "Low growth" is an assessment score one-half standard deviation below
the state growth target.
   Subd. 8. Medium growth. "Medium growth" is an assessment score within one-half standard
53RD DAY]                                 WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                                     5525

deviation above or below the state growth target.
   Subd. 9. High growth. "High growth" is an assessment score one-half standard deviation or
more above the state growth target.
    Subd. 10. Proficiency. "Proficiency" for purposes of reporting growth on school performance
report cards under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, means those students who, in the previous school
year, scored at or above "meets standards" on the statewide assessments under section 120B.30. Each
year, school performance report cards must separately display: (1) the numbers and percentages of
students who achieved low growth, medium growth, and high growth and achieved proficiency in
the previous school year; and (2) the numbers and percentages of students who achieved low growth,
medium growth, and high growth and did not achieve proficiency in the previous school year.
   Subd. 11. Growth and progress toward proficiency. The categories of low growth, medium
growth, and high growth shall be used to indicate both (1) growth and (2) progress toward
grade-level proficiency that is consistent with subdivision 10.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 120B.30, is amended to read:
    120B.30 STATEWIDE TESTING AND REPORTING SYSTEM.
    Subdivision 1. Statewide testing. (a) The commissioner, with advice from experts with
appropriate technical qualifications and experience and stakeholders, consistent with subdivision
1a, shall include in the comprehensive assessment system, for each grade level to be tested,
state-constructed tests developed from and aligned with the state's required academic standards
under section 120B.021, include multiple choice questions, and be administered annually to all
students in grades 3 through 8 ­   an

available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment. Subdivision
1, paragraph (d), applies to the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 school years only. Minnesota
Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), clause (1), item (ii), is not effective until
July 1, 2010, and the legislature specifically authorizes the number, subject area, grade level,
and consequence of a high school mathematics assessment program; if the legislature does not
authorize the assessment program by July 1, 2010, the graduation-required assessment for diploma
in grade 11 for mathematics under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, paragraph
(c), remains in effect.

the educational implications of changes in districts' demographic profiles over time. Any report
the commissioner disseminates containing summary data on student performance must integrate
student performance and the demographic factors that strongly correlate with that performance.

Indicators of achievement and prior achievement must be based on highly reliable statewide or

not be used to disregard a school's low achievement or to exclude a school from a program to

subdivision 3. The model may be used to advance educators' professional development and
replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs. Data on individual
teachers generated under the model are personnel data under section 13.43. The model must allow
users to:
     (1) report student growth consistent with this paragraph; and
    (2) for all student categories, report and compare aggregated and disaggregated state growth
data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act
and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively, following appropriate reporting
practices to protect nonpublic student data.
   The commissioner must report separate measures of student growth and proficiency, consistent
with this paragraph.

                       . When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2011, must report two core measures indicating the
extent to which current high school graduates are being prepared for postsecondary academic and
career opportunities:
    (1) a preparation measure indicating the number and percentage of high school graduates
in the most recent school year who completed course work important to preparing them for
postsecondary academic and career opportunities, consistent with the core academic subjects
required for admission to Minnesota's public colleges and universities as determined by the Office
of Higher Education under chapter 136A; and
   (2) a rigorous coursework measure indicating the number and percentage of high school
graduates in the most recent school year who successfully completed one or more college-level
advanced placement, international baccalaureate, postsecondary enrollment options including
concurrent enrollment, other rigorous courses of study under section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, or
industry certification courses or programs.
When reporting the core measures under clauses (1) and (2), the commissioner must also analyze
and report separate categories of information using the nine student categories identified under the
federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female,
respectively following appropriate reporting practices to protect nonpublic student data.
    (d) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2014, must report summary data on school safety
and students' engagement and connection at school. The summary data under this paragraph
are separate from and must not be used for any purpose related to measuring or evaluating the
performance of classroom teachers. The commissioner, in consultation with qualified experts on
student engagement and connection and classroom teachers, must identify highly reliable variables
that generate summary data under this paragraph. The summary data may be used at school,

programs or practices are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory
reading progress. The program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, effective,
balanced instruction in all five areas of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary
development, and ­e t­x

                       t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
    (b) "Fluency" is the ability of students to read text with speed, accuracy, and proper expression.
    (c) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
    (d) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships
between written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that
stresses learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and
spelling.

    (e) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning through intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.
    (f) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology enhance the acquiring of vocabulary.
   (g) Nothing in this subdivision limits the authority of a school district to select a school's reading
program or curriculum.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; board composition. Except for the representatives of higher education
and the public, to be eligible for appointment to the Board of Teaching a person must be a teacher
currently teaching in a Minnesota school and fully licensed for the position held and have at least five
years teaching experience in Minnesota, including the two years immediately preceding nomination
and appointment. Each nominee, other than a public nominee, must be selected on the basis of
professional experience and knowledge of teacher education, accreditation, and licensure. The board
must be composed of:
   (1) six teachers who are currently teaching in a Minnesota school or who were teaching at the
time of the appointment and who do not qualify under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision, at least
four of whom must be teaching in a public school;
   (2) one higher education representative, who must be a faculty member preparing teachers;
   (3) one school administrator; and
   (4) three members of the public, two of whom must be present or former members of school
boards.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Vacant position. With the exception of a teacher who retires from teaching during
the course of completing a board term, the position of a member who leaves Minnesota or whose
employment status changes to a category different from that from which appointed is deemed vacant.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.09, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. License and rules. (a) The board must adopt rules to license public school teachers
and interns subject to chapter 14.
    (b) The board must adopt rules requiring a person to successfully complete a skills examination
in reading, writing, and mathematics as a requirement for initial teacher licensure. Such rules must
require college and universities offering a board-approved teacher preparation program to provide
remedial assistance to persons who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination,
including those for whom English is a second language.

    (c) The board must adopt rules to approve teacher preparation programs. The board, upon
the request of a postsecondary student preparing for teacher licensure or a licensed graduate
of a teacher preparation program, shall assist in resolving a dispute between the person and a
postsecondary institution providing a teacher preparation program when the dispute involves an
institution's recommendation for licensure affecting the person or the person's credentials. At the
board's discretion, assistance may include the application of chapter 14.
    (d) The board must provide the leadership and shall adopt rules for the redesign of teacher
education programs to implement a research based, results-oriented curriculum that focuses on the
skills teachers need in order to be effective. The board shall implement new systems of teacher
preparation program evaluation to assure program effectiveness based on proficiency of graduates
in demonstrating attainment of program outcomes.

student volunteers, who are offered the opportunity to provide athletic coaching services or other
extracurricular academic coaching services to a school, regardless of whether any compensation
is paid. In order for an individual to be eligible for employment or to provide the services, the
individual must provide an executed criminal history consent form and a money order or check
payable to either the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension or the school hiring authority, at the
discretion of the school hiring authority, in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension and the school district of conducting the criminal history background
check. A school hiring authority deciding to receive payment may, at its discretion, accept payment
in the form of a negotiable instrument other than a money order or check and shall pay the
superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension directly to conduct the background check.
The superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall conduct the background check by
retrieving criminal history data maintained in the criminal justice information system computers.
A school hiring authority, at its discretion, may decide not to request a criminal history background
check on an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by the State Board of Teaching
or the commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks
to enter a school or its grounds for the purpose of serving as a school volunteer or working as
an independent contractor or student employee. In order for an individual to enter a school or its
grounds under this paragraph when the school hiring authority decides to request a criminal history
background check on the individual, the individual first must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school district
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the school district
of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.­ unless a school hiring authority decides to pay the costs of conducting a background
check under this paragraph. If the school hiring authority pays the costs, the individual who is the
subject of the background check need not pay for it.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from

consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 33. [123B.045] DISTRICT-CREATED SITE-GOVERNED SCHOOLS.
    Subdivision 1. Authority. (a) A school board may approve site-governed schools under this
section by requesting site-governing school proposals. The request for proposals must include what
types of schools or education innovations the board intends to create. A current site may submit a
proposal to create a different model for the site if 60 percent or more of the teachers at the site support
the proposal. A group of licensed district professionals from one or multiple district sites may submit
a proposal. The group submitting the proposal must include parents or other community members
in the development of the proposal. A proposal may request approval for a model of a school not
included in the request for proposal of the board.
    (b) The school board and the applicable bargaining unit representing district employees must
enter into memoranda of understanding specifying how applicable sections of current contracts will
enable the provisions of subdivision 2, clauses (7) and (8), to be implemented.
   (c) Within 60 days of receipt of the application, the school board shall determine whether to
approve, deny, or return the application to the applicants for further information or development.
    (d) Upon approval of the proposal, an agreement between the district and the site council shall
be developed identifying the powers and duties delegated to the site and outlining the details of the
proposal including the provisions of subdivisions 2, 3, and 5. Any powers or duties not specifically
delegated to the school site in the agreement remains with the school board.
    Subd. 2. Roles and responsibilities of site-governed schools. (a) Site-governed schools
approved by the school board have the following autonomy and responsibilities at the discretion
of the site:
    (1) to create the site-governing council of the school. The council shall include teachers,
administrators, parents, students if appropriate, community members, and other representatives of
the community as determined by the site-governing council. Teachers may comprise a majority
of the site-governing council at the option of a majority of the teachers at the site. The number
of members on the site-governing council and the composition shall be included in the proposal
approved by the school board;

    (2) to determine the leadership model for the site including: selecting a principal, operating as
a teacher professional practices model with school leadership functions performed by one or more
teachers or administrators at the school or other model determined by the site;
   (3) to determine the budget for the site and the allocation and expenditure of the revenue based
on provisions of subdivision 3;
   (4) to determine the learning model and organization of the school consistent with the application
approved by the school board;
   (5) to select and develop its curriculum and determine formative and summative assessment
practices;
    (6) to set policies for the site including student promotion, attendance, discipline, graduation
requirements which may exceed the school board standards, and other such rules as approved by
the school board consistent with the mission, goals, and learning program of the school site;
    (7) to determine the length of the school day and year and employee work rules covered by the
terms and conditions of the employment contract;
     (8) to select teachers and other staff consistent with current law and collective bargaining
agreements and memoranda of understanding provided for in subdivision 1, paragraph (b). At least
70 percent of the teachers must be selected by the site prior to final approval of the agreement.
Prior to requesting the district to employ staff not currently employed by the district, the site must
first select current district staff including those on requested and unrequested leave as provided for
in sections 122A.40 and 122A.41. The school board shall be the legal employer of all staff at the
site and all teachers and other staff members of the applicable bargaining units. Teachers and other
employees may be required to sign an individual work agreement with the site-governing council
committing themselves to the mission and learning program of the school and the requirements of
the site-governing council; and
   (9) to fulfill other provisions as agreed to by the district and site-governing council.
  (b) If a self-governed school created under this section is supervised by a principal, that principal
must be licensed, consistent with section 123B.147, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 3. Revenue to self-governed school. (a) The revenue that shall be allocated by the site
includes the general education revenue generated by the students at the site from state, local, and
private sources, referendum revenue, federal revenue from the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Carl Perkins Act, and other federal programs as
agreed to by the school board and site council.
    (b) The district may retain an administrative fee for managing the federal programs, private
revenues, and general administrative functions including school board, superintendent, district legal
counsel, finance, accountability and self-governed school contract oversight, facilities maintenance,
districtwide special education programs, and other such services as agreed to by the site and school
board. The administrative fee shall be included in the agreement.
    (c) As part of the agreement, the district may provide specific services for the site and may
specify the amount to be paid for each service and retain the revenues for that amount. The formula
or procedures for determining the amount of revenue to be allocated to the site each year shall be

consistent with this subdivision and incorporated in the site budget annually following a timeline and
process that is included in the agreement with the school board. The site is responsible for allocating
revenue for all staff at the site and for the other provisions of the agreement with the district board.
   (d) All unspent revenue shall be carried over to following years for the sole use of the site.
    Subd. 4. Exemption from statutes and rules. Except as outlined in this section, site-governed
schools established under this section are exempt from and subject to the same laws and rules as
are chartered schools under section 124D.10, except that the schools shall be subject to chapters 13,
13D, and 179A, and sections 122A.40, 122A.41, 122A.50, and 122A.51.
   Subd. 5. Performance standards. (a) The school board and the site council shall include in the
agreement performance standards and expectations that shall include at least the following:
   (1) student achievement targets on multiple indicators including either a growth model or
value-added growth model;
    (2) the criteria and process to be followed if it is determined that the site failed to comply with
district oversight and accountability requirements as outlined in the agreement; and
   (3) other performance provisions as agreed to.
    (b) All agreements shall be filed with the commissioner. The initial agreement shall be for up
to three years, shall be reviewed annually, and may be renewed by the district board for additional
terms of up to five years based on the performance of the school.
    Subd. 6. Board termination of self-governed school authority. (a) The district board may
terminate the agreement for one or more of the following reasons:
   (1) failure of the site to meet the provisions specified in the agreement in subdivision 5;
   (2) violations of law; or
   (3) other good cause shown.
    (b) Site-governed schools that are terminated or not renewed for reasons other than cause may
request to convert to charter school status as provided for in section 124D.10 and, if chartered by
the board, shall become the owner of all materials, supplies, and equipment purchased during the
period the school was a site-governed school.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent

upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
      (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
      (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
      (4) make reports required by the commissioner; and

learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation standard or the grade progression
requirement of the enrolling district as described in the provider's online course syllabus meets
the corresponding graduation requirements applicable to the student in the enrolling district. If the
enrolling district does not agree that the course or program meets its graduation requirements, then:
    (1) the enrolling district must make available an explanation of its decision to the student, the
student's parent, and the online provider; and
   (2) the online provider may make available a response to the enrolling district, showing how the
course or program meets the graduation requirements of the enrolling district.

    (d) An online learning provider may limit enrollment if the provider's school board or board of
directors adopts by resolution specific standards for accepting and rejecting students' applications.
  (e) An enrolling district may reduce an online learning student's regular classroom instructional
membership in proportion to the student's membership in online learning courses.
    (f) The online provider must report or make available information on an individual student's
progress and accumulated credit to the student, the student's parent, and the enrolling district in a
manner specified by the commissioner unless the enrolling district and the online provider agree
to a different form of notice and notify the commissioner. The enrolling district must designate
a contact person to help facilitate and monitor the student's academic progress and accumulated
credits towards graduation.

learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the reporting requirements or review criteria
under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district is a full-time online provider. A teacher with a
Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to enrolled students receiving online
learning from an enrolling district. The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts
with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning.

commissioner written assurance that: (1) all courses meet state academic standards; and (2) the
online learning curriculum, instruction, and assessment, expectations for actual teacher-contact
time or other student-to-teacher communication, and academic support meet nationally recognized
professional standards and are described as such in an online course syllabus that meets the
commissioner's requirements. Once an online learning provider is approved under this paragraph,
all of its online learning course offerings are eligible for payment under this section unless a course
is successfully challenged by an enrolling district or the department under paragraph (b).
    (b) An enrolling district may challenge the validity of a course offered by an online learning
provider. The department must review such challenges based on the certification procedures under
paragraph (a). The department may initiate its own review of the validity of an online learning course
offered by an online learning provider.
    (c) The department may collect a fee not to exceed $250 for certifying online learning providers
or $50 per course for reviewing a challenge by an enrolling district.
   (d) The department must develop, publish, and maintain a list of approved online learning
providers and online learning courses and programs that it has reviewed and certified.

approved as a sponsor under this paragraph must submit a proposal to the commissioner that includes
the provisions of paragraph (c) and a five-year financial plan. Such authorizers shall consider and

it solicits, considers, or approves to any single curriculum, learning program, or method.
    (c) An eligible authorizer under this subdivision must apply to the commissioner for approval
as an authorizer before submitting any affidavit to the commissioner to charter a school. The
application for approval as a charter school authorizer must demonstrate the applicant's ability to
implement the procedures and satisfy the criteria for chartering a school under this section. The
commissioner must approve or disapprove an application within 60 business days of the application
deadline. If the commissioner disapproves the application, the commissioner must notify the
applicant of the deficiencies and the applicant then has 20 business days to address the deficiencies
to the commissioner's satisfaction. Failing to address the deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction makes an applicant ineligible to be an authorizer. The commissioner, in establishing
criteria for approval, must consider the applicant's:
   (1) capacity and infrastructure;
   (2) application criteria and process;
   (3) contracting process;
   (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
   (5) renewal criteria and processes.

    (2) a description of the capacity of the organization to serve as a sponsor, including the personnel
who will perform the sponsoring duties, their qualifications, the amount of time they will be assigned
to this responsibility, and the financial resources allocated by the organization to this responsibility;

governing its educational program, controlling its funds, and making school management decisions;
   (5) the process to be used for providing ongoing oversight of the school consistent with the
contract expectations specified in clause (4) that assures that the schools chartered are complying
with both the provisions of applicable law and rules, and with the contract;
   (6) the process for making decisions regarding the renewal or termination of the school's charter
based on evidence that demonstrates the academic, organizational, and financial competency of the
school, including its success in increasing student achievement and meeting the goals of the charter
school agreement; and
    (7) an assurance specifying that the organization is committed to serving as a sponsor for the
full five-year term.
   A disapproved applicant under this paragraph may resubmit an application during a future
application period.
   (e) The authorizer must participate in department-approved training.
    (f) An authorizer that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2011, to
the commissioner for approval, under paragraph (c), to continue as an authorizer under this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, an authorizer that fails to submit a timely application is ineligible
to charter a school.
    (g) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner
and form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more
frequently at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator,
charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action.

    (h) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; or
    (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer.

that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.
    (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as
a cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must

a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according
to the school's articles and bylaws under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must

school board election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must
comply with chapter 13D.

    (d
     ­­) (e) Upon the request of an individual, the charter school must make available in a timely
fashion the minutes of meetings of the board of directors, and of members and committees
having any board-delegated authority; financial statements showing all operations and transactions
affecting income, surplus, and deficit during the school's last annual accounting period; and a
balance sheet summarizing assets and liabilities on the closing date of the accounting period. A
charter school also must post on its official Web site information identifying its authorizer and
indicate how to contact that authorizer and include that same information about its authorizer in
other school materials that it makes available to the public.
    (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one
licensed teacher employed at the school or a licensed teacher providing instruction under a contact
between the charter school and a cooperative; (ii) the parent or legal guardian of a student enrolled
in the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed by the charter
school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher majority
board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the chief
administrator are ex-officio nonvoting board members. Board bylaws shall outline the process and
procedures for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may
change its governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
      (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.

authorizer. Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed
to the commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.

    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict
exists when:
     (1) the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
     (2) the immediate family of the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
     (3) the partner of the board member, employee, officer, or agent; or
     (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3),
has a financial or other interest in the entity with which the charter school is contracting. A violation
of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.

(c). The agreed upon fee structure must be stated in the charter school contract.
     (c) The fee that each charter school pays to an authorizer each year is the greater of:
     (1) the basic formula allowance for that year; or
     (2) the lesser of:
     (i) the maximum fee factor times the basic formula allowance for that year; or
     (ii) the fee factor times the basic formula allowance for that year times the charter school's
adjusted marginal cost pupil units for that year. The fee factor equals .005 in fiscal year 2010, .01
in fiscal year 2011, .013 in fiscal year 2012, and .015 in fiscal years 2013 and later. The maximum

fee factor equals 1.5 in fiscal year 2010, 2.0 in fiscal year 2011, 3.0 in fiscal year 2012, and 4.0 in
fiscal years 2013 and later.
   (d) The department and any charter school it charters must not assess or pay a fee under
paragraphs (b) and (c).
    (e) For the preoperational planning period, the authorizer may assess a charter school a fee equal
to the basic formula allowance.
    (f) By September 30 of each year, an authorizer shall submit to the commissioner a statement of
expenditures related to chartering activities during the previous school year ending June 30. A copy
of the statement shall be given to all schools chartered by the authorizer.
    Subd. 16. Transportation. (a) A charter school after its first fiscal year of operation by March
1 of each fiscal year and a charter school by July 1 of its first fiscal year of operation must notify
the district in which the school is located and the Department of Education if it will provide its own
transportation or use the transportation services of the district in which it is located for the fiscal
year.
   (b) If a charter school elects to provide transportation for pupils, the transportation must be
provided by the charter school within the district in which the charter school is located. The state
must pay transportation aid to the charter school according to section 124D.11, subdivision 2.
    For pupils who reside outside the district in which the charter school is located, the charter school
is not required to provide or pay for transportation between the pupil's residence and the border of
the district in which the charter school is located. A parent may be reimbursed by the charter school
for costs of transportation from the pupil's residence to the border of the district in which the charter
school is located if the pupil is from a family whose income is at or below the poverty level, as
determined by the federal government. The reimbursement may not exceed the pupil's actual cost
of transportation or 15 cents per mile traveled, whichever is less. Reimbursement may not be paid
for more than 250 miles per week.
   At the time a pupil enrolls in a charter school, the charter school must provide the parent or
guardian with information regarding the transportation.
    (c) If a charter school does not elect to provide transportation, transportation for pupils enrolled
at the school must be provided by the district in which the school is located, according to sections
123B.88, subdivision 6, and 124D.03, subdivision 8, for a pupil residing in the same district in
which the charter school is located. Transportation may be provided by the district in which the
school is located, according to sections 123B.88, subdivision 6, and 124D.03, subdivision 8, for
a pupil residing in a different district. If the district provides the transportation, the scheduling of
routes, manner and method of transportation, control and discipline of the pupils, and any other
matter relating to the transportation of pupils under this paragraph shall be within the sole discretion,
control, and management of the district.
    Subd. 17. Leased space. A charter school may lease space from ­                a an independent or special

constructed as a school facility. The department must review and approve or disapprove leases in
a timely manner. ­I­

    Subd. 17a. Affiliated nonprofit building corporation. (a) Before a charter school may organize
an affiliated nonprofit building corporation (i) to renovate or purchase an existing facility to serve
as a school or (ii) to construct a new school facility, an authorizer must submit an affidavit to the
commissioner for approval in the form and manner the commissioner prescribes, and consistent
with paragraphs (b) and (c) or (d).
      (b) An affiliated nonprofit building corporation under this subdivision must:
   (1) be incorporated under section 317A and comply with applicable Internal Revenue Service
regulations;
    (2) submit to the commissioner each fiscal year a list of current board members and a copy of
its annual audit; and
      (3) comply with government data practices law under chapter 13.
An affiliated nonprofit building corporation must not serve as the leasing agent for property or
facilities it does not own. A charter school that leases a facility from an affiliated nonprofit building
corporation that does not own the leased facility is ineligible to receive charter school lease aid. The
state is immune from liability resulting from a contract between a charter school and an affiliated
nonprofit building corporation.
   (c) A charter school may organize an affiliated nonprofit building corporation to renovate or
purchase an existing facility to serve as a school if the charter school:
   (1) has been operating for at least five consecutive school years and the school's charter has been
renewed for a five-year term;
    (2) has had a net positive unreserved general fund balance as of June 30 in the preceding five
fiscal years;
      (3) has a long-range strategic and financial plan;
      (4) completes a feasibility study of available buildings; and
   (5) documents sustainable enrollment projections and the need to use an affiliated building
corporation to renovate or purchase an existing facility to serve as a school.
   (d) A charter school may organize an affiliated nonprofit building corporation to construct a new
school facility if the charter school:
      (1) demonstrates the lack of facilities available to serve as a school;
      (2) has been operating for at least eight consecutive school years;
      (3) has had a net positive unreserved general fund balance as of June 30 in the preceding eight

fiscal years;
     (4) completes a feasibility study of facility options;
   (5) has a long-range strategic and financial plan that includes sustainable enrollment projections
and demonstrates the need for constructing a new school facility; and

authorizer can identify and effectively resolve those circumstances causing the previous authorizer

ceases serving students, the commissioner shall withhold the estimated state aid owed the school.
The charter school board of directors and authorizer must submit to the commissioner a closure
plan under chapter 308A or 317A, and financial information about the school's liabilities and assets.
After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an audit of pupil counts, documentation
of lease expenditures, and monitoring of special education expenditures, the commissioner may
release cash withheld and may continue regular payments up to the current year payment percentages
if further amounts are owed. If, based on audits and monitoring, the school received state aid in
excess of the amount owed, the commissioner shall retain aid withheld sufficient to eliminate the
aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations prior to, or at the end of, a school year,
notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary final payments may be made after
receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of special education expenditures, ­                                an­d

documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of Uniform Financial Accounting and
Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year of operation. Final payment may be
made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section 123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount
of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If, within the timeline under section 471.425, a charter school fails to pay the state of
Minnesota, a school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative after receiving an
undisputed invoice for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid
sufficient to satisfy the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative. An interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or education cooperative shall notify the commissioner
when a charter school fails to pay an undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it
received the original invoice.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.

     ­­) (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the
department and a quarterly report to the Department of Education. The report must list each student
by grade, show the student's start and end dates, if any, with the charter school, and for any student
participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar

schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in
the form and manner requested by the department.

demonstrate to the commissioner that it will:
    (1) provide a program of instruction that permits pupils to receive instruction throughout the
entire year; and
    (2) develop and maintain a separate record system that, for purposes of section 126C.05, permits
identification of membership attributable to pupils participating in the program. The record system
and identification must ensure that the program will not have the effect of increasing the total average
daily membership attributable to an individual pupil as a result of a learning year program. The
record system must include the date the pupil originally enrolled in a learning year program, the
pupil's grade level, the date of each grade promotion, the average daily membership generated in
each grade level, the number of credits or standards earned, and the number needed to graduate.
    (d) A student who has not completed a school district's graduation requirements may continue
to enroll in courses the student must complete in order to graduate until the student satisfies the
district's graduation requirements or the student is 21 years old, whichever comes first.

    (1) the pupil's learning objectives and experiences, including courses or credits the pupil plans
to complete each year and, for a secondary pupil, the graduation requirements the student must
complete;
      (2) the assessment measurements used to evaluate a pupil's objectives;
      (3) requirements for grade level or other appropriate progression; and
   (4) for pupils generating more than one average daily membership in a given grade, an indication
of which objectives were unmet.
The plan may be modified to conform to district schedule changes. The district may not modify the
plan if the modification would result in delaying the student's time of graduation.

pupil in the district to 1,020 for a secondary pupil; (ii) the greater of 935 hours or the number of
hours required for a full-time elementary pupil in the district to 935 for an elementary pupil in
grades 1 through 6; and (iii) the greater of 425 hours or the number of hours required for a full-time
kindergarten student without a disability in the district to 425 for a kindergarten student without a
disability. Hours that occur after the close of the instructional year in June shall be attributable to the
following fiscal year. A kindergarten student must not be counted as more than 1.2 pupils in average
daily membership under this subdivision. A student in grades 1 through 12 must not be counted as
more than 1.2 pupils in average daily membership under this subdivision.

   Sec. 58. [127A.70] MINNESOTA P-20 EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; membership. A P-20 education partnership is established to
create a seamless system of education that maximizes achievements of all students, from early
childhood through elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, while promoting the
efficient use of financial and human resources. The partnership shall consist of major statewide
educational groups or constituencies or noneducational statewide organizations with a stated
interest in P-20 education. The initial membership of the partnership includes the members serving
on the Minnesota P-16 Education Partnership and four legislators appointed as follows:
    (1) one senator from the majority party and one senator from the minority party, appointed by
the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration; and
  (2) one member of the house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house and one
member appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives.
    The chair of the P-16 education partnership must convene the first meeting of the P-20
partnership. Prospective members may be nominated by any partnership member and new members
will be added with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the partnership. The partnership will
also seek input from nonmember organizations whose expertise can help inform the partnership's
work.
    Partnership members shall be represented by the chief executives, presidents, or other formally
designated leaders of their respective organizations, or their designees. The partnership shall meet
at least three times during each calendar year.
    Subd. 2. Powers and duties; report. The partnership shall develop recommendations to the
governor and the legislature designed to maximize the achievement of all P-20 students while
promoting the efficient use of state resources, thereby helping the state realize the maximum value
for its investment. These recommendations may include, but are not limited to, strategies, policies,
or other actions focused on:

   (1) improving the quality of and access to education at all points from preschool through graduate
education;
    (2) improving preparation for, and transitions to, postsecondary education and work; and
   (3) ensuring educator quality by creating rigorous standards for teacher recruitment, teacher
preparation, induction and mentoring of beginning teachers, and continuous professional
development for career teachers.
    By January 15 of each year, the partnership shall submit a report to the governor and to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction
over P-20 education policy and finance that summarizes the partnership's progress in meeting its
goals and identifies the need for any draft legislation when necessary to further the goals of the
partnership to maximize student achievement while promoting efficient use of resources.
   Subd. 3. Expiration. Notwithstanding section 15.059, subdivision 5, the partnership is
permanent and does not expire.
    Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 471.975, is amended to read:
    471.975 MAY PAY DIFFERENTIAL OF RESERVE ON ACTIVE DUTY.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, or
other political subdivision may pay to each eligible member of the National Guard or other reserve
component of the armed forces of the United States an amount equal to the difference between the
member's ­ b­
            a­i­ base active duty military salary and the salary the member would be paid as an active
             s­c
political subdivision employee, including any adjustments the member would have received if not
on leave of absence. This payment may be made only to a person whose ­        b­
                                                                               a­
                                                                                s­c
                                                                                 i­ base active duty
military salary is less than the salary the person would be paid as an active political subdivision
employee. Back pay authorized by this section may be paid in a lump sum. Payment under this
section must not extend beyond four years from the date the employee reported for active service,
plus any additional time the employee may be legally required to serve.
    (b) Subject to the limits under paragraph (g), each school district shall pay to each eligible
member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the armed forces of the United States
an amount equal to the difference between the member's b              ­­a­s­c
                                                                           i­ base active duty military salary
and the salary the member would be paid as an active school district employee, including any
adjustments the member would have received if not on leave of absence. The pay differential must
be based on a comparison between the member's daily base rate of active duty pay, calculated by
dividing the member's base military monthly salary by the number of paid days in the month, and
the member's daily rate of pay for the member's school district salary, calculated by dividing the
member's total school district salary by the number of contract days. The member's salary as a school
district employee must include the member's basic salary and any additional salary the member
earns from the school district for cocurricular and extracurricular activities. The differential payment
under this paragraph must be the difference between the daily base rates of military pay times the
number of school district contract days the member misses because of military active duty. This
payment may be made only to a person whose ­         b­

the date the employee reported for active service, plus any additional time the employee may be
legally required to serve.
    (c) An eligible member of the reserve components of the armed forces of the United States is a
reservist or National Guard member who was an employee of a political subdivision at the time the
member reported for active service on or after May 29, 2003, or who is on active service on May
29, 2003.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) and elsewhere in Minnesota Statutes, a statutory or home
rule charter city, county, town, or other political subdivision has total discretion regarding employee
benefit continuation for a member who reports for active service and the terms and conditions of
any benefit.
    (e) A school district must continue the employee's enrollment in health and dental coverage, and
the employer contribution toward that coverage, until the employee is covered by health and dental
coverage provided by the armed forces. If the employee had elected dependent coverage for health
or dental coverage as of the time that the employee reported for active service, a school district must
offer the employee the option to continue the dependent coverage at the employee's own expense.
A school district must permit the employee to continue participating in any pretax account in which
the employee participated when the employee reported for active service, to the extent of employee
pay available for that purpose.
   (f) For purposes of this section, "active service" has the meaning given in section 190.05,
subdivision 5, but excludes service performed exclusively for purposes of:
   (1) basic combat training, advanced individual training, annual training, and periodic inactive
duty training;
   (2) special training periodically made available to reserve members; and
   (3) service performed in accordance with section 190.08, subdivision 3.
    (g) A school district making payments under paragraph (b) shall place a sum equal to any
difference between the amount of salary that would have been paid to the employee who is
receiving the payments and the amount of salary being paid to substitutes for that employee into
a special fund that must be used to pay or partially pay the deployed employee's payments under
paragraph (b). A school district is required to pay only this amount to the deployed school district
employee.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
members of the National Guard and other reserve components of the United States armed forces
serving in active military service on or after that date.
  Sec. 60. IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS COURSEWORK MEASURES RELATED TO
STUDENT PERFORMANCE.
    To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (2), and to help parents and members of the public better understand
the reported data, the commissioner of education must convene a group of recognized and qualified
experts and interested stakeholders, including parents and teachers among other stakeholders,
to develop a model projecting anticipated performance of each high school on preparation and

rigorous coursework measures that compares the school with similar schools. The model must use
information about entering high school students based on particular background characteristics
that are predictive of differing rates of college readiness. These characteristics include grade 8
achievement levels, high school student mobility, high school student attendance, and the size
of each entering ninth grade class. The group of experts and stakeholders may examine other
characteristics not part of the prediction model including the nine student categories identified
under the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, and two student gender categories of male and
female, respectively. The commissioner annually must use the predicted level of entering students'
performance to provide a context for interpreting graduating students' actual performance. The
group convened under this section expires June 30, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2011.
  Sec. 61. IMPLEMENTING MEASURES FOR ASSESSING SCHOOL SAFETY AND
STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTION AT SCHOOL .
    (a) To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision
3, paragraph (d), the commissioner of education, in consultation with interested stakeholders,
including parents and teachers among other stakeholders, must convene a group of recognized and
qualified experts on student engagement and connection and classroom teachers currently teaching
in Minnesota schools to:
    (1) identify highly reliable variables of student engagement and connection that may include
student attendance, home support for learning, and student participation in out-of-school activities,
among other variables; and
   (2) determine how to report "safety" in order to comply with federal law.
    (b) The commissioner must submit a written report and all the group's working papers to the
education committees of the house of representatives and senate by February 15, 2010, presenting
the group's responses to paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2). The commissioner must submit a second,
related report to the education committees of the legislature by February 15, 2013, indicating the
content and analysis of and the format for reporting any data collected under Minnesota Statutes,
section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (d). The group convened under this section expires
December 31, 2013.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2014.
   Sec. 62. HIGH SCHOOL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM; RECOMMENDATIONS.
   A college and career-readiness workgroup on a comprehensive high school assessment
and accountability system that aligns to college and career readiness headed jointly by the
Minnesota Department of Education and the University of Minnesota must evaluate and make
recommendations on:
    (1) the design of Minnesota's high school assessment system for ensuring that students are
college and career ready upon graduation from high school;
   (2) the levels of accountability that will be incorporated into this assessment system for the state,
5584                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [53RD DAY

district, school, and student;
    (3) the statewide mechanism for accountability at these various levels. The accountability system
must be consistent and coherent enough to ensure that all students are moving toward college and
career readiness, but also flexible enough to recognize the varied needs of different students;
   (4) a plan for Minnesota postsecondary institutions to evaluate these assessments for possible
use in admissions, placement, and scholarship opportunities as the system is implemented; and
    (5) the implementation timeline that will ensure that this college and career-ready anchor
assessment system is put in place in Minnesota.
    This workgroup must report its recommendations to the commissioner of education by
December 31, 2009. The commissioner must provide this report and any related commentary on

   (b) A "student with a disability" or a "pupil with a disability" has the same meaning as a "child
with a disability" under section 125A.02.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 121A.41, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
      Subd. 10. Suspension. "Suspension" means an action by the school administration, under rules
promulgated by the school board, prohibiting a pupil from attending school for a period of no
more than ten school days. If a suspension is longer than five days, the suspending administrator
must provide the superintendent with a reason for the longer suspension. This definition does
not apply to dismissal from school for one school day or less, except as provided in federal
law for a student with a disability. Each suspension action may include a readmission plan.
The readmission plan shall include, where appropriate, a provision for implementing alternative
educational services upon readmission and may not be used to extend the current suspension.
Consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5, the readmission plan must not obligate a parent
to provide a sympathomimetic medication for the parent's child as a condition of readmission. The
school administration may not impose consecutive suspensions against the same pupil for the same
course of conduct, or incident of misconduct, except where the pupil will create an immediate
and substantial danger to self or to surrounding persons or property, or where the district is in
the process of initiating an expulsion, in which case the school administration may extend the
suspension to a total of 15 school days. ­                            In­­­

      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 121A.43, is amended to read:
      121A.43 EXCLUSION AND EXPULSION OF PUPILS WITH A DISABILITY.
   (a) Consistent with federal law governing days of removal and section 121A.46, school
personnel may suspend a child with a disability. When a child with a disability has been suspended

for more than five consecutive school days or 10 cumulative school days in the same school year,
and that suspension does not involve a recommendation for expulsion or exclusion or other change
of placement under federal law, relevant members of the child's individualized education program
team, including at least one of the child's teachers, shall meet and determine the extent to which
the child needs services in order to continue to participate in the general education curriculum,
although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting the goals in the child's individualized
education program. That meeting must occur as soon as possible, but no more than 10 days after
the sixth consecutive day of suspension or the tenth cumulative day of suspension has elapsed.
    (b) A dismissal for one school day or less is a day or a partial day of suspension if the child with
a disability does not receive regular or special education instruction during that dismissal period.
The notice requirements under section 121A.46 do not apply to a dismissal of one day or less.
   (c) A child with a disability shall be provided alternative educational services to the extent a
suspension exceeds five consecutive school days.
     (d) Before initiating an expulsion or exclusion under sections 121A.40 to 121A.56, the district,
relevant members of the child's individualized education program team, and the child's parent
shall, consistent with federal law, determine whether the child's behavior was caused by or had a
direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability and whether the child's conduct was a
direct result of a failure to implement the child's individualized education program. When a p                                                    ­­

PROGRAMS.
   (a) At the beginning of each school year, each school district shall have in effect, for each child
with a disability, an individualized education program.
   (b) As defined in this section, every district must ensure the following:
    (1) all students with disabilities are provided the special instruction and services which are
appropriate to their needs. Where the individual education plan team has determined appropriate
goals and objectives based on the student's needs, including the extent to which the student can
be included in the least restrictive environment, and where there are essentially equivalent and
effective instruction, related services, or assistive technology devices available to meet the student's
needs, cost to the district may be among the factors considered by the team in choosing how to
provide the appropriate services, instruction, or devices that are to be made part of the student's
individual education plan. The individual education plan team shall consider and may authorize
services covered by medical assistance according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 26. The
student's needs and the special education instruction and services to be provided must be agreed
upon through the development of an individual education plan. The plan must address the student's
need to develop skills to live and work as independently as possible within the community. The
individual education plan team must consider positive behavioral interventions, strategies, and
supports that address behavior for children with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. B ­y­ During grade 9 ­  o­r­

for transition from secondary services to postsecondary education and training, employment,
community participation, recreation, and leisure and home living. In developing the plan, districts
must inform parents of the full range of transitional goals and related services that should be
considered. The plan must include a statement of the needed transition services, including a
statement of the interagency responsibilities or linkages or both before secondary services are
concluded;
   (2) children with a disability under age five and their families are provided special instruction
and services appropriate to the child's level of functioning and needs;

    (3) children with a disability and their parents or guardians are guaranteed procedural safeguards
and the right to participate in decisions involving identification, assessment including assistive
technology assessment, and educational placement of children with a disability;
    (4) eligibility and needs of children with a disability are determined by an initial assessment
or reassessment, which may be completed using existing data under United States Code, title 20,
section 33, et seq.;
    (5) to the maximum extent appropriate, children with a disability, including those in public or
private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and
that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with a disability from the
regular educational environment occurs only when and to the extent that the nature or severity of
the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services cannot
be achieved satisfactorily;
    (6) in accordance with recognized professional standards, testing and evaluation materials, and
procedures used for the purposes of classification and placement of children with a disability are
selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory; and
   (7) the rights of the child are protected when the parents or guardians are not known or not
available, or the child is a ward of the state.

   (b
    ­­) (c) For paraprofessionals employed to work in programs for students with disabilities, the
school board in each district shall ensure that:
    (1) before or immediately upon employment, each paraprofessional develops sufficient
knowledge and skills in emergency procedures, building orientation, roles and responsibilities,
confidentiality, vulnerability, and reportability, among other things, to begin meeting the needs of
the students with whom the paraprofessional works;
    (2) annual training opportunities are available to enable the paraprofessional to continue
to further develop the knowledge and skills that are specific to the students with whom the
paraprofessional works, including understanding disabilities, following lesson plans, and
implementing follow-up instructional procedures and activities; and
    (3) a districtwide process obligates each paraprofessional to work under the ongoing direction
of a licensed teacher and, where appropriate and possible, the supervision of a school nurse.

   Subd. 3a. Additional requirements for prior written notice. In addition to federal law
requirements, a prior written notice shall:
   (1) inform the parent that except for the initial placement of a child in special education, the
school district will proceed with its proposal for the child's placement or for providing special
education services unless the child's parent notifies the district of an objection within 14 days of
when the district sends the prior written notice to the parent; and
   (2) state that a parent who objects to a proposal or refusal in the prior written notice may request
a conciliation conference under subdivision 7 or another alternative dispute resolution procedure
under subdivision 8 or 9.

    Subd. 6. Dispute resolution processes; generally. Parties are encouraged to resolve disputes
over the identification, evaluation, educational placement, manifestation determination, interim
alternative educational placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child
with a disability through conciliation, mediation, facilitated team meetings, or other alternative
process. All dispute resolution options are voluntary on the part of the parent and must not be used
to deny or delay the right to a due process hearing. All dispute resolution processes under this
section are provided at no cost to the parent.
     Subd. 7. Conciliation conference. A parent must have an opportunity to meet with appropriate
district staff in at least one conciliation conference if the parent objects to any proposal of which the
parent receives notice under subdivision 2         ­ 3a. ­I­ f­­h

hold a conciliation conference within ten calendar days from the date the district receives a parent's
objection to a proposal or refusal in the prior written notice. Except as provided in this section, all
discussions held during a conciliation conference are confidential and are not admissible in a due
process hearing. Within five school days after the final conciliation conference, the district must
prepare and provide to the parent a conciliation conference memorandum that describes the district's
final proposed offer of service. This memorandum is admissible in evidence in any subsequent
proceeding.
    Subd. 8. Voluntary dispute resolution options. In addition to offering at least one conciliation
conference, a district must inform a parent of other dispute resolution processes, including at least
mediation and facilitated team meetings. The fact that an alternative dispute resolution process
was used is admissible in evidence at any subsequent proceeding. State-provided mediators and
team meeting facilitators shall not be subpoenaed to testify at a due process hearing or civil action
under federal special education law nor are any records of mediators or state-provided team meeting
facilitators accessible to the parties.
    Subd. 9. Mediation. Mediation is a dispute resolution process that involves a neutral party
provided by the state to assist a parent and a district in resolving disputes over the identification,
evaluation, educational placement, manifestation determination, interim alternative educational
placement, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability. A
mediation process is available as an informal alternative to a due process hearing but must not be
used to deny or postpone the opportunity of a parent or district to obtain a due process hearing.
Mediation is voluntary for all parties. All mediation discussions are confidential and inadmissible
in evidence in any subsequent proceeding, unless the:
      (1) parties expressly agree otherwise;
      (2) evidence is otherwise available; or
      (3) evidence is offered to prove bias or prejudice of a witness.

(a) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a due process hearing regarding a
proposal or refusal to initiate or change that child's evaluation, individualized education program,
or educational placement, or to provide a free appropriate public education.
    (b) The parent shall include in the hearing request the name of the child, the address of the child's
residence, the name of the school the child attends, a description of the child's problem relating to
the proposed or refused initiation or change, including facts relating to the problem, and a proposed
resolution of the problem to the extent known and available to the parents at the time.
     (c) A parent or a school district may file a written request for a hearing under United States Code,
title 20, section 1415, paragraph (k).
    (d) A parent or school district filing a request for a hearing under this subdivision must provide
the request to the other party and a copy of the request to the department. Upon receiving a request
for a hearing, the department shall give to the child's parent a copy of the procedural safeguards
notice available to a parent under federal regulations.
    (e)(1) If the parent of a child with a disability files a written request for a hearing, and the
school district has not previously sent a written notice to the parent under subdivision 3a, regarding
the subject matter of the hearing request, the school district shall, within ten days of receiving the
hearing request, send to the child's parent a written explanation of why the school district proposed
or refused to take the action raised in the hearing request. The explanation must include a description
of other options that the individualized education program team considered and the reason why those
options were rejected; a description of each evaluation procedure, assessment, record, or report that
the school district used as the basis for the proposed or refused action; and a description of the
factors that are relevant to the school district's proposal or refusal. A response by a school district

for a hearing is insufficient under clause (2) of this paragraph; and
    (2) a hearing may not occur until the party requesting the hearing files a request that meets the
requirements of paragraph (b). The request under paragraph (b) is considered sufficient unless the
party receiving the request notifies the hearing officer and the other party in writing within 15 days of
receiving the request that the receiving party believes the request does not meet the requirements of
paragraph (b). Within five days of receiving a notice under this subdivision, the hearing officer shall
determine whether the request meets the requirements under paragraph (b) and notify the parties.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (e), clause (1), the party receiving a request for a hearing
shall send to the party requesting the hearing a written response that addresses the issues raised in
the hearing request within ten days of receiving the request.
    Subd. 15. Prehearing conference. A prehearing conference must be held within five business
days of the date the commissioner appoints the hearing officer. The hearing officer must initiate the
prehearing conference which may be conducted in person, at a location within the district, or by
telephone. The hearing officer must create a written verbatim record of the prehearing conference
which is available to either party upon request. At the prehearing conference, the hearing officer
must:
   (1) identify the questions that must be answered to resolve the dispute and eliminate claims and
complaints that are without merit;
      (2) set a scheduling order for the hearing and additional prehearing activities;
    (3) determine if the hearing can be disposed of without an evidentiary hearing and, if so, establish
the schedule and procedure for doing so; and
   (4) establish the management, control, and location of the hearing to ensure its fair, efficient,
and effective disposition.
     Subd. 16. Burden of proof. The burden of proof at a due process hearing is on the ­                                                       d­s

      i­g­ ensure that not later than 45 days after the 30-day period or the adjusted time periods under
federal regulations expire, the hearing officer reaches a final decision in the due process hearing and
transmits a copy of the decision to each party. A hearing officer, at the request of either party, may
grant specific extensions of time beyond the 45-day period under subdivision 18. The hearing officer
must conduct the oral arguments in a hearing at a time and place that is reasonably convenient to
the parents and child involved. A hearing officer is encouraged to accelerate the time line to 30 days
for a child under the age of three whose needs change rapidly and who requires quick resolution

    Subd. 21. Compensatory educational services. The hearing officer may require the resident or
responsible district to provide compensatory educational services to the child if the hearing officer
finds that the district has not offered or made available to the child a free appropriate public education
in the least restrictive environment and the child suffered a loss of educational benefit. Such services
take the form of direct and indirect special education and related services designed to address any
loss of educational benefit that may have occurred. The hearing officer's finding must be based on a
present determination of whether the child has suffered a loss of educational benefit.

    (3) is needed to administer an authorized health-related service or procedure; or
    (4) is needed to physically escort a child when the child does not resist or the child's resistance
is minimal.
   (d) "Positive behavioral interventions and supports" means interventions and strategies to
improve the school environment and teach children the skills to behave appropriately.
    (e) "Restrictive procedures" means the use of physical holding or seclusion in an emergency.
    (f) "Seclusion" means confining a child alone in a room from which egress is barred. Removing

not seclusion.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2011.
   Sec. 11. [125A.0942] STANDARDS FOR RESTRICTIVE PROCEDURES.
    Subdivision 1. Restrictive procedures plan. Schools that intend to use restrictive procedures
shall maintain and make publicly accessible a restrictive procedures plan for children that includes
at least the following:
   (1) the list of restrictive procedures the school intends to use;
   (2) how the school will monitor and review the use of restrictive procedures, including
conducting post-use debriefings and convening an oversight committee; and
   (3) a written description and documentation of the training staff completed under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 2. Restrictive procedures. (a) Restrictive procedures may be used only by a licensed
special education teacher, school social worker, school psychologist, behavior analyst certified by
the National Behavior Analyst Certification Board, a person with a master's degree in behavior
analysis, other licensed education professional, paraprofessional under section 120B.363, or mental
health professional under section 245.4871, subdivision 27, who has completed the training program
under subdivision 5.
   (b) A school shall make reasonable efforts to notify the parent on the same day a restrictive
procedure is used on the child, or if the school is unable to provide same-day notice, notice is sent
within two days by written or electronic means or as otherwise indicated by the child's parent under
paragraph (d).
    (c) When restrictive procedures are used twice in 30 days or when a pattern emerges and
restrictive procedures are not included in a child's individualized education program or behavior
intervention plan, the district must hold a meeting of the individualized education plan team,
conduct or review a functional behavioral analysis, review data, consider developing additional
or revised positive behavioral interventions and supports, consider actions to reduce the use of
restrictive procedures, and modify the individualized education plan or behavior intervention
plan as appropriate. At the meeting, the team must review any known medical or psychological
limitations that contraindicate the use of a restrictive procedure, consider whether to prohibit that
restrictive procedure, and document any prohibition in the individualized education program or
behavior intervention plan.
    (d) An individualized education plan team may plan for using restrictive procedures and may
include these procedures in a child's individualized education program or behavior intervention
plan; however, the restrictive procedures may be used only in response to behavior that constitutes
an emergency, consistent with this section. The individualized education program or behavior
intervention plan shall indicate how the parent wants to be notified when a restrictive procedure
is used.
   Subd. 3. Physical holding or seclusion. Physical holding or seclusion may be used only in an
emergency. A school that uses physical holding or seclusion shall meet the following requirements:

release mechanisms, or locked with locks that have immediate release mechanisms connected with
a fire and emergency system; and
   (vi) not contain objects that a child may use to injure the child or others; and

    Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.15, is amended to read:
    125A.15 PLACEMENT IN ANOTHER DISTRICT; RESPONSIBILITY.
    The responsibility for special instruction and services for a child with a disability temporarily
placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
    (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time
constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
     (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
f­
­a­ i­i
  c­l ­t
       ­y­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may
establish reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the
child placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­) (e).
However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.

in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­

by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

    The council must address methods of implementing the state policy of developing and
implementing comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary interagency programs of early
intervention services for children with disabilities and their families.
   The duties of the council include recommending policies to ensure a comprehensive and
coordinated system of all state and local agency services for children under age five with disabilities
and their families. The policies must address how to incorporate each agency's services into a
unified state and local system of multidisciplinary assessment practices, individual intervention
plans, comprehensive systems to find children in need of services, methods to improve public
awareness, and assistance in determining the role of interagency early intervention committees.
    On the date that Minnesota Part C Annual Performance Report is submitted to the federal
Office of Special Education, the council must recommend to the governor and the commissioners
of education, health, human services, commerce, and employment and economic development
policies for a comprehensive and coordinated system.

    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.51, is amended to read:
  125A.51 PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES; EDUCATION
AND TRANSPORTATION.
    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When a nonresident district makes an emergency placement without first consulting with
the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice of the
emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision, which the
placing district must then provide.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­

reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.

    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract
with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

under this subdivision equals the lesser of:
    (1) 90 percent of the nonpublic school's approved cost for the previous fiscal year according
to subdivision 1 exceeding $10 for fiscal year 2006 and later times the number of weighted pupils
enrolled at the nonpublic school as of October 1 of the previous school year; or
   (2) the product of the district's aid per pupil unit according to subdivision 4 times the number of
weighted pupils enrolled at the nonpublic school as of October 1 of the previous school year.

this subdivision. The nonpublic school is responsible for the Internet access costs not covered by
this section.
    (e) At the request of a nonpublic school, districts may allocate the amount determined in
paragraph (b) directly to the nonpublic school to pay for or offset the nonpublic school's costs
for telecommunications access services; however, the amount allocated directly to the nonpublic
school may not exceed the actual amount of the school's ongoing or recurring telecommunications
access costs.

year increases over that total adjusted net tax capacity for the third year preceding that calendar year.
    (b) The minimum level of support specified under this subdivision or subdivision 4 shall be
certified annually to the participating cities and counties by the Department of Education. If a city
or county chooses to reduce its local support in accordance with subdivision 4, paragraphs (b) or
(c), it shall notify its regional public library system. The regional public library system shall notify
the Department of Education that a revised certification is required. The revised minimum level of
support shall be certified to the city or county by the Department of Education.
    (c) A city which is a part of a regional public library system shall not be required to provide this
level of support if the property of that city is already taxable by the county for the support of that
regional public library system. In no event shall the Department of Education require any city or
county to provide a higher level of support than the level of support specified in this section in order
for a system to qualify for a regional library basic system support grant. This section shall not be
construed to prohibit a city or county from providing a higher level of support for public libraries
than the level of support specified in this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for calendar years 2009 and later, except that the
change in paragraph (a) is effective for calendar years 2011 and later.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 134.34, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Limitation. (a) For calendar year 2010 and later, a regional library basic system
support grant shall not be made to a regional public library system for a participating city or county
which decreases the dollar amount provided for support for operating purposes of public library
service below the amount provided by it for the second, or third preceding year, whichever is less.
For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 1, any funds provided under section 473.757,
subdivision 2, for extending library hours of operation shall not be considered amounts provided
by a city or county for support for operating purposes of public library service. This subdivision
shall not apply to participating cities or counties where the adjusted net tax capacity of that city
or county has decreased, if the dollar amount of the reduction in support is not greater than the
dollar amount by which support would be decreased if the reduction in support were made in direct
proportion to the decrease in adjusted net tax capacity.
    (b) For calendar year 2009 and later, in any calendar year in which a city's or county's aid under
sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 or credits under section 273.1384 is reduced after the city or county
has certified its levy payable in that year, it may reduce its local support by the lesser of:
   (1) ten percent; or
   (2) a percent equal to the ratio of the aid and credit reductions to the city's or county's revenue
base, based on aids certified for the current calendar year. For calendar year 2009 only, the reduction
under this paragraph shall be based on 2008 aid and credit reductions under the December 2008
unallotment, as well as any aid and credit reductions in calendar year 2009. For pay 2009 only, the
commissioner of revenue will calculate the reductions under this paragraph and certify them to the
commissioner of education within 15 days of this provision becoming law.
    (c) For taxes payable in 2010 and later, in any payable year in which the total amounts certified
for city or county aids under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 are less than the total amounts paid
under those sections in the previous calendar year, a city or county may reduce its local support by

the lesser of:
   (1) ten percent; or
   (2) a percent equal to the ratio of:
    (i) the difference between (A) the sum of the aid it was paid under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014
and the credits it received under section 273.1398 in the previous calendar year and (B) the sum of
the aid it is certified to be paid in the current calendar year under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014
and the credits estimated to be paid under section 273.1398; to
    (ii) its revenue base for the previous year, based on aids actually paid in the previous calendar
year. The commissioner of revenue shall calculate the percent aid cut for each county and city under
this paragraph and certify the percentage cuts to the commissioner of education by August 1 of
the year prior to the year in which the reduced aids and credits are to be paid. The percentage
of reduction related to reductions to credits under section 273.1384, shall be based on the best
estimation available as of July 30.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), (b), or (c), no city or county shall reduce its support for public
libraries below the minimum level specified in subdivision 1.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "revenue base" means the sum of:
    (1) its levy for taxes payable in the current calendar year, including the levy on the fiscal
disparities distribution under section 276A.06, subdivision 3, paragraph (a), or 473F.08, subdivision
3, paragraph (a);
   (2) its aid under sections 477A.011 to 477A.014 in the current calendar year; and
   (3) its taconite aid in the current calendar year under sections 298.28 and 298.282.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for support in calendar year 2009 and thereafter
and for library grants paid in fiscal year 2010 and thereafter, except that the changes in paragraph
(a) are effective for support in calendar year 2010 and thereafter.

   119A.52 DISTRIBUTION OF APPROPRIATION.
    (a) The commissioner of education must distribute money appropriated for that purpose to
federally designated Head Start programs to expand services and to serve additional low-income
children. Migrant and Indian reservation programs must be initially allocated money based on the
programs' share of federal funds. The remaining money must be initially allocated to the remaining

local agencies based equally on the agencies' share of federal funds and on the proportion of
eligible children in the agencies' service area who are not currently being served. A Head Start
program must be funded at a per child rate equal to its contracted, federally funded base level at
the start of the fiscal year. For all agencies without a federal Early Head Start rate, the state average
federal cost per child for Early Head Start applies. In allocating funds under this paragraph, the
commissioner of education must assure that each Head Start program in existence in 1993 is
allocated no less funding in any fiscal year than was allocated to that program in fiscal year 1993.
Before paying money to the programs, the commissioner must notify each program of its initial
allocation,­ and how the money must be used,          ­ an

plan under section 119A.535. For any program that cannot utilize its full allocation at the beginning
of the fiscal year, the commissioner must reduce the allocation proportionately. Money available
after the initial allocations are reduced must be redistributed to eligible programs.
    (b) The commissioner must develop procedures to make payments to programs based upon the
number of children reported to be enrolled during the required time period of program operations.
Enrollment is defined by federal Head Start regulations. The procedures must include a reporting
schedule, corrective action plan requirements, and financial consequences to be imposed on
programs that do not meet full enrollment after the period of corrective action. Programs reporting
chronic underenrollment, as defined by the commissioner, will have their subsequent program year
allocation reduced proportionately. Funds made available by prorating payments and allocations to
programs with reported underenrollment will be made available to the extent funds exist to fully
enrolled Head Start programs through a form and manner prescribed by the department.
    (c) Programs with approved innovative initiatives that target services to high-risk populations,
including homeless families and families living in homeless shelters and transitional housing, are
exempt from the procedures in paragraph (b). This exemption does not apply to entire programs.
The exemption applies only to approved innovative initiatives that target services to high-risk
populations, including homeless families and families living in homeless shelters, transitional
housing, and permanent supportive housing.

    (a) There is established a quality rating and improvement system (QRIS) framework to ensure
that Minnesota's children have access to high-quality early learning and care programs in a range
of settings so that they are fully ready for kindergarten by 2020. Creation of a standards-based

    (1) quality opportunities in order to improve the educational outcomes of children so that they
are ready for school. The framework shall be based on the Minnesota quality rating system rating
tool and a common set of child outcome and program standards and informed by evaluation results;
    (2) a tool to increase the number of publicly funded and regulated early learning and care services
in both public and private market programs that are high quality. If a program or provider chooses

    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.522, is amended to read:
    124D.522 ADULT BASIC EDUCATION SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE GRANTS.
    (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the policy review task force under section 124D.521,
53RD DAY]                            WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2009                                            5631

may make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide services that are not offered by a district
adult basic education program or that are supplemental to either the statewide adult basic education
program, or a district's adult basic education program. The commissioner may make grants for:
staff development for adult basic education teachers and administrators; training for volunteer
tutors; training, services, and materials for serving disabled students through adult basic education
programs; statewide promotion of adult basic education services and programs; development and
dissemination of instructional and administrative technology for adult basic education programs;
programs which primarily serve communities of color; adult basic education distance learning
projects, including television instruction programs; and other supplemental services to support the
mission of adult basic education and innovative delivery of adult basic education services.
    (b) The commissioner must establish eligibility criteria and grant application procedures. Grants
under this section must support services throughout the state, focus on educational results for
adult learners, and promote outcome-based achievement through adult basic education programs.
Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the commissioner may make grants under this section from the state
total adult basic education aid set aside for supplemental service grants under section 124D.531. Up
to one-fourth of the appropriation for supplemental service grants must be used for grants for adult
basic education programs to encourage and support innovations in adult basic education instruction
and service delivery. A grant to a single organization cannot exceed ­    $1

total supplemental services aid. Nothing in this section prevents an approved adult basic education
program from using state or federal aid to purchase supplemental services.

    (c) The commissioner of public safety shall develop a comprehensive model school bus driver
training program and model assessments for school bus driver training competencies, which are not
subject to chapter 14. A school district, nonpublic school, or private contractor may use alternative
assessments for bus driver training competencies with the approval of the commissioner of public
safety. A driver may receive at least eight hours of school bus in-service training any year, as an
alternative to being assessed for bus driver competencies after the initial year of being assessed
for bus driver competencies. The employer shall keep the assessment or a record of the in-service
training for the current period available for inspection by representatives of the commissioner.
   (d) A school district, nonpublic school, or private contractor shall provide in-service training
annually to each school bus driver.
