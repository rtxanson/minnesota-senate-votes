    (a) If the sale of securities results in a net gain during a fiscal year, the gain shall be apportioned
in equal installments over the next ten fiscal years to offset net losses in those years. If any portion
of an installment is not needed to recover subsequent losses identified in paragraph (b) it shall be
added to the principal of the fund.
     (b) If the sale of securities results in a net loss during a fiscal year, the net loss shall be recovered
first from the gains in paragraph (a) apportioned to that fiscal year. If these gains are insufficient,

475; or
    (3) notwithstanding section 475.59, as a conjunctive question authorizing both the capital project
levy and the issuance of obligations for the project under chapter 475. Any obligations authorized
for a project may be issued within five years of the date of the election.
    (c) The ballot must provide a general description of the proposed project, state the estimated total
cost of the project, state whether the project has received a positive or negative review and comment
from the commissioner, state the maximum amount of the capital project levy as a percentage of
net tax capacity, state the amount that will be raised by that local tax rate in the first year it is to be
levied, and state the maximum number of years that the levy authorization will apply.
   The ballot must contain a textual portion with the information required in this section and a
question stating substantially the following:
   "Shall the capital project levy proposed by the board of .......... School District No. .......... be
approved?"
    If approved, the amount provided by the approved local tax rate applied to the net tax capacity
for the year preceding the year the levy is certified may be certified for the number of years, not to
exceed ten, approved.
    (d) If the authority for an existing project is expiring and the district is proposing a new project
at the same maximum tax rate, the general description on the ballot may state that the capital project
levy is being renewed and that the tax rate is not being increased from the previous year's rate
and the notice required under section 276.60, may be modified to read: "BY VOTING YES ON

THIS BALLOT QUESTION, YOU ARE VOTING TO EXTEND THE AUTHORITY FOR AN
EXPIRING CAPITAL PROJECT AT THE SAME TAX RATE."
    (e) In the event a conjunctive question proposes to authorize both the capital project levy and the
issuance of obligations for the project, appropriate language authorizing the issuance of obligations
must also be included in the question.
    (f) The district must notify the commissioner of the results of the referendum.

insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who have
terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or other

science apply to all public school students, except the very few students with extreme cognitive
or physical impairments for whom an individualized education plan team has determined that the
required academic standards are inappropriate. An individualized education plan team that makes
this determination must establish alternative standards.
    A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation requirements
that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A school district that
incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school year must provide
students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the opportunity to earn a
diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in effect when the students
entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve instruction or curriculum
as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and
120B.20.
   The commissioner must include the contributions of Minnesota American Indian tribes and
communities as they relate to the academic standards during the review and revision of the required
academic standards.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all school districts and charter schools beginning in the 2012-2013 school year and later. A school
district or charter school is strongly encouraged to implement state physical education standards in
an earlier school year than the 2012-2013 school year if it has adopted physical education standards
equivalent to the standards developed by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education
under section 31 on the effective date of this act, or if it is scheduled to undertake the periodic review
of its local physical education standards under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.023, subdivision
2, paragraph (g), in a school year before the 2012-2013 school year, it is strongly encouraged to
implement state physical education standards consistent with section 31 in an earlier school year.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.023, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Revisions and reviews required. (a) The commissioner of education must

   120B.15 GIFTED AND TALENTED STUDENTS PROGRAMS.
   (a) School districts and charter schools may identify students, locally develop programs
addressing instructional and affective needs, provide staff development, and evaluate programs to
provide gifted and talented students with challenging and appropriate educational programs.
    (b) School districts and charter schools may adopt guidelines for assessing and identifying
students for participation in gifted and talented programs. The guidelines should include the use of:
   (1) multiple and objective criteria; and
    (2) assessments and procedures that are valid and reliable, fair, and based on current theory
and research addressing the use of tools and methods that are sensitive to underrepresented groups,
including, but not limited to, students who are low income, minority, gifted and learning disabled,
and English language learners.
    (c) School districts and charter schools must adopt procedures for the academic acceleration of
gifted and talented students. These procedures must include how the district will:
   (1) assess a student's readiness and motivation for acceleration; and
    (2) match the level, complexity, and pace of the curriculum to a student to achieve the best type
of academic acceleration for that student.
   Sec. 6. [120B.21] MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION.
    The legislature encourages districts to provide instruction in mental health for students in grades
7 through 12. Instruction must be aligned with local health standards and integrated into a district's
existing programs, curriculum, or the general school environment. The commissioner of education,
in consultation with mental health organizations, shall provide assistance to districts including:
   (1) age-appropriate model learning activities for grades 7 through 12 that address mental health
components of the National Health Education Standards and the benchmarks developed by the
department's quality teaching network in health and best practices in mental health education; and
    (2) a directory of resources for planning and implementing age-appropriate mental health
curriculum and instruction in grades 7 through 12.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 1, is amended to

    In addition, the school board granting the students their diplomas may formally decide to
include a notation of high achievement on the high school diplomas of those graduating seniors
who, according to established school board criteria, demonstrate exemplary academic achievement
during high school.
    (e) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school test results shall be available to districts for
diagnostic purposes affecting student learning and district instruction and curriculum, and for
establishing educational accountability. The commissioner must disseminate to the public the high
school test results upon receiving those results.
    (f) The 3rd through 8th grade and high school tests must be aligned with state academic
standards. The commissioner shall determine the testing process and the order of administration.
107TH DAY]                          SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                      12283

The statewide results shall be aggregated at the site and district level, consistent with subdivision
1a.
   (g) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternate assessments;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
   (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.30, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. High school algebra end-of-course assessment. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision
1, the commissioner shall establish a statewide high school algebra end-of-course assessment for
students entering grade 8 in the 2010-2011 school year and later that provides information on the
college and career readiness of Minnesota students and fulfills federal accountability requirements,
consistent with this subdivision and related rules. For purposes of this subdivision, "college
and career readiness" means the knowledge and skills that a high school graduate needs to do
either credit-bearing coursework at a two-year or four-year college or university or career-track
employment that pays a living wage, provides employment benefits, and offers clear pathways for
advancement through further education and training.
    (b) This statewide high school algebra end-of-course assessment must conform with the
following:
   (1) align with the most recently revised academic content standards under section 120B.023,
subdivision 2;
   (2) include both multiple-choice and open-ended items that assess the appropriate algebra
knowledge and skills contained in the state's academic content standards;
    (3) be designed for computer administration and scoring so that, beginning the second year a
computerized test is administered and as soon as practicable during the first year a computerized
test is administered, the exam results of students who take computerized tests are available to the
school or district within three full school days after the exam is administered, among other design
characteristics;
   (4) be administered at regular intervals that align with the most common high school schedules
in Minnesota;
   (5) generate achievement levels established through a professionally recognized methodology;
12284                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [107TH DAY

   (6) use achievement level descriptors that define a student's college and career readiness;
   (7) comprise 20 percent of the student's overall course grade in the corresponding course;
    (8) require a student who does not pass a high school algebra course to (i) retake the course or
complete a district-authorized credit recovery class, (ii) opt, at the student's election, to retake the
end-of-course assessment within a regularly scheduled administration window, and (iii) have the
student select the exam score on the initial test or the retest to count as the equivalent of 20 percent
of the student's overall course grade;
   (9) allow an eligible student to meet this requirement through an alternative method that
demonstrates the student's college and career readiness:
   (i) for high school students who transfer into Minnesota from another state where the algebra
course content, as applicable, is of equal or greater rigor, pass that state's high school course and
graduation requirements in algebra, as applicable;
    (ii) allow a student who has an active individualized education program to achieve a passing
status at an individual level as prescribed by the commissioner;
    (iii) waive the required exam for a high school student who is an English language learner under
section 124D.59 and who has been enrolled for four or fewer years in a school in which English is
the primary language of instruction; or
   (iv) other alternative methods recommended by the Assessment Advisory Committee, if
subsequently specifically authorized by law to allow other alternative methods;
    (10) use three consecutive school years of research and analysis through the 2014-2015 school
year, as prescribed by the commissioner, to calculate and report an alignment index that compares
students' final grades in this course with their end-of-course assessment scores;
    (11) subsequent to calculating and reporting the alignment index under clause (10), require
schools that are highly misaligned for two or more consecutive school years to transmit written
notice of the misalignment to all parents of students enrolled in the school, as prescribed by the
commissioner; and
   (12) when schools are highly misaligned for two or more consecutive years under clause (11),
use school district funds under section 122A.60, subdivision 1a, paragraph (a), to correct the
misalignment.
    (c) The requirements of this subdivision apply to students in public schools, including charter
schools, who enter grade 8 in the 2010-2011 school year or later. The commissioner may establish
a transition period where students who enter grade 8 in the 2010-2011 or 2011-2012 school year
graduate either under the Graduation-Required Assessment for Diploma requirements under
section 120B.30, subdivision 1, or this subdivision. The commissioner may seek authority from the
legislature to adjust the time line under this paragraph if circumstances such as changes in federal
law governing educational accountability and assessment warrant such an adjustment.
   (d) To fully implement this subdivision and enable school districts to provide intervention
and support to struggling students and improve instruction for all students, the commissioner
must provide districts with (1) a benchmark assessment aligned with the high school algebra
107TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                          12285

end-of-course assessment, and as funding allows, may provide districts with (2) an item bank
available to teachers for creating formative assessments to help students prepare for the high school
algebra end-of-course assessment.
    (e) The commissioner shall expand the membership and purpose of the Assessment Advisory
Committee established under section 120B.365 to include assessment experts and practitioners from
both secondary and postsecondary education systems and other appropriate stakeholders to monitor
the implementation of and student outcomes based on the algebra end-of-course assessment and
policies and the state support available to districts, including small or rural districts, under this
subdivision. This committee shall report annually by February 15 to the commissioner and the
legislature on the implementation of and student outcomes based on the assessment and policies
under this subdivision. Notwithstanding section 15.059, subdivision 3, committee members shall
not receive compensation, per diem payments, or reimbursement for expenses.
    (f) Using a solicitation process that includes a "request for proposal" process and multiple
responses, the commissioner shall contract for at least two independent studies at two-year intervals
to evaluate (1) the implementation of the requirements and (2) the availability and efficacy of
resources to support and improve student outcomes based on student achievement data under this
subdivision. The commissioner must submit the results of the first study to the education policy
and finance committees of the legislature by February 15, 2015. The commissioner must submit
the results of the second study to the legislature by February 15, 2017.
   (g) The commissioner must not begin to develop additional statewide end-of-course exams in
geometry, chemistry, or physics until specifically authorized in law to do so.
    (h) A district or charter school must indicate on a student's transcript the student's level of college
and career readiness in algebra under this subdivision after the levels have been established through
a professionally recognized methodology.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 3, is amended to

including the performance achievement levels developed from students' unweighted test scores
in each tested subject and a listing of demographic factors that strongly correlate with student
performance. The test results must not include personally identifiable information as defined in
Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 99.3. The commissioner shall also report data that
compares performance results among school sites, school districts, Minnesota and other states, and
Minnesota and other nations. The commissioner shall disseminate to schools and school districts
a more comprehensive report containing testing information that meets local needs for evaluating
instruction and curriculum.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.30, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 4. Access to tests. Consistent with section 13.34, the commissioner must adopt and
publish a policy to provide public and parental access for review of basic skills tests, Minnesota
Comprehensive Assessments, or any other such statewide test and assessment which would not
12286                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                              [107TH DAY

compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. Upon receiving a
written request, the commissioner must make available to parents or guardians a copy of their
student's actual responses to the test questions for their review.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 120B.35, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. State growth target; other state measures. (a) The state's educational assessment
system measuring individual students' educational growth is based on indicators of achievement
growth that show an individual student's prior achievement. Indicators of achievement and prior
achievement must be based on highly reliable statewide or districtwide assessments.
   (b) The commissioner, in consultation with a stakeholder group that includes assessment and
evaluation directors and staff and researchers must implement a model that uses a value-added
growth indicator and includes criteria for identifying schools and school districts that demonstrate
medium and high growth under section 120B.299, subdivisions 8 and 9, and may recommend other
value-added measures under section 120B.299, subdivision 3. The model may be used to advance
educators' professional development and replicate programs that succeed in meeting students'
diverse learning needs. Data on individual teachers generated under the model are personnel data
under section 13.43. The model must allow users to:
   (1) report student growth consistent with this paragraph; and
    (2) for all student categories, report and compare aggregated and disaggregated state growth
data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act
and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively, following appropriate reporting
practices to protect nonpublic student data.
   The commissioner must report separate measures of student growth and proficiency, consistent
with this paragraph.
    (c) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2011, must report two core measures indicating the
extent to which current high school graduates are being prepared for postsecondary academic and
career opportunities:
    (1) a preparation measure indicating the number and percentage of high school graduates
in the most recent school year who completed course work important to preparing them for
postsecondary academic and career opportunities, consistent with the core academic subjects
required for admission to Minnesota's public colleges and universities as determined by the Office
of Higher Education under chapter 136A; and
   (2) a rigorous coursework measure indicating the number and percentage of high school
graduates in the most recent school year who successfully completed one or more college-level
advanced placement, international baccalaureate, postsecondary enrollment options including
concurrent enrollment, other rigorous courses of study under section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, or
industry certification courses or programs.
When reporting the core measures under clauses (1) and (2), the commissioner must also analyze
and report separate categories of information using the nine student categories identified under the
federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female,
107TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                        12287

respectively, following appropriate reporting practices to protect nonpublic student data.
    (d) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2014, must report summary data on school safety
and students' engagement and connection at school. The summary data under this paragraph
are separate from and must not be used for any purpose related to measuring or evaluating the
performance of classroom teachers. The commissioner, in consultation with qualified experts on
student engagement and connection and classroom teachers, must identify highly reliable variables
that generate summary data under this paragraph. The summary data may be used at school,
district, and state levels only. Any data on individuals received, collected, or created that are
used to generate the summary data under this paragraph are nonpublic data under section 13.02,
subdivision 9.
    (e) For purposes of statewide educational accountability, the commissioner must identify and
report measures that demonstrate the success of school districts, school sites, charter schools,
and alternative program providers in improving the graduation outcomes of students under
this paragraph. When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner, beginning July 1, 2013, must annually report summary data on (i) the four- and
six-year graduation rates of students throughout the state who are identified as at risk of not
graduating or off track to graduate, including students who are eligible to participate in a program
under section 123A.05 or 124D.68, among other students, and (ii) the success that school districts,
school sites, charter schools, and alternative program providers experience in:
   (1) identifying at-risk and off-track student populations by grade;
   (2) providing successful prevention and intervention strategies for at-risk students;
    (3) providing successful recuperative and recovery or reenrollment strategies for off-track
students; and
   (4) improving the graduation outcomes of at-risk and off-track students.
    For purposes of this paragraph, a student who is at risk of not graduating is a student in eighth or
ninth grade who meets one or more of the following criteria: first enrolled in an English language
learners program in eighth or ninth grade and may be older than other students enrolled in the same
grade; as an eighth grader, is absent from school for at least 20 percent of the days of instruction
during the school year, is two or more years older than other students enrolled in the same grade, or
fails multiple core academic courses; or as a ninth grader, fails multiple ninth grade core academic
courses in English language arts, math, science, or social studies.
   For purposes of this paragraph, a student who is off track to graduate is a student who meets
one or more of the following criteria: first enrolled in an English language learners program in high
school and is older than other students enrolled in the same grade; is a returning dropout; is 16 or
17 years old and two or more academic years off track to graduate; is 18 years or older and two
or more academic years off track to graduate; or is 18 years or older and may graduate within one
school year.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. Paragraph (e) applies to data that are collected in the 2012-2013 school
year and later and reported annually beginning July 1, 2013, consistent with the recommendations
the commissioner receives from recognized and qualified experts on improving differentiated

    Subdivision 1. School performance report cards. (a) The commissioner shall report student
academic performance under section 120B.35, subdivision 2; the percentages of students showing
low, medium, and high growth under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); school safety
and student engagement and connection under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (d);
rigorous coursework under section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (c); the four- and six-year
graduation rates of at-risk and off-track students throughout the state under section 120B.35,
subdivision 3, paragraph (e), and the success that school districts, school sites, charter schools,
and alternative program providers experience in their efforts to improve the graduation outcomes
of those students; two separate student-to-teacher ratios that clearly indicate the definition of
teacher consistent with sections 122A.06 and 122A.15 for purposes of determining these ratios;
staff characteristics excluding salaries; student enrollment demographics; district mobility; and
extracurricular activities. The report also must indicate a school's adequate yearly progress status,
and must not set any designations applicable to high- and low-performing schools due solely to
adequate yearly progress status.
   (b) The commissioner shall develop, annually update, and post on the department Web site
school performance report cards.
   (c) The commissioner must make available performance report cards by the beginning of each
school year.
   (d) A school or district may appeal its adequate yearly progress status in writing to the
commissioner within 30 days of receiving the notice of its status. The commissioner's decision to
uphold or deny an appeal is final.
    (e) School performance report card data are nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9,
until not later than ten days after the appeal procedure described in paragraph (d) concludes. The
department shall annually post school performance report cards to its public Web site no later than
September 1.

    Districts must assign a school administrator to serve as a HOUSSE reviewer to meet with
teachers under this paragraph and, where appropriate, certify the teachers' applications. Teachers
satisfy the definition of highly qualified when the teachers receive at least 100 of the total number
of points used to measure the teachers' content expertise under clauses (1) to (7). Teachers may
acquire up to 50 points only in any one clause (1) to (7). Teachers may use the HOUSSE process
to satisfy the definition of highly qualified for more than one subject area.
   (c) Achievement of the HOUSSE criteria is not equivalent to a license. A teacher must obtain
permission from the Board of Teaching in order to teach in a public school.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.18, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

reading, writing, and mathematics before being granted an initial teaching license to provide direct
instruction to pupils in prekindergarten, elementary, secondary, or special education programs. The
board must require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program
to provide remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in
their institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those
for whom English is a second language. The colleges and universities must provide assistance in the
specific academic areas of deficiency in which the person did not achieve a qualifying score. School
districts must provide similar, appropriate, and timely remedial assistance that includes a formal
diagnostic component and mentoring to those persons employed by the district who completed
their teacher education program outside the state of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach
in Minnesota and did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those
persons for whom English is a second language. The Board of Teaching shall report annually to
the education committees of the legislature on the total number of teacher candidates during the
most recent school year taking the skills examination, the number who achieve a qualifying score
on the examination, the number who do not achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the
distribution of all candidates' scores, the number of candidates who have taken the examination at
least once before, and the number of candidates who have taken the examination at least once before
and achieve a qualifying score.

teacher licensure must include in their teacher preparation programs a common core of teaching
knowledge and skills to be acquired by all persons recommended for teacher licensure. This
common core shall meet the standards developed by the interstate new teacher assessment and
support consortium in its 1992 "model standards for beginning teacher licensing and development."
Amendments to standards adopted under this paragraph are covered by chapter 14. The board of
teaching shall report annually to the education committees of the legislature on the performance
of teacher candidates on common core assessments of knowledge and skills under this paragraph
during the most recent school year.
     (e) The Board of Teaching must:
    (1) ensure that kindergarten through grade 12 teacher licensing standards are highly aligned with
the state's kindergarten through grade 12 academic standards;
    (2) adopt a review cycle that is consistent with the kindergarten through grade 12 academic
standards review cycle under section 120B.023, subdivision 2; and
   (3) review and align the teacher licensure standards with the kindergarten through grade 12
academic standards within one school year after the commissioner reviews and adopts revised
kindergarten through grade 12 academic standards in a particular subject area.
   (f) All teacher preparation programs approved by the Board of Teaching must require teacher
candidates to complete at least one online course.
     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 122A.23, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Applicants licensed in other states. (a) Subject to the requirements of sections
122A.18, subdivision 8, and 123B.03, the Board of Teaching must issue a teaching license or
a temporary teaching license under paragraphs (b) to (e) to an applicant who holds at least a
baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university and holds or held a
similar out-of-state teaching license that requires the applicant to successfully complete a teacher
preparation program approved by the issuing state, which includes field-specific teaching methods
and student teaching or essentially equivalent experience.

between the nonpublic school and a public school or neutral site for nonpublic school pupils who
are provided pupil support services under this section if the district elects to provide pupil support
services at a site other than the nonpublic school. Each request for pupil support services must
set forth the guidance and counseling or health services requested by or on behalf of all eligible

area must not expend an amount for these pupil support services which exceeds the amount allotted
to it under this section.

   (e) The authorizer must participate in department-approved training.
    (f) An authorizer that chartered a school before August 1, 2009, must apply by June 30, 2011, to
the commissioner for approval, under paragraph (c), to continue as an authorizer under this section.
For purposes of this paragraph, an authorizer that fails to submit a timely application is ineligible
to charter a school.
    (g) The commissioner shall review an authorizer's performance every five years in a manner
and form determined by the commissioner and may review an authorizer's performance more
frequently at the commissioner's own initiative or at the request of a charter school operator,
charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action.
    (h) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; or
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) An authorizer, after receiving an application from a school
developer, may charter a licensed teacher under section 122A.18, subdivision 1, or a group of
individuals that includes one or more licensed teachers under section 122A.18, subdivision 1,
to operate a school subject to the commissioner's approval of the authorizer's affidavit under
paragraph (b). The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A
or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
107TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                       12297

of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.
    (c) The authorizer may prevent an approved charter school from opening for operation if, among
other grounds, the charter school violates this section or does not meet the ready-to-open standards
that are part of the authorizer's oversight and evaluation process or are stipulated in the charter
school contract.
    (d) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as
a cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must
establish a board of directors composed of at least five members who are not related parties until
a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according
to the school's articles and bylaws under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must
be composed of at least five members who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the
school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents
or legal guardians of children enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members
of the school's board of directors. A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board
election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with
chapter 13D.
    (e) Upon the request of an individual, the charter school must make available in a timely fashion
the minutes of meetings of the board of directors, and of members and committees having any
board-delegated authority; financial statements showing all operations and transactions affecting
income, surplus, and deficit during the school's last annual accounting period; and a balance sheet
summarizing assets and liabilities on the closing date of the accounting period. A charter school also
must post on its official Web site information identifying its authorizer and indicate how to contact
that authorizer and include that same information about its authorizer in other school materials that
it makes available to the public.
    (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one
licensed teacher employed and serving as a teacher at the school or a licensed teacher providing
instruction under a ­co

or legal guardian of a student enrolled in the charter school who is not employed by the charter
school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed by the charter school and
does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher majority board composed
of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the chief administrator ­a­

the board. Charter school employees shall not serve on the board unless item (i) applies. Contractors
providing facilities, goods, or services to a charter school shall not serve on the board of directors of
the charter school. Board bylaws shall outline the process and procedures for changing the board's
governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may change its governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and
   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must show that:
   (1) the expansion proposed by the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
    (2) the charter school expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating
students' improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter
120B;
   (3) the charter school is fiscally sound and has the financial capacity to implement the proposed
expansion; and
   (4) the authorizer finds that the charter school has the management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the authorizer of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the authorizer then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school may not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.

read:
   Subd. 6a. Audit report. (a) The charter school must submit an audit report to the commissioner
and its authorizer by December 31 each year.
    (b) The charter school, with the assistance of the auditor conducting the audit, must include with
the report a copy of all charter school agreements for corporate management services. If the entity
that provides the professional services to the charter school is exempt from taxation under section
501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that entity must file with the commissioner by February
15 a copy of the annual return required under section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (c) If the commissioner receives an audit report indicating that a material weakness exists in the
financial reporting systems of a charter school, the charter school must submit a written report to
the commissioner explaining how the material weakness will be resolved. An entity, as a condition
of providing financial services to a charter school, must agree to make available information about
a charter school's financial audit to the commissioner upon request.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 23, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with an authorizer must be for the term contained in the contract according to
subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating
a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed
action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and
that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the
authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract.
Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 15-business-day
period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written
request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to the charter school's board
of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal hearing before taking
final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract no later than 20
business days before the proposed date for terminating the contract or the end date of the contract.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
   (3) violations of law; or
   (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 308A or 317A.
   (c) If the sponsor and the charter school board of directors mutually agree to terminate or not
renew the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves the transfer
12300                                       JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                [107TH DAY

to a different eligible authorizer to authorize the charter school. Both parties must jointly submit
their intent in writing to the commissioner to mutually terminate the contract. The sponsor that is
a party to the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about
the fiscal and operational status and student performance of the school. Before the commissioner
determines whether to approve a transfer of authorizer, the commissioner first must determine
whether the charter school and prospective new authorizer can identify and effectively resolve
those circumstances causing the previous authorizer and the charter school to mutually agree to
terminate the contract. If no transfer of sponsor is approved, the school must be dissolved according
to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
     (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing under
chapter 14, may terminate the existing contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
if the charter school has a history of:

   Sec. 29. IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENTIATED GRADUATION RATE MEASURES
AND EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO A STANDARD DIPLOMA FOR
AT-RISK AND OFF-TRACK STUDENTS.
     (a) To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (e), the commissioner of education must convene a group of recognized and qualified
experts on improving differentiated graduation rates and establishing alternative routes to a standard
high school diploma for at-risk and off-track students throughout the state. The commissioner must
assist the group, as requested, to explore and recommend to the commissioner and the legislature
(i) research-based measures that demonstrate the relative success of school districts, school sites,
charter schools, and alternative program providers in improving the graduation outcomes of
at-risk and off-track students, and (ii) state options for establishing alternative routes to a standard
diploma consistent with the educational accountability system under Minnesota Statutes, chapter
120B. When proposing alternative routes to a standard diploma, the group also must identify
highly reliable variables that generate summary data to comply with Minnesota Statutes, section
120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), including: who initiates the request for an alternative route;
who approves the request for an alternative route; the parameters of the alternative route process,
including whether a student first must fail a regular, state-mandated exam; and the comparability of
the academic and achievement criteria reflected in the alternative route and the standard route for a
standard diploma. The group is also encouraged to identify the data, time lines, and methods needed
to evaluate and report on the alternative routes to a standard diploma once they are implemented
and the student outcomes that result from those routes.

selected by the Minnesota Association of School Administrators; one currently serving high school
principal selected by the Minnesota Association of Secondary School Principals; and two public
members selected by the commissioner. The group may seek input from representatives of other
interested stakeholders and organizations with expertise to help inform the group's work. The
group must meet at least quarterly. Group members do not receive compensation or reimbursement
of expenses for participating in this group. The group expires February 16, 2012.
     (c) The group, by February 15, 2012, must develop and submit to the commissioner and the
education policy and finance committees of the legislature recommendations and legislation,
consistent with this section and Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (e),
for:
    (1) measuring and reporting differentiated graduation rates for at-risk and off-track students
throughout the state and the success and costs that school districts, school sites, charter schools,
and alternative program providers experience in identifying and serving at-risk or off-track student
populations; and
   (2) establishing alternative routes to a standard diploma.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2013.
   Sec. 30. RULEMAKING AUTHORITY.
    The commissioner of education shall adopt rules consistent with chapter 14 that provide English
language proficiency standards for instruction of students identified as limited English proficient
under Minnesota Statutes, sections 124D.58 to 124D.64. The English language proficiency
standards must encompass the language domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The
English language proficiency standards must reflect social and academic dimensions of acquiring
a second language that are accepted of English language learners in prekindergarten through
grade 12. The English language proficiency standards must address the specific contexts for
language acquisition in the areas of social and instructional settings as well as academic language
encountered in language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. The English language
proficiency standards must express the progression of language development through language
proficiency levels. The English language proficiency standards must be implemented for all limited
English proficient students beginning in the 2011-2012 school year and assessed beginning in the

2012-2013 school year.
   Sec. 31. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
    Subdivision 1. Recess guidelines. The department is encouraged to develop voluntary school
district guidelines that promote high quality recess practices and foster student behaviors that lead
students to increase their activity levels, improve their social skills, and misbehave less.
   Subd. 2. Common course catalogue. The department is encouraged to include in the Minnesota
common course catalogue all district physical education classes and physical education graduation
requirements.
   Subd. 3. Standards adoption. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, sections 120B.021,
subdivision 2, and 120B.023, any statutory criteria required when reviewing or revising standards
and benchmarks, any requirements governing the content of statewide standards, and any other
law to the contrary, the commissioner of education shall initially adopt the most recent standards
developed by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education for physical education in
kindergarten through grade 12.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 32. HEALTHY KIDS AWARDS PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Recognition. The healthy kids awards program rewards kindergarten through
grade 12 students for their nutritional well-being and physical activity. In addition to the physical
and nutritional education students receive in physical education classes, the program is intended
to integrate physical activity and nutritional education into nonphysical education classes, recess,
and extracurricular activities throughout the day. Interested schools must agree to participate from
October through May of each school year.
    Subd. 2. School district participation. School districts annually by September 15 may submit to
the commissioner of education a letter of intent to participate in a healthy kids awards program from
October to May during the current school year. The commissioner must recognize on the school
performance report card under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.36, those schools and districts that
affirm to the commissioner, as prescribed by the commissioner, that at least 75 percent of students in
the school or district are physically active for at least 60 minutes each school day. The time students
spend participating in a physical education class counts toward the daily 60-minute requirement.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies
beginning in the 2010-2011 school year and later.
   Sec. 33. ASSESSMENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE; RECOMMENDATIONS.
    (a) The Assessment Advisory Committee must develop recommendations for alternative
methods by which students satisfy the high school algebra end-of-course requirements under
Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1b, paragraph (b), clause (9), and demonstrate
their college and career readiness. The Assessment Advisory Committee, among other alternative
methods and if consistent with federal educational accountability law, must consider allowing
students to:
   (1) achieve the mathematics college readiness score on the American College Test (ACT) or
12306                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [107TH DAY

Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) exam;
   (2) achieve a college-credit score on a College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) for algebra;
    (3) achieve a score on an equivalent Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate exam
that would earn credit at a four-year college or university; or
    (4) pass a credit-bearing course in college algebra or a more advanced course in that subject with
a grade of C or better under Minnesota Statutes, section 124D.09, including Minnesota Statutes,
section 124D.09, subdivision 10.
    (b) The Assessment Advisory Committee, in the context of the high school algebra
end-of-course assessment under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1b, may develop
recommendations on integrating universal design principles to improve access to learning and
assessments for all students, more accurately understand what students know and can do, provide
Minnesota with more cost-effective assessments, and provide educators with more valid inferences
about students' achievement levels.
    (c) The Assessment Advisory Committee, for purposes of fully implementing the high school
algebra end-of-course assessment under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1b, also
must develop recommendations for:
    (1) calculating the alignment index, including how questions about validity and reliability are
resolved; and
    (2) defining "misaligned" and "highly misaligned" and when and under what specific
circumstances misalignments occur.
    (d) By February 15, 2011, the Assessment Advisory Committee must submit its
recommendations under this section to the education commissioner and the education policy and
finance committees of the legislature.
    (e) The commissioner must not implement any element of any recommendation under
paragraphs (a) to (d) related to the high school algebra end-of-course assessment under Minnesota
Statutes, section 120B.30, subdivision 1b, without first receiving specific legislative authority to
do so.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 34. PERSISTENTLY LOWEST-ACHIEVING                             SCHOOL       DESIGNATION;
FEDERAL SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT GRANTS.
     Upon request of a traditional public or charter school, the commissioner shall seek an exception
from the United States Department of Education, to the extent it is permitted under the school
improvement grant requirements, from the designation as a persistently lowest-achieving school
if the school has shown student growth in proficiency from 2007 through 2010 of over 50 percent
in the high-growth category under the Minnesota growth model under Minnesota Statutes, section
120B.299. A traditional public or charter school may only request this exemption if it is identified
as a persistently lowest-achieving school under the graduation rate definition or if the school has an
approved program under Minnesota Statutes, section 124D.68.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

     Sec. 3. [125A.031] RESOLVING DISPUTES AMONG DISTRICTS.
    If districts dispute which district is responsible for providing or making available special
education and related services to a child with a disability who is not currently enrolled in a district
because the child's district of residence is disputed, the district in which that child first tries to
enroll shall provide or make available special education and related services to the child until
the commissioner is notified and expeditiously resolves the dispute. For purposes of this section,
"district" means a school district or a charter school.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 125A.091, subdivision 7, is amended to

    Subd. 7. Conciliation conference. A parent must have an opportunity to meet with appropriate
district staff in at least one conciliation conference if the parent objects to any proposal of which
the parent receives notice under subdivision 3a. A district must offer to hold a conciliation
conference within two business days after receiving a parent's objection to a proposal or refusal
in the prior written notice. The district must hold the conciliation conference within ten calendar

conference are confidential and are not admissible in a due process hearing. Within five school
days after the final conciliation conference, the district must prepare and provide to the parent a
conciliation conference memorandum that describes the district's final proposed offer of service.
This memorandum is admissible in evidence in any subsequent proceeding.

all conciliation conferences required after that date.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 125A.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Third party reimbursement. (a) Beginning July 1, 2000, districts shall seek
reimbursement from insurers and similar third parties for the cost of services provided by the
district whenever the services provided by the district are otherwise covered by the child's health
coverage. Districts shall request, but may not require, the child's family to provide information
about the child's health coverage when a child with a disability begins to receive services from
the district of a type that may be reimbursable, and shall request, but may not require, updated
information after that as needed.
    (b) For children enrolled in medical assistance under chapter 256B or MinnesotaCare under
chapter 256L who have no other health coverage, a district shall provide an initial written notice to
the enrolled child's parent or legal representative of its intent to seek reimbursement from medical

assistance or MinnesotaCare for the individual education plan health-related services provided by
the district. The notice shall include:
    (1) the right of the parent or legal representative to request a copy of all records concerning
individualized education program health-related services disclosed by the district to any third party;
    (2) the right of the parent or legal representative to withdraw consent for disclosing a child's
records at any time without consequence, including consent that was initially given as part of the
application process for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section 256B.08, subdivision 1;
and
    (3) a decision to revoke consent for schools to share information from education records does
not impact a parent's eligibility for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance.
   (c) The district shall give the parent or legal representative annual written notice of:
    (1) the district's intent to seek reimbursement from medical assistance or MinnesotaCare for
individual education plan health-related services provided by the district;
    (2) the right of the parent or legal representative to request a copy of all records concerning
individual education plan health-related services disclosed by the district to any third party; and
   (3) the right of the parent or legal representative to withdraw consent for disclosure of a child's
records at any time without consequence, including consent that was initially given as part of the
application process for MinnesotaCare or medical assistance under section 256B.08, subdivision 1.
The written notice shall be provided as part of the written notice required by Code of Federal
Regulations, title 34, section 300.504.
    (d) In order to access the private health care coverage of a child who is covered by private health
care coverage in whole or in part, a district must:
   (1) obtain annual written informed consent from the parent or legal representative, in compliance
with subdivision 5; and
    (2) inform the parent or legal representative that a refusal to permit the district or state Medicaid
agency to access their private health care coverage does not relieve the district of its responsibility
to provide all services necessary to provide free and appropriate public education at no cost to the
parent or legal representative.
    (e) If the commissioner of human services obtains federal approval to exempt covered
individual education plan health-related services from the requirement that private health care
coverage refuse payment before medical assistance may be billed, paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) shall
also apply to students with a combination of private health care coverage and health care coverage
through medical assistance or MinnesotaCare.
   (f) In the event that Congress or any federal agency or the Minnesota legislature or any state
agency establishes lifetime limits, limits for any health care services, cost-sharing provisions, or
otherwise provides that individual education plan health-related services impact benefits for persons
enrolled in medical assistance or MinnesotaCare, the amendments to this subdivision adopted in
2002 are repealed on the effective date of any federal or state law or regulation that imposes the
limits. In that event, districts must obtain informed consent consistent with this subdivision as it

State Academies is described in this section.
    (a) A pupil who is deaf, hard of hearing, or blind-deaf, may be admitted to the Academy for the
Deaf. A pupil who is blind or visually impaired, blind-deaf, or multiply disabled may be admitted to
the Academy for the Blind. For a pupil to be admitted, two decisions must be made under sections
125A.03 to 125A.24 and 125A.65.
    (1) It must be decided by the individual education planning team that education in regular or
special education classes in the pupil's district of residence cannot be achieved satisfactorily because
of the nature and severity of the deafness or blindness or visual impairment respectively.
  (2) It must be decided by the individual education planning team that the academy provides the
most appropriate placement within the least restrictive alternative for the pupil.
   (b) A deaf or hard of hearing child or a visually impaired pupil may be admitted to get
socialization skills or on a short-term basis for skills development.
    (c) A parent of a child who resides in Minnesota and who meets the disability criteria for being
deaf or hard-of-hearing, blind or visually impaired, or multiply disabled may apply to place the
child in the Minnesota State Academies. Academy staff must review the application to determine

whether the Minnesota State Academies is an appropriate placement for the child. If academy staff
determine that the Minnesota State Academies is an appropriate placement, the staff must invite
the individualized education program team at the child's resident school district to participate in a
meeting to arrange a trial placement of between 60 and 90 calendar days at the Minnesota State
Academies. If the child's parent consents to the trial placement, the Minnesota State Academies is
the responsible serving school district and incur all due process obligations under law and the child's
resident school district is responsible for any transportation included in the child's individualized
education program during the trial placement. Before the trial placement ends, academy staff must
convene an individualized education program team meeting to determine whether to continue the
child's placement at the Minnesota State Academies or that another placement is appropriate. If the
individualized education program team and the parent are unable to agree on the child's placement,
the child's placement reverts to the placement in the child's individualized education program that
immediately preceded the trial placement. If the parent and individualized education program
team agree to continue the placement beyond the trial period, the transportation and due process
responsibilities are the same as those described for the trial placement under this paragraph.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2010-2011 school year and later.
   Sec. 13. Laws 2009, chapter 79, article 5, section 60, is amended to read:
        Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256L.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 1c. Open enrollment and streamlined application and enrollment process. (a) The
commissioner and local agencies working in partnership must develop a streamlined and efficient
application and enrollment process for medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees that meets
the criteria specified in this subdivision.
    (b) The commissioners of human services and education shall provide recommendations to the
legislature by January 15, 2010, on the creation of an open enrollment process for medical assistance
and MinnesotaCare that is coordinated with the public education system. The recommendations
must:
    (1) be developed in consultation with medical assistance and MinnesotaCare enrollees and
representatives from organizations that advocate on behalf of children and families, low-income
persons and minority populations, counties, school administrators and nurses, health plans, and
health care providers;
    (2) be based on enrollment and renewal procedures best practices, including express lane
eligibility as required under subdivision 1d;
   (3) simplify the enrollment and renewal processes wherever possible; and
   (4) establish a process:
   (i) to disseminate information on medical assistance and MinnesotaCare to all children in the
public education system, including prekindergarten programs; and
  (ii) for the commissioner of human services to enroll children and other household members
who are eligible.

   The commissioner of human services in coordination with the commissioner of education
shall implement an open enrollment process by August 1, 2010, to be effective beginning with the
2010-2011 school year.
    (c) The commissioner and local agencies shall develop an online application process for medical
assistance and MinnesotaCare.
   (d) The commissioner shall develop an application that is easily understandable and does not
exceed four pages in length.
    (e) The commissioner of human services shall present to the legislature, by January 15, 2010,
an implementation plan for the open enrollment period and online application process.
    (f) To ensure parity between all providers of medical services in the ability to seek
reimbursement from MinnesotaCare or medical assistance, the commissioner of human services,
in consultation with the commissioner of education, shall include on new or revised enrollment
forms consent authorization language for all providers of medical services to the parent's child or
children, including schools, by incorporating language on the enrollment form that is consistent
with federal data practices laws requiring consent before a school may release information
from individual educational records. The consent language shall include a statement that the
medical services providers may share with the commissioner of human services medical or other
information in the possession of the provider that is necessary for the provider to be reimbursed
by MinnesotaCare or medical assistance. The consent language also shall state that information
may be shared from a child's individual educational records and that the parent may revoke the
consent for schools to share information from educational records at any time. The commissioner
shall include substantially similar consent authorization language on each of its other enrollment
forms as they are scheduled for review, revision, or replacement.
  EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval, which
must be requested by the commissioner, whichever is later.
   Sec. 14. THIRD-PARTY BILLING.
    To allow the cost effective billing of medical assistance for covered services that are not
reimbursed by other legally liable third parties, the commissioner of human services must:
    (1) summarize and document school district efforts to secure reimbursement from legally liable
third parties; and
    (2) request permission from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to allow school
districts to bill Medicaid alone, without first billing private payers, when:
   (i) a child has both public and private coverage; and
    (ii) documentation demonstrates that the private payer involved does not reimburse for
individualized education program health-related services.
   Sec. 15. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
    The revisor of statutes shall substitute the term "individualized education program" or similar
terms for "individual education plan" or similar terms wherever they appear in Minnesota
Statutes and Minnesota Rules referring to the requirements relating to the federal Individuals with

Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) finance code, by fiscal year. Upon approval through
the adoption of a resolution by each of an intermediate district's member school district boards and
the approval of the Department of Education, a school district may include its proportionate share
of the costs of health and safety projects for an intermediate district in its application.
    (b) Health and safety projects with an estimated cost of $500,000 or more per site are not eligible
for health and safety revenue. Health and safety projects with an estimated cost of $500,000 or more
per site that meet all other requirements for health and safety funding, are eligible for alternative
facilities bonding and levy revenue according to section 123B.59. A school board shall not separate
portions of a single project into components to qualify for health and safety revenue, and shall not
combine unrelated projects into a single project to qualify for alternative facilities bonding and levy
revenue.
   (c) The commissioner of education shall not make eligibility for health and safety revenue
contingent on a district's compliance status, level of program development, or training. The
commissioner shall not mandate additional performance criteria such as training, certifications, or
compliance evaluations as a prerequisite for levy approval.

   Subd. 3. Health and safety revenue. A district's health and safety revenue for a fiscal year
equals the district's alternative facilities levy under section 123B.59, subdivision 5, paragraph (b),
plus the greater of zero or:
    (1) the sum of (a) the total approved cost of the district's hazardous substance plan for fiscal
years 1985 through 1989, plus (b) the total approved cost of the district's health and safety program
for fiscal year 1990 through the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable, excluding expenditures
funded with bonds issued under section 123B.59 or 123B.62, or chapter 475; certificates of
indebtedness or capital notes under section 123B.61; levies under section 123B.58, 123B.59,
123B.63, or 126C.40, subdivision 1 or 6; and other federal, state, or local revenues, minus
    (2) the sum of (a) the district's total hazardous substance aid and levy for fiscal years 1985
through 1989 under sections 124.245 and 275.125, subdivision 11c, plus (b) the district's health and
safety revenue under this subdivision, for years before the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
    Subd. 4. Health and safety levy. To receive health and safety revenue, a district may levy an
amount equal to the district's health and safety revenue as defined in subdivision 3 multiplied by
the lesser of one, or the ratio of the quotient derived by dividing the adjusted net tax capacity of the
district for the year preceding the year the levy is certified by the adjusted marginal cost pupil units
in the district for the school year to which the levy is attributable, to $2,935.
   Subd. 5. Health and safety aid. A district's health and safety aid is the difference between its
health and safety revenue and its health and safety levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted, health and safety aid must be reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied. Health

safety costs associated with demolition of facilities, structural repair or replacement of facilities
due to unsafe conditions, violence prevention and facility security, ergonomics, or for building
and heating, ventilating and air conditioning supplies, maintenance, and cleaning activities. All
assessments, investigations, inventories, and support equipment not leading to the engineering or
construction of a project shall be included in the health, safety, and environmental management
costs in subdivision 8, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 6b. Health and safety projects. (a) Health and safety revenue applications defined in
subdivision 1 must be accompanied by a description of each project for which funding is being
requested. Project descriptions must provide enough detail for an auditor to determine if the work
qualifies for revenue. For projects other than fire and life safety projects, playground projects,
and health, safety, and environmental management activities, a project description does not need
to include itemized details such as material types, room locations, square feet, names, or license
numbers. The commissioner shall approve only projects that comply with subdivisions 6 and 8, as
defined by the Department of Education.
   (b) Districts may request funding for allowable projects based on self-assessments, safety
committee recommendations, insurance inspections, management assistance reports, fire marshal
orders, or other mandates. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and subdivision 8,
paragraph (b), for projects under $500,000, individual project size for projects authorized by this
subdivision is not limited and may include related work in multiple facilities. Health and safety
management costs from subdivision 8 may be reported as a single project.
   (c) All costs directly related to a project shall be reported in the appropriate Uniform Financial
Accounting and Reporting Standards (UFARS) finance code.
    (d) For fire and life safety egress and all other projects exceeding $20,000, cited under Minnesota
Fire Code, a fire marshal plan review is required.
   (e) Districts shall update project estimates with actual expenditures for each fiscal year. If a
project's final cost is significantly higher than originally approved, the commissioner may request
additional supporting information.
    Subd. 6c. Appeals process. In the event a district is denied funding approval for a project the
district believes complies with subdivisions 6 and 8, and is not otherwise excluded, a district may
appeal the decision. All such requests must be in writing. The commissioner shall respond in writing.
A written request must contain the following: project number; description and amount; reason for
denial; unresolved questions for consideration; reasons for reconsideration; and a specific statement
of what action the district is requesting.
    Subd. 7. Proration. In the event that the health and safety aid available for any year is prorated,
a district having its aid prorated may levy an additional amount equal to the amount not paid by the
state due to proration.
   Subd. 8. Health, safety, and environmental management cost. (a) "Health, safety, and
environmental management" is defined in section 123B.56.
   (b) A district's cost for health, safety, and environmental management is limited to the lesser of:
   (1) actual cost to implement their plan; or

     b­) (c) The department may contract with regional service organizations, private contractors,
Minnesota Safety Council, or state agencies to provide management assistance to school districts for
health and safety capital projects. Management assistance is the development of written programs
for the identification, recognition and control of hazards, and prioritization and scheduling of district
health and safety capital projects. The ­ d­

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided

that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
    (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $150 times
the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
     (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), for taxes payable in 2011 to 2021,
a district that is a member of the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data processing
joint board, that finds it economically advantageous to enter into a lease ­     pu­­

   (1) capacity and infrastructure;
   (2) application criteria and process;
   (3) contracting process;
   (4) ongoing oversight and evaluation processes; and
   (5) renewal criteria and processes.

regarding the granting of charters, which will include at least the following:
   (i) how the statutory purposes defined in subdivision 1 are addressed;

charter school board member, or other interested party. The commissioner, after completing the
review, shall transmit a report with findings to the authorizer. If, consistent with this section,
the commissioner finds that an authorizer has not fulfilled the requirements of this section, the
commissioner may subject the authorizer to corrective action, which may include terminating the
contract with the charter school board of directors of a school it chartered. The commissioner
must notify the authorizer in writing of any findings that may subject the authorizer to corrective
action and the authorizer then has 15 business days to request an informal hearing before the
commissioner takes corrective action.
    (h) The commissioner may at any time take corrective action against an authorizer, including
terminating an authorizer's ability to charter a school for:
   (1) failing to demonstrate the criteria under paragraph (c) under which the commissioner
approved the authorizer;
    (2) violating a term of the chartering contract between the authorizer and the charter school board
of directors; or
   (3) unsatisfactory performance as an approved authorizer.

or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall
apply to the school except as provided in this section.
    Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a school district, subject to this section and
section 124D.11, may create a corporation for the purpose of establishing a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may establish and operate a school, the authorizer must file an affidavit
with the commissioner stating its intent to charter a school. An authorizer must file a separate
affidavit for each school it intends to charter. The affidavit must state the terms and conditions
under which the authorizer would charter a school and how the authorizer intends to oversee the
fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of the written
contract between the authorizer and the charter school board of directors under subdivision 6.
The commissioner must approve or disapprove the authorizer's affidavit within 60 business days
of receipt of the affidavit. If the commissioner disapproves the affidavit, the commissioner shall
notify the authorizer of the deficiencies in the affidavit and the authorizer then has 20 business days
to address the deficiencies. If the authorizer does not address deficiencies to the commissioner's
satisfaction, the commissioner's disapproval is final. Failure to obtain commissioner approval
precludes an authorizer from chartering the school that is the subject of this affidavit.

                                             o­r as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must
establish a board of directors composed of at least five members who are not related parties until
a timely election for members of the ongoing charter school board of directors is held according
to the school's articles and bylaws under paragraph (f). A charter school board of directors must
be composed of at least five members who are not related parties. Staff members employed at the
school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents
or legal guardians of children enrolled in the school are the voters eligible to elect the members
of the school's board of directors. A charter school must notify eligible voters of the school board
election dates at least 30 days before the election. Board of director meetings must comply with
chapter 13D.
    (e) Upon the request of an individual, the charter school must make available in a timely fashion
the minutes of meetings of the board of directors, and of members and committees having any
board-delegated authority; financial statements showing all operations and transactions affecting
income, surplus, and deficit during the school's last annual accounting period; and a balance sheet
summarizing assets and liabilities on the closing date of the accounting period. A charter school also
must post on its official Web site information identifying its authorizer and indicate how to contact
that authorizer and include that same information about its authorizer in other school materials that
it makes available to the public.
    (f) Every charter school board member shall attend department-approved training on board
governance, the board's role and responsibilities, employment policies and practices, and financial
management. A board member who does not begin the required training within six months of
being seated and complete the required training within 12 months of being seated on the board is
ineligible to continue to serve as a board member.
    (g) The ongoing board must be elected before the school completes its third year of operation.
Board elections must be held during a time when school is in session. The charter school board
of directors shall be composed of at least five nonrelated members and include: (i) at least one
licensed teacher employed at the school or a licensed teacher providing instruction under a contact
between the charter school and a cooperative; (ii) the parent or legal guardian of a student enrolled
in the charter school; and (iii) an interested community member who is not employed by the charter
school and does not have a child enrolled in the school. The board may be a teacher majority
board composed of teachers described in this paragraph. The chief financial officer and the chief
administrator are ex-officio nonvoting board members. Board bylaws shall outline the process and
procedures for changing the board's governance model, consistent with chapter 317A. A board may
change its governance model only:
   (1) by a majority vote of the board of directors and the licensed teachers employed by the
school, including licensed teachers providing instruction under a contract between the school and a
cooperative; and

   (2) with the authorizer's approval.
   Any change in board governance must conform with the board structure established under this
paragraph.
   (h) The granting or renewal of a charter by an authorizer must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (i) The granting or renewal of a charter school by an authorizer must not be contingent on
the charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the authorizer.
Any potential contract, lease, or purchase of service from an authorizer must be disclosed to the
commissioner, accepted through an open bidding process, and be a separate contract from the
charter contract. The school must document the open bidding process. An authorizer must not enter
into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school that it authorizes, unless
the school documents that it received at least two competitive bids.
    (j) An authorizer may permit the board of directors of a charter school to expand the operation
of the charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those
described in the authorizer's original affidavit as approved by the commissioner only after submitting
a supplemental affidavit for approval to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The supplemental affidavit must show that:
   (1) the expansion proposed by the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
    (2) the charter school expansion is warranted, at a minimum, by longitudinal data demonstrating
students' improved academic performance and growth on statewide assessments under chapter
120B;
   (3) the charter school is fiscally sound and has the financial capacity to implement the proposed
expansion; and
   (4) the authorizer finds that the charter school has the management capacity to carry out its
expansion.
    (k) The commissioner shall have 30 business days to review and comment on the supplemental
affidavit. The commissioner shall notify the authorizer of any deficiencies in the supplemental
affidavit and the authorizer then has 30 business days to address, to the commissioner's satisfaction,
any deficiencies in the supplemental affidavit. The school may not expand grades or add sites
until the commissioner has approved the supplemental affidavit. The commissioner's approval or
disapproval of a supplemental affidavit is final.
    (l) A charter school approved and operating under this section shall not merge with another
charter school without prior approval from the commissioner. The merger shall comply with
chapter 317A and section 124D.11, subdivision 9, paragraph (g). The commissioner shall review
the proposed merger submitted by the proposed surviving charter school and approve or disapprove
the merger based on the following criteria:
   (1) the financial management plan, including the transfer of assets and liabilities;
   (2) the administration and operations plan;
   (3) the school's governance plan; and

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2009 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) An individual is prohibited from serving as a member of the
charter school board of directors if the individual, an immediate family member, or the individual's
partner is an owner, employee or agent of, or a contractor contracting with a for-profit ­   o­r entity, a
nonprofit entity, or an individual with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for
professional services, goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable
at the option of the commissioner or the charter school board of directors. A member of a charter
school board of directors who violates this prohibition is individually liable to the charter school for
any damage caused by the violation.
    (b) No member of the board of directors, employee, officer, or agent of a charter school shall
participate in selecting, awarding, or administering a contract if a conflict of interest exists. A conflict
exists when:
   (1) the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
   (2) the immediate family of the board member, employee, officer, or agent;
   (3) the partner of the board member, employee, officer, or agent; or
   (4) an organization that employs, or is about to employ any individual in clauses (1) to (3),
has a financial or other interest in the entity with which the charter school is contracting. A violation
of this prohibition renders the contract void.
     (c) Any employee, agent, or board member of the authorizer who participates in the initial review,
approval, ongoing oversight, evaluation, or the charter renewal or nonrenewal process or decision
is ineligible to serve on the board of directors of a school chartered by that authorizer.
   (d) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
    (e) A charter school board member must not receive any remuneration such as a fee-for-service
as part of a financial transaction involving the charter school. A charter school employee may receive
remuneration such as a fee-for-service as part of a financial transaction involving a charter school
only if the services for which the remuneration is paid are in addition to the services the employee
already agreed to provide to the charter school and the charter school board of directors formally
approve the remuneration.
    (f) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid
to a teacher employed by the charter school who also serves as a member of the board of directors.
   ­(­
     f­
      ) (g) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to a teacher who
provides services to a charter school through a cooperative formed under chapter 308A when the
teacher also serves on the charter school board of directors.

school board eligible to be an authorizer, other public organization, private, nonprofit nonsectarian
organization, private property owner, or a sectarian organization if the leased space is constructed as

subdivision 6. The authorizer may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground
listed in paragraph (b). An authorizer may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the
contract for any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating
a contract, the authorizer shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed
action in writing. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and
that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the
authorizer within 15 business days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract.
Failure by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 15-business-day
period shall be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written
request for a hearing, the authorizer shall give ten business days' notice to the charter school's board
of directors of the hearing date. The authorizer shall conduct an informal hearing before taking
final action. The authorizer shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract no later than 20
business days before the proposed date for terminating the contract or the end date of the contract.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;

    (c) If the sponsor and the charter school board of directors mutually agree to terminate or not
renew the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves the transfer
to a different eligible authorizer to authorize the charter school. Both parties must jointly submit
their intent in writing to the commissioner to mutually terminate the contract. The sponsor that is
a party to the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about
the fiscal and operational status and student performance of the school. Before the commissioner
determines whether to approve a transfer of authorizer, the commissioner first must determine
whether the charter school and prospective new authorizer can identify and effectively resolve
those circumstances causing the previous authorizer and the charter school to mutually agree to
terminate the contract. If no transfer of sponsor is approved, the school must be dissolved according
to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
    (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing authorizer, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing, may
terminate the existing contract between the authorizer and the charter school board if the charter
school has a history of:
   (1) failure to meet pupil performance requirements contained in the contract;
  (2) financial mismanagement or failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal
management; or
   (3) repeated or major violations of the law.

    The commissioner of administration, in conjunction with the commissioner of education, shall
annually publish a list of vacant and unused buildings and vacant and unused portions of buildings
that are owned by the state or by school districts in the state and that may be suitable for the
long-term operation of a charter school. The commissioner of education shall make the list available
to applicants for charter schools and to existing charter schools. The list shall include the address
of each building, a short description of the building, and the name of the owner of the building.
Nothing in this section requires the owner of a building on the list to sell or lease the building or a
portion of the building to a charter school or to any other school or to any other prospective buyer
or tenant. The commissioner of education may request information from school districts to compile
the vacant building list under this section. School districts must comply with the commissioner's

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.11, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General education revenue. (a) General education revenue must be paid to
a charter school as though it were a district. The general education revenue for each adjusted
marginal cost pupil unit is the state average general education revenue per pupil unit, plus the
referendum equalization aid allowance in the pupil's district of residence, minus an amount equal
to the product of the formula allowance according to section 126C.10, subdivision 2, times .0485,
calculated without basic skills revenue, extended time revenue, alternative teacher compensation
revenue, transition revenue, and transportation sparsity revenue, plus basic skills revenue, extended
time revenue, basic alternative teacher compensation aid according to section 126C.10, subdivision
34, and transition revenue as though the school were a school district. The general education
revenue for each extended time marginal cost pupil unit equals $4,378.
   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), for charter schools in the first year of operation, general
education revenue shall be computed using the number of adjusted pupil units in the current fiscal
year.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), general education revenue for a charter school receiving
facilities aid under subdivision 4a must be reduced by an amount equal to the greater of zero or the
difference between the school's facilities aid and the product of the pupil units served times:
   (1) for a school receiving building lease aid for fiscal year 2010, the lesser of $1,120 or the
school's building lease aid per pupil unit served for fiscal year 2010; or
   (2) for a school not receiving building lease aid for fiscal year 2010, $1,120.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.11, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Use of total operating capital revenue. (a) Notwithstanding section 126C.10,
subdivision 14, a charter school may use total operating capital revenue for any purpose related to
the school unless the charter school has been endorsed under section 124D.1106.
    (b) A charter school that has been endorsed under section 124D.1106 must reserve at least $100
per pupil of its annual operating capital revenue for capital repairs and replacement.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 124D.11, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Building lease aid. (a) When a charter school finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes and it determines that the total operating
capital revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply
to the commissioner for building lease aid for this purpose. The commissioner must review and
either approve or deny a lease aid application using the following criteria:
   (1) the reasonableness of the price based on current market values;
   (2) the extent to which the lease conforms to applicable state laws and rules; ­
                                                                                  an

    (3) the appropriateness of the proposed lease in the context of the space needs and financial
circumstances of the charter school;

   (iii) a copy of the lessor's annual audit or annual report, whichever applies;
   (iv) the terms of the proposed lease and a copy of the proposed lease;
   (v) the enrollment projections of the school;
   (vi) the long-range strategic and financial plan of the school;

    (ii) a statement from the lessee stating that its owner, board members, employees, or related
parties are not board members or employees or related to board members or employees of the

employees, or related parties of the charter school leasing the facility;
   (iii) an update to the long-range strategic and financial plan of the school; and
    (iv) a letter from the school's director certifying that there has been no change in any of the other
information listed in this paragraph, except as reported in the letter.
    (b) If the commissioner determines that a charter school has not provided information required
under this subdivision, the commissioner must deny the charter school's lease aid application under
this subdivision.
    (c) If the commissioner determines that the primary purpose of the organization proposing to
lease a building or land to the charter school is to provide a facility for the charter school, and (1)
the organization has financed the acquisition of the school facility through rent paid by the charter
school from building lease aid under this subdivision; or (2) the organization is maintaining the
school facility on behalf of the charter school through rent paid by the charter school's lease aid
under this subdivision, the commissioner must deny the charter school's lease aid application under
this subdivision.

or organization is not otherwise directly or indirectly controlled by board members, employees,
or related parties of the charter school leasing the facility. If the commissioner determines that a
charter school is proposing to lease under this paragraph for the purpose of purchasing a building
using building lease aid, the commissioner must deny the lease aid application.

facility will transfer to the charter school upon the maturity of the bonds or debt instruments used
to finance the school facility.
    (c) For fiscal year 2012 and later, for leases approved for building lease aid in the prior fiscal
year and not modified for the current fiscal year, any other information the commissioner requests

school facilities aid for an education site under subdivision 4a, is not eligible for building lease
transition aid for the same site under this subdivision. A charter school that received more than
$1,200 per pupil unit in lease aid for an education site under subdivision 4 for fiscal year 2010
must continue to receive that per pupil unit aid amount for education sites eligible for building lease
transition aid until that charter school receives facilities aid under subdivision 4a.

on or prior to June 30 of a school year, for the payment periods occurring after the school ceases

After receiving the closure plan, financial information, an audit of pupil counts, documentation
of lease expenditures, and monitoring of special education expenditures, the commissioner may
release cash withheld and may continue regular payments up to the current year payment percentages
if further amounts are owed. If, based on audits and monitoring, the school received state aid in
excess of the amount owed, the commissioner shall retain aid withheld sufficient to eliminate the
aid overpayment. For a charter school ceasing operations prior to, or at the end of, a school year,
notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, preliminary final payments may be made after
receiving the closure plan, audit of pupil counts, monitoring of special education expenditures,
documentation of lease expenditures, and school submission of Uniform Financial Accounting and
Reporting Standards (UFARS) financial data for the final year of operation. Final payment may be
made upon receipt of audited financial statements under section 123B.77, subdivision 3.
    (c) If a charter school fails to comply with the commissioner's directive to return, for cause,
federal or state funds administered by the department, the commissioner may withhold an amount
of state aid sufficient to satisfy the directive.
    (d) If, within the timeline under section 471.425, a charter school fails to pay the state of
Minnesota, a school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative after receiving an
undisputed invoice for goods and services, the commissioner may withhold an amount of state aid
sufficient to satisfy the claim and shall distribute the withheld aid to the interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or service cooperative. An interested state agency,
school district, intermediate school district, or education cooperative shall notify the commissioner
when a charter school fails to pay an undisputed invoice within 75 business days of when it
received the original invoice.
   (e) Notwithstanding section 127A.45, subdivision 3, and paragraph (a), 80 percent of the start-up
107TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                       12343

cost aid under subdivision 8 shall be paid within 45 days after the first day of student attendance for
that school year.
    (f) In order to receive state aid payments under this subdivision, a charter school in its first
three years of operation must submit a school calendar in the form and manner requested by the
department and a quarterly report to the Department of Education. The report must list each student
by grade, show the student's start and end dates, if any, with the charter school, and for any student
participating in a learning year program, the report must list the hours and times of learning year
activities. The report must be submitted not more than two weeks after the end of the calendar
quarter to the department. The department must develop a Web-based reporting form for charter
schools to use when submitting enrollment reports. A charter school in its fourth and subsequent
year of operation must submit a school calendar and enrollment information to the department in
the form and manner requested by the department.
    (g) Notwithstanding sections 317A.701 to 317A.791, upon closure of a charter school and
satisfaction of creditors, cash ­

shall be returned to the state. For mergers approved under section 124D.10, subdivision 4,
paragraph (l), a charter school may first sell at appraised market value or transfer its assets to a
school district or a charter school.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and may, until so used, be placed in

state. The full faith and credit and taxing powers of the state are not and may not be pledged for
the payment of debt obligations under this section or for any payment the state makes under section
124D.1109. No person may compel the levy of a tax for the payment or compel the appropriation

any bonds issued under this section are not affected by any determination that the interest on the
bonds is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the property or money or further act, and
the lien of any pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort,

pledge. Neither the order nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.
    Subd. 7. Bonds; purchase and cancellation. The authority, subject to agreements with
bondholders that may then exist, may, out of any money available for the purpose, purchase bonds
of the authority at a price not exceeding (1) if the bonds are then redeemable, the redemption price
then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment date thereon, or (2) if the bonds
are not redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first date after the purchase upon which
the bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest to that date.
    Subd. 8. State pledge against impairment of contracts. The state pledges and agrees with the
holders of any bonds that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the authority to fulfill the
terms of any agreements made with the bondholders, or in any way impair the rights and remedies of
the holders until the bonds, together with interest on them, with interest on any unpaid installments
of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of
the bondholders, are fully met and discharged. The authority may include this pledge and agreement
of the state in any agreement with the holders of bonds issued under this section.

  Sec. 24. [124D.1109] STATE PAYMENT OF ENDORSED CHARTER SCHOOL DEBT
OBLIGATION UPON POTENTIAL DEFAULT; REPAYMENT; STATE OBLIGATION
NOT DEBT.

the term "debt obligation" means bonds issued by the Charter School Facilities Authority under
section 124D.1108.
    Subd. 2. Notifications; payment; appropriation. (a) If an endorsed charter school believes that
it may be unable to pay the amount sufficient to permit the Charter School Facilities Authority to
make a principal or interest payment on an outstanding debt obligation on the date that payment is
due, it must notify the commissioner of education as soon as possible, but not less than 15 business
days before the date that principal or interest payment is due. The notice must include the name
of the endorsed charter school, an identification of the debt obligation issue in question, the date
the payment is due, the amount of principal or interest due on the payment date, the amount of
principal or interest that the endorsed charter school will be unable to repay on that date, the trustee
or paying agent for the debt obligation, the wire transfer instructions to transfer funds to that trustee
or paying agent, and an indication whether a payment is being requested by the endorsed charter
school under this section. If a trustee or paying agent becomes aware of a potential default, it shall
immediately inform the commissioner of education of that fact. After receipt of a notice that requests
a payment under this section, after consultation with the endorsed charter school and the trustee or
paying agent, and after verification of the accuracy of the information provided, the commissioner
of education shall notify the commissioner of management and budget of the potential default. The
notice must include a statement of the amount due that the endorsed charter school will be unable
to repay on the date due.
   (b) Except as provided in subdivision 6, upon receipt of this notice from the commissioner of
education, the commissioner of management and budget shall issue a warrant and authorize the
107TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                        12349

commissioner of education to pay to the trustee or paying agent for the debt obligation the specified
amount on or before the date due. The amounts needed for the purposes of this subdivision are
annually appropriated to the commissioner of education from the charter school credit enhancement
account in the special revenue fund in the state treasury.
    (c) The commissioners of education and management and budget must jointly develop detailed
procedures for endorsed charter schools to notify the state that they have obligated themselves to
be bound by the provisions of this section, procedures for endorsed charter schools and trustees and
paying agents to notify the state of potential defaults and to request state payment under this section,
and procedures for the state to expedite payments to prevent defaults. The procedures are not subject
to chapter 14.
    Subd. 3. Endorsed charter school bound; interest rate on state-paid amount. If, at the request
of an endorsed charter school, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on an
endorsed charter school's debt obligation on a specific date, the endorsed charter school is bound by
all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the date paid until
the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner of management
and budget. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding, less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4, and other payments received from the endorsed charter school.
    Subd. 4. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the
commissioner must reduce the state aid payable to the endorsed charter school under section
124D.11 by the amount paid by the commissioner under this section on behalf of the endorsed
charter school, plus the interest due on it, and the commissioner of management and budget shall
transfer the amount reduced from the appropriate account to the charter school facilities credit
enhancement account. No federal aid payments shall be reduced.
    (b) If, after review of the financial situation of the endorsed charter school, the commissioner
of education advises the commissioner of management and budget that a total reduction of aids
would cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the
endorsed charter school, the commissioner of education, with the approval of the commissioner of
management and budget, may establish a different schedule for reduction of aids to repay the state.
The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any amounts repaid to the state by the endorsed
charter school from other revenue sources.
    Subd. 5. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the commissioner makes payments on
behalf of an endorsed charter school under this section or the endorsed charter school defaults in
the payment of principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to
the commissioner of education for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to
resolve the issues that led to its inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The
commissioners must provide technical assistance to the endorsed charter school in preparing its
plan.
    Subd. 6. State bond rating. If the commissioner of management and budget determines that
issuing warrants under subdivision 2 would adversely affect the credit rating of the state, the
commissioner of management and budget shall not issue warrants for the payment of principal or
interest on debt obligations under this section.
  Subd. 7. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of management and budget
may enter into written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information
12350                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [107TH DAY

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2471 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 2471 be further amended as
follows:
     Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
     "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 10A.01, subdivision 18, is amended to read:
    Subd. 18. Independent expenditure. "Independent expenditure" means an expenditure
expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, if the expenditure is
made without the express or implied consent, authorization, or cooperation of, and not in concert
with or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate or any candidate's principal campaign
committee or agent. An independent expenditure is not a contribution to that candidate. A                                             ­­n

inconsistent requirements;
    (iii) terminating unfunded state mandates that are duplicative, obsolete, or lacking in practical

   (10) facilitate proposals for grants made by eligible applicants; and
    (11) make recommendations on topics to the Legislative Audit Commission for program
evaluations that are likely to result in recommendations that will improve the cost-effective

   Sec. 4. [465.7903] RULE AND LAW WAIVER REQUESTS.
    Subdivision 1. Generally. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a local government unit or
a nonprofit organization may request the Minnovation Council to grant a waiver from one or more
administrative rules or a temporary, limited exemption from enforcement of state procedural laws
governing delivery of services by the local government unit or nonprofit organization. Two or more
local government units may submit a joint application for a waiver or exemption under this section
if they propose to cooperate in providing a service or program that is subject to the rule or law.
Before a local unit of government may submit an application to the council, the governing body of
the local government unit must approve, in concept, the proposed waiver or exemption at a meeting
required to be public under chapter 13D. A waiver or exemption granted to a nonprofit organization
under this section applies to services provided to all of the organization's clients.
107TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                        12377

    (b) A school district that is granted a variance from rules of the commissioner of education
under section 122A.163 need not apply to the council for a waiver of those rules under this section. A
school district may not seek a waiver of rules under this section if the commissioner of education has
authority to grant a variance to the rules under section 122A.163. This paragraph does not preclude a
school district from being included in a cooperative effort with another local government unit under
this section.
   Subd. 2. Application. (a) A local government unit or nonprofit organization requesting a
waiver of a rule or exemption from enforcement of a law under this section shall present a written
application to the council. The application must include:
   (1) identification of the service or program at issue;
    (2) identification of the administrative rule or the law imposing a procedural requirement with
respect to which the waiver or exemption is sought; and
    (3) a description of the improved service outcome sought, including an explanation of the effect
of the waiver or exemption in accomplishing that outcome.
    (b) A local government unit submitting an application must provide a copy to the exclusive
representative certified under section 179A.12 to represent employees who provide the service or
program affected by the requested waiver or exemption.
    Subd. 3. Review process. (a) Upon receipt of an application, the council shall commence review
of the application, as provided in this subdivision. The council shall dismiss an application if it finds
that the application proposes a waiver of rules or exemption from enforcement of laws that would
result in due process violations, violations of federal law or the state or federal constitution, or the
loss of services to people who are entitled to them. If the council does not dismiss an application,
the council must publish notice in the State Register before it acts on the application. The notice
must list the name of the local government unit or nonprofit organization requesting the waiver or
exemption, the service or program at issue, and the rule or law with respect to which the waiver of
exemption is sought.
    (b) The council shall determine whether a law from which an exemption for enforcement
is sought is a procedural law, specifying how a local government unit or nonprofit organization
is to achieve an outcome, rather than a substantive law prescribing the outcome or otherwise
establishing policy. For the purposes of this section, "procedural law" does not include a statutory
notice requirement. For purposes of this section, "procedural law" may not include any provision
related to voting or elections. In making its determination, the council shall consider whether the
law specifies such requirements as:
   (1) who must deliver a service;
   (2) where the service must be delivered;
   (3) to whom and in what form reports regarding the service must be made; and
   (4) how long or how often the service must be made available to a given recipient.
   (c) If a member of the council also is a commissioner, a commissioner's designee, or the state
auditor, or is employed by an agency with jurisdiction over a rule or law affected by an application,
12378                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [107TH DAY

the member must not participate in the decision on the particular waiver or exemption.
    (d) If the application is submitted by a local government unit or a nonprofit organization in the
metropolitan area or the unit or nonprofit organization requests a waiver of a rule or temporary,
limited exemptions from enforcement of a procedural law over which the Metropolitan Council or a
metropolitan agency has jurisdiction, the council shall also transmit a copy of the application to the
Metropolitan Council for review and comment. The Metropolitan Council shall report its comments
to the council within 60 days of the date the application was transmitted to the Metropolitan Council.
The Metropolitan Council may point out any resources or technical assistance it may be able to
provide a local government unit or nonprofit organization submitting a request under this section.
    (e) Within 15 days after receipt of the application, the council shall transmit a copy of it to
the commissioner of each agency having jurisdiction over a rule or law from which a waiver or
exemption is sought. The agency may mail a notice that it has received an application for a waiver
or exemption to all persons who have registered with the agency under section 14.14, subdivision
1a, identifying the rule or law from which a waiver or exemption is requested. If no agency has
jurisdiction over the rule or law, the council shall transmit a copy of the application to the attorney
general. The agency shall inform the council of its agreement with or objection to and grounds for
objection to the waiver or exemption request within 60 days of the date when the application was
transmitted to it. An agency's failure to respond under this paragraph is considered agreement to the
waiver or exemption. The council shall decide whether to grant a waiver or exemption at its next
regularly scheduled meeting following its receipt of an agency's response or the end of the 60-day
response period. If consideration of an application is not concluded at that meeting, the matter may
be carried over to the next meeting of the council. Interested persons may submit written comments
and requests to present oral comments to the council on the waiver or exemption request up to the
time of its vote on the application.
    (f) If the exclusive representative of the affected employees of the requesting local government
unit objects to the waiver or exemption request, it may inform the council of the objection to and
the grounds for the objection to the waiver or exemption request within 60 days of the receipt of the
application.
    Subd. 4. Hearing. If the agency or the exclusive representative does not agree with the waiver
or exemption request, the council shall set a date for a hearing on the application. The hearing must
be conducted informally at a meeting of the council. Persons representing the local government
unit shall present their request for the waiver or exemption, and a representative from the agency
shall explain the agency's objection to the waiver or exemption. Members of the council may
request additional information from either party. The council may also request, either before or at
the hearing, information or comments from representatives of business, labor, local governments,
state agencies, consultants, and members of the public. If a member of the public requests to
present comments or information at the hearing, the council must permit the member of the public
an opportunity to present the comments or information. If necessary, the hearing may be continued
at a subsequent council meeting. A waiver or exemption requires a majority vote of the council
members. The council may modify the terms of the waiver or exemption request in arriving at the
agreement required under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 5. Conditions of agreements. (a) If the council grants a request for a waiver or exemption,
the council and the entity making the request shall enter into an agreement providing for the delivery
of the service or program that is the subject of the application. The agreement must specify desired
107TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                        12379

outcomes and the means of measurement by which the council will determine whether the outcomes
specified in the agreement have been met. The agreement must specify the duration of the waiver
or exemption. The duration of a waiver from an administrative rule may be for no less than two
years and no more than four years, subject to renewal if both parties agree. An exemption from
enforcement of a law terminates ten days after adjournment of the regular legislative session held
during the calendar year following the year when the exemption is granted, unless the legislature
has acted to extend or make permanent the exemption.
    (b) If the council grants a waiver or exemption, it must report the waiver or exemption to the
legislature, including the chairs of the governmental operations and appropriate policy committees
in the house of representatives and senate, and the governor within 30 days.
    (c) The council may reconsider or renegotiate the agreement if the rule or law affected by the
waiver or exemption is amended or repealed during the term of the original agreement. A waiver
of a rule under this section has the effect of a variance granted by an agency under section 14.055.
The recipient of an exemption from enforcement of a procedural requirement in state law under this
section is exempt from that law for the duration of the exemption. The council may require periodic
reports from the recipient, or conduct investigations of the service or program.
    Subd. 6. Enforcement. If the council finds that the recipient of a waiver or an exemption
has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement under subdivision 5, it may rescind the
agreement. After an agreement is rescinded, the recipient is subject to the rules and laws covered
by the agreement.
    Subd. 7. Access to data. If the recipient of a waiver or an exemption through a cooperative
program under this section gains access to data that is classified as not public, the access to and use
of the data for the recipient is governed by the same restrictions on access to and use of the data that
apply to the unit that collected, created, received, or maintained the data.
   Sec. 5. [465.7904] WAIVERS OF STATE RULES; POLICIES.
   Subdivision 1. Application. A state agency may apply to the council for a waiver from:
    (1) an administrative rule or policy adopted by the commissioner of management and budget
that deals with the state personnel system;
    (2) an administrative rule or policy of the commissioner of administration that deals with the
state procurement system; or
    (3) a policy of the commissioner of management and budget that deals with the state accounting
system.
    Two or more state agencies may submit a joint application. A waiver application must identify
the rule or policy at issue, and must describe the improved outcome sought through the waiver.
    Subd. 2. Review process. (a) The council shall review all applications submitted under this
section. The council shall dismiss an application if it finds that the application proposes a waiver that
would result in due process violations, violations of federal law or the state or federal constitution,
or the loss of services to people who are entitled to them. If a proposed waiver would violate the
terms of a collective bargaining agreement effective under chapter 179A, the waiver is not effective
without the consent of the exclusive representative that is a party to the agreement. The council
12380                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [107TH DAY

may approve a waiver only if the council determines that if the waiver is granted: (1) services can
be provided in a more efficient or effective manner; and (2) services related to human resources
must be provided in a manner consistent with section 43A.01. In the case of a waiver from a policy
of the commissioner of management and budget, the council may approve the waiver only if it
determines that services will be provided in a more efficient or effective manner and that state funds
will be adequately accounted for and safeguarded in a manner that complies with generally accepted
government accounting principles.
    (b) Within 15 days of receipt of the application, the council shall send a copy of the application to:
(1) the agency whose rule or policy is involved; and (2) all exclusive representatives who represent
employees of the agency requesting the waiver. The agency whose rule or policy is involved may
mail a copy of the application to all persons who have registered with the agency under section
14.14, subdivision 1a.
   (c) The agency whose rule or policy is involved or an exclusive representative shall notify the
council of its agreement with or objection to and grounds for objection to the waiver within 60
days of the date when the application was transmitted to the agency or the exclusive representative.
An agency's or exclusive representative's failure to respond under this paragraph is considered
agreement to the waiver.
    (d) If the agency or the exclusive representative objects to the waiver, the council shall schedule
a meeting at which the agency requesting the waiver may present its case for the waiver and the
objecting party may respond. The council shall decide whether to grant a waiver at its next regularly
scheduled meeting following its receipt of an agency's response, or the end of the 60-day response
period, whichever occurs first. If consideration of an application is not concluded at the meeting,
the matter may be carried over to the next meeting of the council. Interested persons may submit
written comments to the council on the waiver request.
    (e) If the council grants a request for a waiver, the council and the agency requesting the waiver
shall enter into an agreement relating to the outcomes desired as a result of the waiver and the
means of measurement to determine whether those outcomes have been achieved with the waiver.
The agreement must specify the duration of the waiver, which must be for at least two years and not
more than four years. If the council determines that an agency that has received a waiver is failing
to comply with the terms of the agreement, the council may rescind the agreement.
    Subd. 3. Participation. If a waiver request involves a rule or policy adopted by an official
specified in section 465.7902, subdivision 1, clauses (3) to (7), that official may not participate
in the evaluation of that waiver request.
   Sec. 6. [465.7905] INNOVATION AND REDESIGN GRANTS.
    Subdivision 1. Application. One or more local units of government, an association of local
governments, the Metropolitan Council, a local unit of government acting in conjunction with an
organization or a state agency, an organization established by two or more local units of government
under a joint powers agreement, or a not-for-profit organization may apply to the Minnovation
Council for a grant to be used to: (1) develop models for service redesign; or (2) meet the start-up
costs of providing shared services or functions. Agreements solely to make joint purchases do not
qualify for grants. The application must specify a nonstate funding source for 25 percent of the
total cost of the proposal. The application to the council must state what other sources of funding
have been considered by the local units of government to implement the project and explain why
107TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                       12381

it is not possible to complete the project without assistance from the council. The council may not
award a grant if it determines that the local units of government could complete the project without
council assistance or if it determines the applicant has not specified a nonstate funding source for
25 percent of the total cost. A copy of the application must be provided by the units to the exclusive
representatives certified under section 179A.12 to represent employees who provide the service or
program affected by the application.
    Subd. 2. Proposals. (a) Proposed models for service redesign may provide options to local
governments, neighborhood or community organizations, other not-for-profit organizations, or
individuals to redesign service delivery. In awarding grants under this paragraph, the council must
consider whether the proposal:
   (1) expands consumer choices and opportunities;
   (2) shifts government toward an expanded role as a purchaser, rather than a provider, of services;
   (3) reduces administrative costs through statewide or regional contracting, or related
administrative efficiencies;
    (4) reduces administrative costs through the accumulation of multiple related services into a
single contract with one provider, or related administrative efficiencies;
   (5) fosters entrepreneurial leadership in the public sector; and
   (6) increases value to the taxpayer or results per dollar spent.
    (b) A proposal for a grant for shared services or functions must include plans to fully integrate
a service or function provided by two or more local government units. The proposal must include
how value for the taxpayer or results per dollar spent will be impacted.
    Subd. 3. Requirements. A copy of the work product for which the grant was provided must
be furnished to the council upon completion, and the council may disseminate it to other local
units of government or interested groups. If the council finds that the work was not completed or
implemented according to the terms of the grant agreement, it may require the grantee to repay all
or a portion of the grant. The council shall award grants on the basis of each qualified applicant's
score under the scoring system in section 465.7906. The amount of a grant under subdivision 2,
paragraph (a), may not exceed $250,000. The amount of a grant under subdivision 2, paragraph (b),
may not exceed $100,000.
   Sec. 7. [465.7906] SCORING SYSTEM.
   In deciding whether to award a grant under section 465.7905, the council shall use the following
scoring system:
    (1) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application demonstrates
creative thinking, careful planning, cooperation, involvement of the clients of the affected service,
and commitment to persist through challenges.
    (2) Up to 25 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the proposed project is likely
to improve the quality of the service, increase value to the taxpayers or results per dollar spent, and
to have benefits for other local governments.
12382                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [107TH DAY

    (3) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application's budget
provides sufficient detail, maximizes the use of state funds, documents the need for financial
assistance, commits to local financial support, and limits expenditures to essential activities.
    (4) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the extent to which the application reflects the
statutory goal of the grant program.
    (5) Up to 15 points must be awarded to reflect the merit of the proposed project and the extent
to which it warrants the state's financial participation.
   (6) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the cost to benefit ratio projected for the proposed
project.
    (7) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the number of government units participating in
the proposal.
   (8) Up to five points must be awarded to reflect the minimum length of time the application
commits to implementation.
   Sec. 8. [465.7907] REPAYMENT OF GRANTS.
    Subdivision 1. Repayment procedures. Without regard to whether a grant recipient offered to
repay the grant in its original application, as part of a grant awarded under section 465.7905, the
council may require the grant recipient to repay all or part of the grant if the council determines
the project funded by the grant resulted in an actual savings for the participating local units of
government. The grant agreement must specify how the savings are to be determined and the period
of time over which the savings will be used to calculate a repayment requirement. The repayment
of grant money under this section must not exceed an amount equal to the total savings achieved
through the implementation of the project.
    Subd. 2. Bonus points. In addition to the points awarded to competitive grant applications under
section 465.7906, the council shall award additional points to any applicant that projects a potential
cost savings through the implementation of its project and offers to repay part or all of the grant
under the formula in subdivision 1.
    Subd. 3. Use of repayment revenue. All grant money repaid to the council under this section
is appropriated to the council for additional grants authorized by section 465.7905.
   Sec. 9. [465.7908] RECEIPTS; APPROPRIATION.
    (a) The council may charge a fee for the use of services provided by the council's staff. The
receipts from fees charged under this section are deposited in a special revenue account and
appropriated to the council for services provided under sections 465.7901 to 465.7908.
    (b) The council may accept gifts and grants. Money received under this paragraph is deposited
in a special revenue account and appropriated to the council for services provided under sections
465.7901 to 465.7908.
  Sec. 10. [465.7909] ANNUAL COUNCIL REPORT ON INNOVATION AND
GUARANTEEING INCREASED VALUE TO THE TAXPAYER.
   Subdivision 1. Report. The council shall report by January 15 each year to the governor and
107TH DAY]                          SUNDAY, MAY 16, 2010                                      12383

appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate on its activities. The report shall
include the amount of the council's net spending, the amount of savings and the increased outcomes
to the taxpayer that was identified by the council, and the actual documented savings to state and
local governments. Entities receiving grants or waivers from the council must document and verify
savings to the taxpayer from the previous year's budgets.
   Subd. 2. Savings and increased value. The council must make every effort to obtain $3 in
savings and show increased value to the taxpayer for each net state dollar spent by the council.
    Subd. 3. Innovative practices. The council shall promote and drive innovative practices and
must make annual recommendations to the legislature. One or all of these recommendations may
be in partnership with an individual, foundations, nonprofits, or businesses. The council may make
endorsements of proposals of individuals, foundations, nonprofits, or businesses when making
recommendations. The council must make annual recommendations to:
    (1) recommend at least $20 in savings and show increased outcomes to the taxpayer for each net
state dollar spent by the council. These savings may be spread out over various budget items;
   (2) recommend policy changes that will quantifiably improve desired outcome attainment to the
taxpayer as compared to dollars spent. This shall not be limited to efficiency but may also include
developing new approaches to achieve desired outcomes;
   (3) highlight existing innovative practices or partnerships in the state; and
   (4) recommend innovative models, which may include state and local government structural
redesign, from across the country to the legislature; highlight innovative practices from past or
contemporary reports; recommend evidence-based service delivery methods for this state; or
recommend theory-based working models of approaches to policy.
