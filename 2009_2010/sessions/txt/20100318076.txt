purchase and installation costs, based on the amount of energy saved and estimated future energy
prices.
   Subd. 4. Energy improvement. "Energy improvement" means:
    (1) any renovation or retrofitting of a building to improve energy efficiency that is permanently
affixed to the property and that results in a net reduction in energy consumption without altering the
principal source of energy; or

described in section 13.82, subdivision 1, or an equivalent agency in another state.
    Subd. 2. Classification of data from other states. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c),
when a law enforcement agency in Minnesota receives investigative data from a law enforcement
agency in another state, the data are classified in Minnesota in a manner that is the equivalent to
the data classification or treatment of the data in the other state that applies at the time a request for
access to the data in Minnesota is made.
   (b) When investigative data classified under paragraph (a) become part of an active criminal
investigation in Minnesota involving an adult, the data are classified as provided in section 13.82.
    (c) When investigative data classified under paragraph (a) become part of an active juvenile
delinquency investigation in Minnesota involving a child, the data are governed by section
260B.171, subdivision 4 or 5.
    Subd. 3. Sharing authorized. If a Minnesota law enforcement agency receives investigative
data that are classified as not public under subdivision 2, paragraph (a), the data may be shared with
other law enforcement agencies if the data are pertinent and necessary to the receiving agency in
initiating, furthering, or completing an investigation.
    Subd. 4. Transaction record. A Minnesota law enforcement agency that receives or
disseminates data that are classified as not public under subdivision 2, paragraph (a), shall maintain
a record of each receipt or dissemination of the data."

    (j) Exit sign illumination. For a new building on which construction is begun on or after
October 1, 1993, or an existing building on which remodeling affecting 50 percent or more of the
enclosed space is begun on or after October 1, 1993, the code must prohibit the use of internally
illuminated exit signs whose electrical consumption during nonemergency operation exceeds 20
watts of resistive power. All other requirements in the code for exit signs must be complied with.
    (k) Exterior wood decks, patios, and balconies. The code must permit the decking surface
and upper portions of exterior wood decks, patios, and balconies to be constructed of (1) heartwood
from species of wood having natural resistance to decay or termites, including redwood and cedars,
(2) grades of lumber which contain sapwood from species of wood having natural resistance to
decay or termites, including redwood and cedars, or (3) treated wood. The species and grades of
wood products used to construct the decking surface and upper portions of exterior decks, patios,
and balconies must be made available to the building official on request before final construction
approval.
    (l) Bioprocess piping and equipment. No permit fee for bioprocess piping may be imposed
by municipalities under the State Building Code, except as required under section 326B.92
subdivision 1. Permits for bioprocess piping shall be according to section 326B.92 administered
by the Department of Labor and Industry. All data regarding the material production processes,
including the bioprocess system's structural design and layout, are nonpublic data as provided by
section 13.7911.
    (m) Use of ungraded lumber. The code must allow the use of ungraded lumber in geographic
areas of the state where the code did not generally apply as of April 1, 2008, to the same extent that
ungraded lumber could be used in that area before April 1, 2008.
    (n) Electrical code and agricultural buildings. Requirements under Article 547 of the National
Electrical Code shall be required only when there is a demonstrated risk resulting from the presence
of excessive accumulations of dust and dust with water where a corrosive atmosphere exists, or in
animal confinement buildings housing animals sensitive to small voltage gradients.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 326B.121, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Municipal enforcement. (a) If, as of January 1, 2008, a municipality has in effect
an ordinance adopting the State Building Code, that municipality must continue to administer and
enforce the State Building Code within its jurisdiction. The municipality is prohibited from repealing
its ordinance adopting the State Building Code. This paragraph does not apply to municipalities
with a population of less than 2,500 according to the last federal census that are located outside of
a metropolitan county, as defined in section 473.121, subdivision 4.
    (b) If a municipality is not required by paragraph (a) to administer and enforce the State Building
Code, the municipality may choose to administer and enforce the State Building Code within its
jurisdiction by adopting the code by ordinance.
   (c) A municipality must not by ordinance, or through development agreement, require building
code provisions regulating components or systems of any structure that are different from any
provision of the State Building Code. This subdivision does not prohibit a municipality from
8006                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [76TH DAY

requiring existing components or systems of any structure to be maintained in good repair, but not
exceeding the provisions under which the structure was built, unless specific retroactive provisions
for existing buildings have been adopted as part of the State Building Code. A municipality may,
with the approval of the state building official, adopt an ordinance that is more restrictive than
the State Building Code where geological conditions warrant a more restrictive ordinance. A
municipality may appeal the disapproval of a more restrictive ordinance to the commissioner.
An appeal under this subdivision is subject to the schedule, fee, procedures, cost provisions, and
appeal rights set out in section 326B.139.
    (d) A city may by ordinance and with permission of the township board extend the administration
and enforcement of the code to contiguous unincorporated territory not more than two miles distant
from its corporate limits in any direction if the code is not already administered and enforced in the
territory. Where two or more noncontiguous cities, which have elected to administer and enforce
the code, have boundaries less than four miles apart, each is authorized to enforce the code on its
side of a line equidistant between them. Once enforcement authority is extended extraterritorially
by ordinance, the authority may continue to be exercised in the designated territory even though
another city less than four miles distant later elects to enforce the code. After the extension, the
city may enforce the code in the designated area to the same extent as if the property were situated
within its corporate limits. Enforcement of the code in an extended area outside a city's corporate
limits includes all rules, laws, and ordinances associated with administration of the code.
    (e) A city cannot commence administration and enforcement of the code outside of its
jurisdiction until it has provided written notice to the commissioner, the county auditor, and the
town clerk of each town in which it intends to administer and enforce the code. A public hearing on
the proposed administration and enforcement must be held not less than 30 days after the notice has
been provided. Administration and enforcement of the code by the city outside of its jurisdiction
commences on a date determined by the city that is no less than 90 days nor more than one year
after the public hearing.
    (f) A municipality may enforce the State Building Code by any means that are convenient
and lawful, including entering into contracts with other municipalities under section 471.59 and
with qualified individuals. The other municipalities or qualified individuals may be reimbursed by
retention or remission of some or all of the building permit fee collected or by other means. If a
municipality has no qualified employees of the municipality or other municipalities or qualified
individuals available to carry out inspection and enforcement, the commissioner shall train and
designate individuals available to carry out inspection and enforcement. The commissioner may
be reimbursed for the inspection by retention or remission of some or all of the building permit
fee collected or by other means.
   (g) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits a municipality from adopting ordinances relating to
zoning, subdivision, or planning unless the ordinance conflicts with a provision of the State Building
Code that regulates components or systems of any structure."

previous year's levy limit computed under section 275.71, must be deducted from the levy limit base
under section 275.71, subdivision 2, in determining the city's or county's current year levy limit;

and thereafter, the total aid for any city means the amount of aid it was certified to receive under
this section in the previous payable year.
    (c) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for any city shall not exceed the sum of
(1) ten percent of the city's net levy for the year prior to the aid distribution plus (2) its total aid in
the previous year. For aids payable in 2009 and thereafter, the total aid for any city with a population
of 2,500 or more may not be less than its total aid under this section in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or ten percent of its net levy in the year prior to the aid
distribution.
    (d) For aids payable in 2010 and thereafter, the total aid for a city with a population less than
2,500 must not be less than the amount it was certified to receive in the previous year minus the
lesser of $10 multiplied by its population, or five percent of its 2003 certified aid amount. For aids
payable in 2009 only, the total aid for a city with a population less than 2,500 must not be less than
what it received under this section in the previous year unless its total aid in calendar year 2008 was
aid under section 477A.011, subdivision 36, paragraph (s), in which case its minimum aid is zero.
    (e) A city's aid loss under this section may not exceed $300,000 in any year in which the total city
aid appropriation under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, is equal or greater than the appropriation
under that subdivision in the previous year, unless the city has an adjustment in its city net tax
capacity under the process described in section 469.174, subdivision 28.
    (f) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2011 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 6. [477A.0133] ADDITIONAL 2010 AID AND CREDIT REDUCTIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the
meanings given them in this subdivision.
    (b) The "2010 revenue base" for a county is the sum of the county's certified property tax levy
for taxes payable in 2010, plus the amount of county program aid under section 477A.0124 that the
county was certified to receive in 2010, plus the amount of taconite aids under sections 298.28 and
298.282 that the county was certified to receive in 2010 including any amounts required to be placed
in a special fund for distribution in a later year.
    (c) The "2010 revenue base" for a statutory or home rule charter city is the sum of the city's
certified property tax levy for taxes payable in 2010, plus the amount of local government aid under
section 477A.013, subdivision 9, that the city was certified to receive in 2010, plus the amount
of taconite aids under sections 298.28 and 298.282 that the city was certified to receive in 2010
including any amounts required to be placed in a special fund for distribution in a later year.
    Subd. 2. 2010 reductions; counties, and cities. The commissioner of revenue must compute
additional 2010 aid and credit reimbursement reduction amounts for each county and city under
this section, after implementing any reduction of county program aid under section 477A.0124,
76TH DAY]                                   THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2010                                                           8037

local government aid under section 477A.013, or market value credit reimbursements under section
273.1384, to reflect the reduction of allotments under section 16A.152.
   The additional reduction amounts under this section are limited to the sum of the amount of
county program aid under section 477A.0124, local government aid under section 477A.013, and
market value credit reimbursements under section 273.1384 payable to the county or city in 2010
before the reductions in this section, but after the reductions for unallotments.
    The reduction amount under this section is applied first to reduce the amount payable to the
county or city in 2010 as market value credit reimbursements under section 273.1384, and then if
necessary, to reduce the amount payable as either county program aid under section 477A.0124 in
the case of a county, or local government aid under section 477A.013 in the case of a city.
    No aid or reimbursement amount is reduced to less than zero under this section.
   The additional 2010 aid reduction amount for a county is equal to 1.85803 percent of the county's
2010 revenue base. The additional 2010 aid reduction amount for a city is equal to the lesser of (1)
3.4287 percent of the city's 2010 revenue base or (2) $28 multiplied by the city's 2008 population.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

read:
    Subd. 7. Access to GAP policy. (a) In addition to other coverage required to be available
under this section, a health plan that provides group health coverage to an employer must contain
a provision which provides to every covered employee eligible for continuation health coverage
under subdivision 1 the right to obtain from the health carrier a GAP policy under this subdivision,
without first enrolling in and completing continuation coverage. The employer, or health carrier
on behalf of the employer, must provide the former employee with written notice of the former
employee's rights under this subdivision at the same time the employer provides notice of the
former employee's rights under subdivisions 1 to 5. Coverage under this subdivision must be offered
to any person to whom continuation coverage must be offered under federal law or Minnesota law.
    (b) The individual GAP policies available to a former employee, including coverage for any
previously covered dependent at the option of the former employee, must be at least the following
options:
    (1) annual deductible of $1,000 per individual, 80 percent coverage above the deductible subject
to an annual $10,000 limit on out-of-pocket costs, and further subject to a $1,000,000 lifetime
maximum benefit per individual;
   (2) a qualified high-deductible health plan compatible with a health savings account; and
   (3) an annual deductible of $10,000 or $15,000 per individual, with 100 percent coverage above
those deductibles, subject to a minimum $1,000,000 lifetime limit per individual.
   (c) The insurer must not consider the insurer's loss experience under policies issued under this
subdivision in determining the premium or any other feature of the employer's group coverage.
   (d) A former employee is not eligible for GAP coverage under this subdivision if the former
employee has enrolled in continuation coverage under subdivisions 1 to 5. An election to receive
coverage under this subdivision must be made no later than the deadline for electing continuation
coverage under subdivisions 1 to 5.
    (e) A person enrolled in GAP coverage under this subdivision may continue to renew that
coverage until the person becomes eligible for group health coverage as an employee or dependent
or for 18 months, whichever is earlier. After 18 months, the former employee is eligible for
Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association coverage without a preexisting condition limitation
under section 62E.14, subdivision 4c, paragraph (a).
