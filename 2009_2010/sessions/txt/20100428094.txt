    "Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to reaffirm the impartiality of the judiciary by
providing that all judges be appointed by the governor, with their continuation in office determined
at a retention election after a public, nonpartisan evaluation of their performance by a judicial
performance evaluation commission rather than be determined under the current system of
contested elections?

Following completion of their terms, these judges are subject to the retention election process as
provided in the constitution and may file for retention following the procedures described in article
2.

retention, facilitate self-improvement of all judges, and promote public accountability of the
judiciary.
    Subd. 3. Composition; appointment of commission members. (a) The commission is
composed of 24 members. All members of the commission must be residents of Minnesota at the
time of their appointment and for the duration of their term. Sitting judges and public officials,

sequence. Legislative appointees serve on the commission for a two-year term.
    In the case of a vacancy on the commission, the authority who appointed the member whose
seat has become vacant shall appoint a person to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired
term.
   (c) In making appointments, the governor, Supreme Court, and the legislature must consider the
diversity of the state's population, as well as the importance of balanced geographic representation,
and appoint individuals of outstanding competence and reputation. The governor, Supreme Court,
and the legislature should consult with one another to ensure the requirements of this paragraph are
met.
    (d) Members shall perform their duties in an impartial and objective manner and shall base
their recommendations solely upon matters that are in the record developed by the commission. A
member who violates this paragraph may be removed from the commission by majority vote of the
commission's membership.
   (e) A member may be removed by the appointing authority at any time for cause, after notice
and hearing, or after missing three consecutive meetings. After a member misses two consecutive

    Subd. 4. Meetings and data. Meetings of the Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation
Commission are subject to the requirements of chapter 13D, except that a meeting held to evaluate
the performance of a judge may only be closed to discuss issues related to the judge's health or
allegations against the judge that may be defamatory. The commission is subject to the requirements
of chapter 13. Except as otherwise provided in this section, data of the commission are public data
pursuant to section 13.03, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 5. Standards and procedures. (a) The Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation
Commission shall develop written standards, subject to approval of the Supreme Court in their
entirety, by which judicial performance is to be evaluated. The standards must be periodically
updated and must include knowledge of the law, procedure, integrity, impartiality, temperament,
respect for litigants, respect for the rule of law, administrative skill, punctuality, and communication
skills. The commission may not evaluate judicial performance based on substantive legal issues or
opinions that are subject to standard appellate processes.
   (b) The commission shall adopt procedures for collecting information and conducting reviews
and shall create and implement a program of periodic review of the performance of each judge. The
commission must request public comment on these procedures before their adoption.
    Subd. 6. Surveys. (a) Midway through a judge's term and again no fewer than nine months
before the date of the election for retention of the judge's position, the commission must distribute
anonymous survey forms eliciting performance evaluations of the judge to a representative sampling
of attorneys, litigants, other judges, and other persons who have been in direct contact with the
judge being evaluated and who have direct knowledge of the judge's judicial performance during
the evaluation period.
   (b) The commission must employ or contract with qualified individuals to prepare survey forms,
process responses, and compile the statistical reports of the survey results in a manner that ensures
confidentiality and accuracy.
    (c) Each survey conducted must seek evaluations in accordance with the written performance
standards adopted as provided in paragraph (a) and must solicit narrative comments regarding the
judge's performance. Narrative comments contained in a survey response are private data on the
judge, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12. Other data on an individual who completes or
responds to a survey form are private data on that individual.
   Subd. 7. Midterm evaluation. The commission shall evaluate each judge halfway through the
judge's term, as nearly as practicable, to provide feedback to the judge about the judge's performance
and to give the judge an opportunity for improvement. The commission shall adopt procedures for
conducting the midterm evaluation.
     Subd. 8. Retention-year evaluation. (a) In each year in which a judge has the opportunity to
file as a candidate for retention, the Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission must
conduct a final evaluation of the judge and determine whether the judge meets or does not meet
judicial performance standards. Upon completion of the evaluation, the commission must rate the
judge "well-qualified," "qualified," or "unqualified" for office. A rating of "unqualified" does not
prohibit a judge from seeking retention by the voters.
   (b) The final evaluation of a judge must include a public hearing and an opportunity for
submission of written public comments on the performance of a judge standing for retention.
10072                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [94TH DAY

Before accepting public comment and conducting a hearing, the commission must notify each
judge to be evaluated of the process for conducting the evaluation and the right of the judge to
submit written comments and appear in person at the hearing. The hearing and evaluation may be
conducted by a panel of commission members, as provided in subdivision 9.
    (c) A judge who does not intend to seek retention may waive the final evaluation process by
providing written notice to the commission affirming the judge's intention to not file as a retention
candidate for the judge's current office. If a judge waives the final evaluation under this paragraph,
the judge is not eligible to file an affidavit of candidacy for the office and is not eligible to be
appointed to fill the resulting vacancy.
     Subd. 9. Evaluation panels; review by full commission. (a) The evaluation of a judge may be
conducted by an evaluation panel. An evaluation panel is composed of five members, including at
least one member appointed by each branch of government, but otherwise chosen randomly. A panel
must report its results to the full commission. The full commission shall review a panel's evaluation
if the panel rates a judge unqualified, or if one panelist or three members of the commission request
a review within 15 days after the panel makes its report. The commission may overturn a panel's
rating. If a panel's report and rating is not reviewed, the determination of the panel is final. Decisions
of an evaluation panel or the full commission regarding a judge's performance are not subject to
judicial review.
    (b) If an evaluation is reviewed by the full commission, the commission shall provide written
notice to the affected judge. The judge has the right to submit written comments to the commission
and to appear and be heard by the commission before a final vote of the commission members
regarding the judge's performance.
    Subd. 10. Publication of evaluation results. Following the final evaluation of a judge, the
commission shall compile a factual report on the judicial performance of each judge intending to
stand for retention, including the final rating assigned to the judge's performance. The report must
be made available to the public at least one month before the time period established in section
204B.09 for filing an affidavit of candidacy with the secretary of state.
   Sec. 15. [480B.03] JUDICIAL RETENTION ELECTIONS.
    Judicial retention elections must be conducted consistent with the procedures established by law
for the administration of state general elections. Judges standing for retention must be placed on the
ballot as provided in section 204D.30.
   Sec. 16. [480B.04] REQUIREMENTS FOR SERVICE ON COMMISSIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Service on multiple commissions prohibited. A person may not simultaneously
serve on more than one commission established under this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Service until appointment of successors. Members of commissions established under
this chapter continue to serve until their successors have been appointed and qualified.
   Sec. 17. [480B.05] JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; FEE.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization. The Supreme Court, through the Lawyer Registration Office,
may assess a judicial performance evaluation fee on each licensed attorney in the state. If imposed,
the fee must not exceed $15 and may only apply to attorneys actively engaged in the practice of law.

    Subd. 2. Creation of account. The Judicial Performance Evaluation Fee Account is created in
the special revenue fund. The state court administrator shall forward fees collected under subdivision
1 to the commissioner of management and budget who shall deposit them in the state treasury and
credit them to the account. The judicial performance evaluation fee collected under section 204B.11,
subdivision 3, must also be credited to the account. Money in the account is appropriated to the
Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission.
   Sec. 18. INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION COMMISSION;
FIRST MEETING; TRANSITION.
  (a) Initial appointments must be made to the Independent Judicial Performance Evaluation
Commission on July 1, 2011.
    (b) Initial appointees shall serve for a term ending January 15, 2013, and may be considered for
reappointment as provided in this article at that time. The chair of the commission must convene
the first full meeting of the commission no later than August 1, 2011, and appoint a secretary for the
commission at that first meeting.
   (c) The commission is only required to conduct a final retention-year evaluation of each judge
whose term expires on or before January 5, 2015, but may conduct an initial evaluation of these
judges to provide an opportunity for improvement if the commission determines that it is prepared
and equipped to do so. Judges whose terms expire after January 5, 2015, are subject to both the
midterm and final retention-year evaluations required by this article.
   Sec. 19. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, sections 204B.36, subdivision 5; and 204D.14, subdivision 3, are
repealed.
   Sec. 20. EFFECTIVE DATE.
