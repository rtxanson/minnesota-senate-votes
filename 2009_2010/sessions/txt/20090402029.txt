each licensed teacher. Preparation time shall be provided in one or two uninterrupted blocks during
the student day. Exceptions to this may be made by mutual agreement between the district and the

      Subdivision 1. Funeral expenses. On the death of any person receiving public assistance through
MFIP, the county agency shall attempt to contact the decedent's spouse or next of kin. If the agency
is not able to contact a spouse or next of kin, the agency shall pay for cremation of the person's
remains. If the county agency contacts the decedent's spouse or next of kin and it is determined that
cremation is not in accordance with the religious and moral beliefs of the decedent or the decedent's
spouse or the decedent's next of kin, the county agency shall pay an amount for funeral expenses
not exceeding the amount paid for comparable services under section 261.035 plus actual cemetery
charges. No cremation or funeral expenses shall be paid if the estate of the deceased is sufficient

while living, is able to pay such expenses;                       ­­­pro

determining the sufficiency of such estate, due regard shall be had for the nature and marketability
of the assets of the estate. The county agency may grant cremation or funeral expenses where the
sale would cause undue loss to the estate. Any amount paid for cremation or funeral expenses shall
be a prior claim against the estate, as provided in section 524.3-805, and any amount recovered shall
be reimbursed to the agency which paid the expenses. The commissioner shall specify requirements
for reports, including fiscal reports, according to section 256.01, subdivision 2, paragraph ­                                                    (1

      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Provider entity certification. (a) Effective July 1, 2003, the commissioner shall
establish an initial provider entity application and certification process and recertification process
to determine whether a provider entity has an administrative and clinical infrastructure that meets
the requirements in subdivisions 5 and 6. The commissioner shall recertify a provider entity at least
every three years. The commissioner shall establish a process for decertification of a provider entity
that no longer meets the requirements in this section. The county, tribe, and the commissioner shall
be mutually responsible and accountable for the county's, tribe's, and state's part of the certification,
recertification, and decertification processes.
      (b) For purposes of this section, a provider entity must be:
   (1) an Indian health services facility or a facility owned and operated by a tribe or tribal
organization operating as a 638 facility under Public Law 93-638 certified by the state;
      (2) a county-operated entity certified by the state; or

entity under this section, a provider entity must have a clinical infrastructure that utilizes diagnostic
assessment, an individualized treatment plan, service delivery, and individual treatment plan review
that are culturally competent, child-centered, and family-driven to achieve maximum benefit for the
client. The provider entity must review, and update as necessary, the clinical policies and procedures
every three years and must distribute the policies and procedures to staff initially and upon each
subsequent update.
   (b) The clinical infrastructure written policies and procedures must include policies and
procedures for:
    (1) providing or obtaining a client's diagnostic assessment that identifies acute and chronic
clinical disorders, co-occurring medical conditions, sources of psychological and environmental
problems, ­ an
             ­d­ including a functional assessment. The functional assessment component must
clearly summarize the client's individual strengths and needs;
   (2) developing an individual treatment plan that is:
   (i) based on the information in the client's diagnostic assessment;
    (ii) developed no later than the end of the first psychotherapy session after the completion
of the client's diagnostic assessment by the mental health professional who provides the client's
psychotherapy;
    (iii) developed through a child-centered, family-driven planning process that identifies service
needs and individualized, planned, and culturally appropriate interventions that contain specific
treatment goals and objectives for the client and the client's family or foster family;
   (iv) reviewed at least once every 90 days and revised, if necessary; and
    (v) signed by the client or, if appropriate, by the client's parent or other person authorized by
statute to consent to mental health services for the client;
   (3) developing an individual behavior plan that documents services to be provided by the mental
health behavioral aide. The individual behavior plan must include:
   (i) detailed instructions on the service to be provided;
   (ii) time allocated to each service;
   (iii) methods of documenting the child's behavior;
   (iv) methods of monitoring the child's progress in reaching objectives; and
   (v) goals to increase or decrease targeted behavior as identified in the individual treatment plan;
    (4) clinical supervision of the mental health practitioner and mental health behavioral aide.
A mental health professional must document the clinical supervision the professional provides
by cosigning individual treatment plans and making entries in the client's record on supervisory
activities. Clinical supervision does not include the authority to make or terminate court-ordered
placements of the child. A clinical supervisor must be available for urgent consultation as required
by the individual client's needs or the situation. Clinical supervision may occur individually or
in a small group to discuss treatment and review progress toward goals. The focus of clinical

supervision must be the client's treatment needs and progress and the mental health practitioner's
or behavioral aide's ability to provide services;
    (4a) CTSS certified provider entities providing day treatment programs must meet the conditions
in items (i) to (iii):
    (i) the supervisor must be present and available on the premises more than 50 percent of the time
in a five-working-day period during which the supervisee is providing a mental health service;
    (ii) the diagnosis and the client's individual treatment plan or a change in the diagnosis or
individual treatment plan must be made by or reviewed, approved, and signed by the supervisor;
and
   (iii) every 30 days, the supervisor must review and sign the record ­  o­

has reviewed the client's care for all activities in the preceding 30-day period;
     (4b) for all other services provided under CTSS, clinical supervision standards provided in items
(i) to (iii) must be used:
     (i) medical assistance shall reimburse a mental health practitioner who maintains a consulting
relationship with a mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility ­                                         a­

                   , the mental health professional is required to be present on site for observation as
clinically appropriate when the mental health practitioner is providing individual, family, or group
skills training to the child or the child's family; and
    (iii) when conducted, the observation must be a minimum of one clinical unit. The on-site
presence of the mental health professional must be documented in the child's record and signed by
the mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility;
     (5) providing direction to a mental health behavioral aide. For entities that employ mental health
behavioral aides, the clinical supervisor must be employed by the provider entity or other certified
children's therapeutic supports and services provider entity to ensure necessary and appropriate
oversight for the client's treatment and continuity of care. The mental health professional or mental
health practitioner giving direction must begin with the goals on the individualized treatment
plan, and instruct the mental health behavioral aide on how to construct therapeutic activities and
interventions that will lead to goal attainment. The professional or practitioner giving direction
must also instruct the mental health behavioral aide about the client's diagnosis, functional status,
and other characteristics that are likely to affect service delivery. Direction must also include
determining that the mental health behavioral aide has the skills to interact with the client and
the client's family in ways that convey personal and cultural respect and that the aide actively
solicits information relevant to treatment from the family. The aide must be able to clearly explain
the activities the aide is doing with the client and the activities' relationship to treatment goals.
Direction is more didactic than is supervision and requires the professional or practitioner providing
it to continuously evaluate the mental health behavioral aide's ability to carry out the activities of
the individualized treatment plan and the individualized behavior plan. When providing direction,
the professional or practitioner must:
     (i) review progress notes prepared by the mental health behavioral aide for accuracy and

consistency with diagnostic assessment, treatment plan, and behavior goals and the professional or
practitioner must approve and sign the progress notes;
   (ii) identify changes in treatment strategies, revise the individual behavior plan, and
communicate treatment instructions and methodologies as appropriate to ensure that treatment is
implemented correctly;
    (iii) demonstrate family-friendly behaviors that support healthy collaboration among the child,
the child's family, and providers as treatment is planned and implemented;
    (iv) ensure that the mental health behavioral aide is able to effectively communicate with the
child, the child's family, and the provider; and
  (v) record the results of any evaluation and corrective actions taken to modify the work of the
mental health behavioral aide;
   (6) providing service delivery that implements the individual treatment plan and meets the
requirements under subdivision 9; and
    (7) individual treatment plan review. The review must determine the extent to which the services
have met the goals and objectives in the previous treatment plan. The review must assess the client's
progress and ensure that services and treatment goals continue to be necessary and appropriate to
the client and the client's family or foster family. Revision of the individual treatment plan does not
require a new diagnostic assessment unless the client's mental health status has changed markedly.
The updated treatment plan must be signed by the client, if appropriate, and by the client's parent or
other person authorized by statute to give consent to the mental health services for the child.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.0943, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Service delivery criteria. (a) In delivering services under this section, a certified
provider entity must ensure that:
    (1) each individual provider's caseload size permits the provider to deliver services to both
clients with severe, complex needs and clients with less intensive needs. The provider's caseload
size should reasonably enable the provider to play an active role in service planning, monitoring,
and delivering services to meet the client's and client's family's needs, as specified in each client's
individual treatment plan;
    (2) site-based programs, including day treatment and preschool programs, provide staffing and
facilities to ensure the client's health, safety, and protection of rights, and that the programs are able
to implement each client's individual treatment plan;
    (3) a day treatment program is provided to a group of clients by a multidisciplinary team under
the clinical supervision of a mental health professional. The day treatment program must be provided
in and by: (i) an outpatient hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health
Organizations and licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.55; (ii) a community mental health center
under section 245.62; and (iii) an entity that is under contract with the county board to operate a
program that meets the requirements of sections 245.4712, subdivision 2, and 245.4884, subdivision
2, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9505.0170 to 9505.0475. The day treatment program must stabilize
the client's mental health status while developing and improving the client's independent living and
socialization skills. The goal of the day treatment program must be to reduce or relieve the effects

subdivision will only be made of federal earnings from services provided by the collaborative;
    (3) the commissioner shall review expenditures of family services collaboratives using reports
specified in the agreement with the collaborative to ensure that the base level of expenditures
is continued and new federal reimbursement is used to expand education, social, health, or
health-related services to young children and their families;
    (4) the commissioner may reduce, suspend, or eliminate a family services collaborative's
obligations to continue the base level of expenditures or expansion of services if the commissioner
determines that one or more of the following conditions apply:

   (ii) reduction in the net tax capacity of the taxable property eligible to be taxed by the lead
county or subcontractor that significantly reduces available funds for education, social, health, or
health-related services to families and children;
    (iii) reduction in the number of children under age 19 in the county, collaborative service delivery
area, subcontractor's district, or catchment area when compared to the number in the base year using
the most recent data provided by the State Demographer's Office; or
      (iv) termination of the federal revenue earned under the family services collaborative agreement;
    (5) the commissioner shall not use the federal reimbursement earned under this subdivision in
determining the allocation or distribution of other funds to counties or collaboratives;
    (6) the commissioner may suspend, reduce, or terminate the federal reimbursement to a provider
that does not meet the reporting or other requirements of this subdivision;
    (7) the commissioner shall recover from the family services collaborative any federal fiscal
disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions directly attributable to the family services
collaborative's actions in the integrated fund, or the proportional share if federal fiscal disallowances
or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample; and
   (8) the commissioner shall establish criteria for the family services collaborative for the
accounting and financial management system that will support claims for federal reimbursement.
   (b) The family services collaborative shall have the following authority and responsibilities
regarding federal revenue enhancement:
    (1) the family services collaborative shall be the party with which the commissioner contracts. A
lead county shall be designated as the fiscal agency for reporting, claiming, and receiving payments;
    (2) the family services collaboratives may enter into subcontracts with other counties, school
districts, special education cooperatives, municipalities, and other public and nonprofit entities for
purposes of identifying and claiming eligible expenditures to enhance federal reimbursement, or to

   (1) require that, as a condition of licensure, foster care providers attend training on understanding
and validating the cultural heritage of all children in their care, and on the importance of the Indian
Child Welfare Act, United States Code, title 25, sections 1901 to 1923, and the Minnesota Indian
Family Preservation Act, sections 260.751 to 260.835; ­     an­­

    (2) review and, where necessary, revise foster care rules to reflect sensitivity to cultural
diversity and differing lifestyles. Specifically, the commissioner shall examine whether space and
other requirements discriminate against single-parent, minority, or low-income families who may
be able to provide quality foster care reflecting the values of their own respective cultures; and
    (3) relieve relative foster care providers of the requirements promulgated as a result of clauses
(1) and (2) when the safety of the child is not jeopardized and as allowed under federal law.

contracted for any prepaid funeral arrangements. If prepaid arrangements have been made, the
county shall authorize arrangements to be implemented in accord with the instructions of the
deceased. If it is determined that the person did not leave sufficient means to defray the necessary
expenses of a funeral and final disposition, nor any spouse of sufficient ability to procure the burial,

    Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 62Q.37, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Audits. (a) The commissioner may conduct routine audits and investigations as
prescribed under the commissioner's respective state authorizing statutes. If a nationally recognized
independent organization has conducted an audit of the health plan company using audit procedures
that are comparable to or more stringent than the commissioner's audit procedures:
    (1) the commissioner m ­­­ shall accept the independent audit and require no further audit if the
                            ay
results of the independent audit show that the performance standard being audited meets or exceeds
state standards;
    (2) the commissioner may accept the independent audit and limit further auditing if the results
of the independent audit show that the performance standard being audited partially meets state
standards;
    (3) the health plan company must demonstrate to the commissioner that the nationally
recognized independent organization that conducted the audit is qualified and that the results of the
audit demonstrate that the particular performance standard partially or fully meets state standards;
and
    (4) if the commissioner has partially or fully accepted an independent audit of the performance
standard, the commissioner may use the finding of a deficiency with regard to statutes or rules by
an independent audit as the basis for a targeted audit or enforcement action.
    (b) If a health plan company has formally delegated activities that are required under either
state law or contract to another organization that has undergone an audit by a nationally recognized
independent organization, that health plan company may use the nationally recognized accrediting
body's determination on its own behalf under this section.

     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 471.61, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Officers, employees. A county, municipal corporation, town, school district,
county extension committee, other political subdivision or other body corporate and politic of this
state, other than the state or any department of the state, through its governing body, and any two
or more subdivisions acting jointly through their governing bodies, may insure or protect its or
their officers and employees, and their dependents, or any class or classes of officers, employees,
or dependents, under a policy or policies or contract or contracts of group insurance or benefits
covering life, health, and accident, in the case of employees, and medical and surgical benefits
and hospitalization insurance or benefits for both employees and dependents or dependents of an
employee whose death was due to causes arising out of and in the course of employment, or any one
or more of those forms of insurance or protection. A governmental unit, including county extension
committees and those paying their employees, may pay all or any part of the premiums or charges on
the insurance or protection. A payment is deemed to be additional compensation paid to the officers
or employees, but for purposes of determining contributions or benefits under a public pension
or retirement system it is not deemed to be additional compensation. One or more governmental
units may determine that a person is an officer or employee if the person receives income from the
governmental subdivisions without regard to the manner of election or appointment, including but
not limited to employees of county historical societies that receive funding from the county and
employees of the Minnesota Inter-county Association. The appropriate officer of the governmental

unit, or those disbursing county extension funds, shall deduct from the salary or wages of each
officer and employee who elects to become insured or so protected, on the officer's or employee's
written order, all or part of the officer's or employee's share of premiums or charges and remit the
share or portion to the insurer or company issuing the policy or contract.
    A governmental unit, other than a school district, that pays all or part of the premiums or charges
is authorized to levy and collect a tax, if necessary, in the next annual tax levy for the purpose of
providing the necessary money for the payment of the premiums or charges, and the sums levied
and appropriated are not, in the event the sum exceeds the maximum sum allowed by the charter
of a municipal corporation, considered part of the cost of government of the governmental unit as
defined in any levy or expenditure limitation; provided at least 50 percent of the cost of benefits on
dependents must be contributed by the employee or be paid by levies within existing charter tax
limitations.
   The word "dependents" as used in this subdivision means spouse and minor unmarried children
under the age of 18 years actually dependent upon the employee.
    Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a political subdivision described in this
subdivision may provide health benefits to its employees, dependents, and other eligible persons
through negotiated contributions to self-funded multiemployer health and welfare funds.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment; applies to

shall be made by the commissioner of corrections. The officer conducting the presentence or
predispositional investigation shall make reasonable and good faith efforts to contact and provide
the victim with the information required under section 611A.037, subdivision 2. Presentence

Fire Marshal; firefighters, regardless of whether the firefighters receive any remuneration for
providing services; peace officers, as defined in section 626.05, subdivision 2; individuals providing
emergency management services; and individuals providing emergency medical services.
    (c) When the crime is a felony violation of chapter 152 involving the sale or distribution of a
controlled substance, the report ­

the defendant's rehabilitation and recommendations as to the sentence which should be imposed. In
misdemeanor cases the report may be oral.
    (e) When a defendant has been convicted of a felony, and before sentencing, the court shall cause
a sentencing worksheet to be completed to facilitate the application of the Minnesota Sentencing
Guidelines. The worksheet shall be submitted as part of the presentence investigation report.
    (f) When a person is convicted of a felony for which the Sentencing Guidelines presume that the
defendant will be committed to the commissioner of corrections under an executed sentence and no
motion for a sentencing departure has been made by counsel, the court may, when there is no space
available in the local correctional facility, commit the defendant to the custody of the commissioner
of corrections, pending completion of the presentence investigation and report. When a defendant
is convicted of a felony for which the Sentencing Guidelines do not presume that the defendant
will be committed to the commissioner of corrections, or for which the Sentencing Guidelines
presume commitment to the commissioner but counsel has moved for a sentencing departure, the
court may commit the defendant to the commissioner with the consent of the commissioner, pending
completion of the presentence investigation and report. The county of commitment shall return the
defendant to the court when the court so orders.

town, county, or home rule charter or statutory city.
    Subd. 2. Effective dates. If the agency determines that the proposed rule requires adoption or
amendment of an ordinance or other regulation, or if the administrative law judge disapproves the
agency's determination that the rule does not have this effect, the rule may not become effective
until:
      (1) the next July 1 or January 1 after notice of final adoption is published in the State Register;
or
      (2) a later date provided by law or specified in the proposed rule.
      Subd. 3. Exceptions. Subdivision 2 does not apply:
    (1) to a rule adopted under section 14.388, 14.389, or 14.3895, or under another law specifying
that the rulemaking procedures of this chapter do not apply;
    (2) if the administrative law judge approves an agency's determination that the rule has been
proposed pursuant to a specific federal statutory or regulatory mandate that requires the rule to take
effect before the date specified in subdivision 1; or
      (3) if the governor waives application of subdivision 2.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 168.33, subdivision 7, is amended to read:

of an error made by the Department of Public Safety, a dealer, or a deputy registrar. The filing fee
must be shown as a separate item on all registration renewal notices sent out by the commissioner.
No filing fee or other fee may be charged for the permanent surrender of a title for a vehicle.
    (b) The fees imposed under paragraph (a) may be paid by credit card or debit card. The deputy
registrar may collect a surcharge on the fee not to exceed the cost of processing a credit card or debit
card transaction, in accordance with emergency rules established by the commissioner of public
safety.
      (c) All of the fees collected under paragraph (a), clause (1), by the department, must be paid into

    Subd. 2. Cost of proceedings; other ballot questions. The costs of complaints relating to a
ballot question other than a statewide ballot question or an election other than an election for a
statewide or legislative office must be paid by the parties in the proportions that they agree to.
Notwithstanding section 14.53 or other law, the Office of Administrative Hearings is not liable for
the costs. If the parties do not agree to a division of the costs before the commencement of mediation,
arbitration, or hearing, the costs must be allocated on an equitable basis by the mediator, arbitrator,
or chief administrative law judge. The chief administrative law judge may contract with the parties
to a matter for the purpose of providing administrative law judges and reporters for an administrative
proceeding or alternative dispute resolution. The chief administrative law judge shall assess the cost
of services rendered by the Office of Administrative Hearings as provided by section 14.53.
     Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 306.243, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

      382.265 CLERK HIRE IN CERTAIN COUNTIES.
      In all counties of this state where the amount of clerk hire now or hereafter provided by law for
any county office shall be insufficient to meet the requirements of said office, the county officer in
need of additional clerk hire shall prepare a petition and statement setting forth therein the amount
of additional clerk hire needed and file the same with the county auditor, who shall present the
same to the board of county commissioners at the next meeting of said board. If the board of county
commissioners shall grant said petition by majority vote of all members elected to the board, then the
amount of additional clerk hire requested in said petition shall thereupon become effective for said
office. Said board shall act on any such petition within 60 days from the time it has been filed with the
county auditor. If the board of county commissioners shall determine that the amount of additional
clerk hire requested in said petition is excessive and more than is necessary for said office, it shall
fix the amount of such additional clerk hire to be allowed, if any, and notify such officer thereof. ­                                                             I­f

set of plans and specifications or a single contract.

of the federal financial assistance; and
    (iii) for which the contract provides for the construction of the project upon land that is either

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
      (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
      (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. ­                                                         In

property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
    (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
    (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for Minneapolis
Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St. Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under
section 134.07 may be listed separately from the remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case
of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F
applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity
subject to the areawide tax must each be stated separately and not included in the sum of the special
taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
    (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
    (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;

    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

in the following year, at a public hearing, if a public hearing is required under subdivision 6. The
notice must be published not less than two business days nor more than six business days before the
hearing.
    The advertisement must be at least one-eighth page in size of a standard-size or a tabloid-size
newspaper. The advertisement must not be placed in the part of the newspaper where legal notices
and classified advertisements appear. The advertisement must be published in an official newspaper
of general circulation in the taxing authority. The newspaper selected must be one of general interest

appear in a newspaper that is published at least once per week.
    For purposes of this section, the metropolitan special taxing district's advertisement must only
be published in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press.
    In addition to other requirements, a county and a city having a population of more than 2,500
must show in the public advertisement required under this subdivision the current local tax rate,
the proposed local tax rate if no property tax levy increase is adopted, and the proposed rate if
the proposed levy is adopted. For purposes of this subdivision, "local tax rate" means the city's or
county's net tax capacity levy divided by the city's or county's taxable net tax capacity.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (g), the advertisement for school districts, metropolitan
special taxing districts, and regional library districts must be in the following form, except that
the notice for a school district may include references to the current budget in regard to proposed

such county auditor shall extend only such amount of taxes as the limitations herein prescribed will
permit; provided, if such levy shall include any levy for the payment of bonded indebtedness or
judgments, such levies for bonded indebtedness or judgments shall be extended in full, and the
remainder of the levies shall be reduced so that the total thereof, including levies for bonds and
judgments, shall not exceed such amount as the limitations herein prescribed will permit.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.62, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Report on taxes levied. The commissioner of revenue shall establish procedures
for the annual reporting of local government levies. Each local governmental unit shall submit a
report to the commissioner by December 30 of the year in which the tax is levied. The report shall
include, but is not limited to, information on the amount of the tax levied by the governmental unit
for the following purposes:
   (1) social services and related programs, which include taxes levied for the purposes defined in
Minnesota Statutes 1991 Supplement, section 275.50, subdivision 5, clauses (a), (j), and (v);
   (2) the amounts levied for each of the purposes listed in Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 275.70,
subdivision 5; and
    (3) other levies, which include the taxes levied for all purposes not included in clause (1), (2),
or (3).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 279.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Due dates; penalties. Except as provided in subdivision 3 or 4, on May 16 or
21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is
later, a penalty accrues and thereafter is charged upon all unpaid taxes on real estate on the current
lists in the hands of the county treasurer. The penalty is at a rate of two percent on homestead
property until May 31 and four percent on June 1. The penalty on nonhomestead property is at a
rate of four percent until May 31 and eight percent on June 1. This penalty does not accrue until
June 1 of each year, or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing the property
tax statements, whichever is later, on commercial use real property used for seasonal residential
recreational purposes and classified as class 1c or 4c, and on other commercial use real property
classified as class 3a, provided that over 60 percent of the gross income earned by the enterprise on
the class 3a property is earned during the months of May, June, July, and August. In order for the first
half of the tax due on class 3a property to be paid after May 15 and before June 1, or 21 days after
the postmark date on the envelope containing the property tax statement, whichever is later, without
penalty, the owner of the property must attach an affidavit to the payment attesting to compliance
with the income provision of this subdivision. Thereafter, for both homestead and nonhomestead
property, on the first day of each month beginning July 1, up to and including October 1 following,
an additional penalty of one percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes
provided that if the due date was extended beyond May 15 as the result of any delay in mailing
property tax statements no additional penalty shall accrue if the tax is paid by the extended due

date. If the tax is not paid by the extended due date, then all penalties that would have accrued if the
due date had been May 15 shall be charged. When the taxes against any tract or lot exceed $  ­­50
                                                                                                ­ $250,
one-half thereof may be paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope
containing the property tax statement, whichever is later; and, if so paid, no penalty attaches; the
remaining one-half may be paid at any time prior to October 16 following, without penalty; but,
if not so paid, then a penalty of two percent accrues thereon for homestead property and a penalty
of four percent on nonhomestead property. Thereafter, for homestead property, on the first day of
November an additional penalty of four percent accrues and on the first day of December following,
an additional penalty of two percent accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. Thereafter,
for nonhomestead property, on the first day of November and December following, an additional
penalty of four percent for each month accrues and is charged on all such unpaid taxes. If one-half of
such taxes are not paid prior to May 16 or 21 days after the postmark date on the envelope containing
the property tax statement, whichever is later, the same may be paid at any time prior to October
16, with accrued penalties to the date of payment added, and thereupon no penalty attaches to the
remaining one-half until October 16 following.
    This section applies to payment of personal property taxes assessed against improvements to
leased property, except as provided by section 277.01, subdivision 3.
    A county may provide by resolution that in the case of a property owner that has multiple tracts
or parcels with aggregate taxes exceeding ­$5­­
                                              0 $250, payments may be made in installments as
provided in this subdivision.
     The county treasurer may accept payments of more or less than the exact amount of a tax
installment due. Payments must be applied first to the oldest installment that is due but which
has not been fully paid. If the accepted payment is less than the amount due, payments must be
applied first to the penalty accrued for the year or the installment being paid. Acceptance of partial
payment of tax does not constitute a waiver of the minimum payment required as a condition for
filing an appeal under section 278.03 or any other law, nor does it affect the order of payment of
delinquent taxes under section 280.39.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.

    Subd. 8. Tax levy for repayment. (a) With the approval of the authority, a governmental unit
may levy in the year the state makes a payment under this section an amount up to the amount
necessary to provide funds for the repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through
the date of estimated repayment by the governmental unit. The proceeds of this levy may be used
only for this purpose unless they exceed the amount actually due. Any excess must be used to repay
other state payments made under this section or must be deposited in the debt redemption fund of
the governmental unit. The amount of aids to be reduced to repay the state are decreased by the
amount levied.
    (b) If the state is not repaid in full for a payment made under this section by November 30
of the calendar year following the year in which the state makes the payment, the authority shall
require the governmental unit to certify a property tax levy in an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the governmental unit. To prevent undue hardship, the authority may allow
the governmental unit to certify the levy over a five-year period. The proceeds of the levy may be

excess must be used to repay other state payments made under this section or must be deposited in
the debt redemption fund of the governmental unit. If the authority orders the governmental unit to
levy, the amount of aids reduced to repay the state are decreased by the amount levied.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2010 and thereafter.
     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 465.719, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Application of other laws. A corporation created by a political subdivision under this
section must comply with every law that applies to the political subdivision, as if the corporation
is a part of the political subdivision, unless the resolution ratifying creation of the corporation
specifically exempts the corporation from part or all of a law. If the resolution exempts the
corporation from part or all of a law, the resolution must make a detailed and specific finding as to
why the corporation cannot fulfill its purpose if the corporation is subject to that law. A corporation
may not be exempted from chapter 13D, the Minnesota Open Meeting Law, sections 138.163 to
138.25, governing records management, or chapter 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices
Act. Any affected or interested person may bring an action in district court to void the resolution
on the grounds that the findings are not sufficiently detailed and specific, or that the corporation
can fulfill its purpose if it is subject to the law from which the resolution exempts the corporation.
Laws that apply to a political subdivision that also apply to a corporation created by a political
subdivision under this subdivision include, but are not limited to:
     (1) chapter 13D, the Minnesota Open Meeting Law;
     (2) chapter 13, the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act;
     (3) section 471.345, the Uniform Municipal Contracting Law;
   (4) sections 43A.17, limiting the compensation of employees based on the governor's salary;
471.991 to 471.999, providing for equitable pay; and 465.72 and 465.722, governing severance
pay;

      237.626 PROMOTION ACTIVITIES.
      Subdivision 1. Promotions. A telephone company or telecommunications carrier may promote
the use of its services by offering a waiver of part or all of a recurring or a nonrecurring charge,
a redemption coupon, or a premium with the purchase of a service. Section 237.09 does not apply
to promotions under this section, but the customer group to which the promotion is available must
be based on reasonable distinctions among customers. N                                               ­o ­­­ s­n

the first day for early voting.
   Sec. 13. [203B.35] PROCEDURES FOR EARLY VOTING.
     Subdivision 1. Voting procedure. Each voter shall sign an early voting roster that must include
the certification provided in section 204C.10. An individual who is not registered to vote must
register in the manner provided in section 201.061, subdivision 3. After the voter has signed a roster,
two staff of the county auditor or municipal clerk or two election judges must initial the appropriate
ballot for the voter's precinct and provide it to the voter. The voter must mark the ballot and deposit
it in either a precinct voting system or a sealed ballot box. A voter may not leave the polling place
with the ballot.
    Subd. 2. Record of voting. (a) The county auditor or municipal clerk must immediately record
that a voter has voted early on the voter's record in the statewide voter registration system. After
a voter's record has been marked to record that an individual has voted early, the individual must
not be allowed to vote again at that election. Voters who are not preregistered at the voter's current
address must be considered election day registrants.
    (b) The early voting rosters must be marked no later than the start of voting on election day to
indicate the voters who have cast a ballot at an early voting location. The rosters may be marked
either:
   (1) by the municipal clerk before election day;
   (2) by the absentee ballot board before election day; or
   (3) by the election judges at the polling place on election day.
    (c) A voter who has cast a ballot in person by early voting and deposited it in a ballot box or
ballot counter must not be permitted to vote at the polling place on election day. An absentee ballot
received from a voter who has cast a ballot in person by early voting must be rejected by the election
judges.
   Subd. 3. Storage and counting of ballots. Two staff of the county auditor or municipal clerk or
two election judges of different major political parties must:
   (1) remove the ballots from the ballot box and seal and secure them at the end of each day on
which early ballots were inserted into the ballot box; and
    (2) without inspecting the ballots, ensure that the number of ballots removed from the ballot box
is equal to the number of voters who voted early.
    After the polls have closed on election day, two staff of the county auditor or two election judges
of different major political parties must count the early ballots, tabulating the vote in a manner that
indicates each vote of the voter and the total votes cast for each candidate or question. In state
primary and state general elections, the results must indicate the total votes cast for each candidate
or question in each precinct and report the vote totals tabulated for each precinct. The count shall be

is at least 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, has resided in Minnesota for 20 days
immediately preceding the election, maintains residence at the address shown, is not under a
guardianship in which the court order revokes the individual's right to vote, has not been found by a
court of law to be legally incompetent to vote or has the right to vote because, if the individual was
convicted of a felony, the felony sentence has expired or been completed or the individual has been
discharged from the sentence, is registered and has not already voted in the election. The roster
must also state: "I understand that deliberately providing false information is a felony punishable
by not more than five years imprisonment and a fine of not more than $10,000, or both."
    (b) An individual voting early under section 203B.30 must sign a roster that meets the additional
requirements of this paragraph. In addition to the content required under paragraph (a), the roster
must also state: "I understand that after I have cast my ballot today, I cannot vote again in this
election."
   (c) All of the text contained within the quotation marks in paragraphs (a) and (b) must be in bold
type in rosters provided to individuals voting under section 203B.30.
    (d) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster, confirm the applicant's name, address, and
date of birth.
    ­
    (­) (e) After the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the applicant a voter's receipt.
     c­
The voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's
right to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be
maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest.

system tested to ascertain that the system will correctly mark ballots using all methods supported by
the system, including through assistive technology, and count the votes cast for all candidates and on
all questions. Public notice of the time and place of the test must be given at least two days in advance
by publication once in official newspapers. The test must be observed by at least two election
judges, who are not of the same major political party, and must be open to representatives of the
political parties, candidates, the press, and the public. The test must be conducted by (1) processing
a preaudited group of ballots punched or marked to record a predetermined number of valid votes
for each candidate and on each question, and must include for each office one or more ballot cards
which have votes in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the voting
system tabulator and electronic ballot marker to reject those votes; and (2) processing an additional
test deck of ballots marked using the electronic ballot marker for the precinct, including ballots
marked using the electronic ballot display, audio ballot reader, and any assistive voting technology
used with the electronic ballot marker. If any error is detected, the cause must be ascertained and

corrected and an errorless count must be made before the voting system may be used in the election.
After the completion of the test, the programs used and ballot cards must be sealed, retained, and
disposed of as provided for paper ballots.
   Testing of equipment used for early voting must be conducted as soon as practicable after the
equipment has been programmed. Testing of equipment used on the day of the election must be
conducted within the 14 days before election day.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 206.89, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Selection for review; notice. At the canvass of the state primary, the county canvassing
board in each county must set the date, time, and place for the postelection review of the state general
election to be held under this section.
    At the canvass of the state general election, the county canvassing boards must select the
precincts to be reviewed by lot. The early ballots counted centrally must be considered a precinct
eligible to be selected for the purposes of this subdivision. The county canvassing board of a
county with fewer than 50,000 registered voters must conduct a postelection review of a total of at
least two precincts. The county canvassing board of a county with between 50,000 and 100,000
registered voters must conduct a review of a total of at least three precincts. The county canvassing
board of a county with over 100,000 registered voters must conduct a review of a total of at least
four precincts, or three percent of the total number of precincts in the county, whichever is greater.
At least one precinct selected in each county must have had more than 150 votes cast at the general
election.
    The county auditor must notify the secretary of state of the precincts that have been chosen for
review and the time and place the postelection review for that county will be conducted, as soon as
the decisions are made. If the selection of precincts has not resulted in the selection of at least four
precincts in each congressional district, the secretary of state may require counties to select by lot
additional precincts to meet the congressional district requirement. The secretary of state must post
this information on the office Web site.
   Sec. 17. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 203B.11, subdivision 2, is repealed.
   Sec. 18. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Sections 1 to 17 are effective when the secretary of state has certified that:
    (1) the statewide voter registration system has been tested, shown to properly allow for the
tracking of the information required to conduct early voting, and can handle the expected volume
of use; and
    (2) that voting equipment that can tabulate at least 30 different ballot styles has been certified
for use in this state.
Upon certification, sections 1 to 6 apply to all federal, state, county, and city elections held in
conjunction with the state primary in 2010 and thereafter, and to all other elections held in 2014 and
thereafter. A municipality may implement the requirements of this chapter prior to the date provided
in this paragraph, if the secretary of state has made the certification required by this section at least

    (d) A peace officer who issues an administrative citation for the infraction of speeding under

and nonhomestead residential real estate and seasonal residential real estate occupied for
recreational purposes. Except as otherwise provided by law, a nonconformity, including the lawful
use or occupation of land or premises existing at the time of the adoption of an official control under
this chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement, restoration, maintenance, or
improvement, but not including expansion. If the nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for
a period of more than one year, or any nonconforming building or structure is destroyed by fire or
other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value, as indicated in the
records of the county assessor at the time of damage, and no building permit has been applied for
within 180 days of when the property is damaged, any subsequent use or occupancy of the land
or premises must be a conforming use or occupancy. If a nonconforming building or structure is
destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value,
as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time of damage, the board may impose
reasonable conditions upon a zoning or building permit in order to mitigate any newly created
impact on adjacent property or water body. When a nonconforming structure in the shoreland
district with less than 50 percent of the required setback from the water is destroyed by fire or other
peril to greater than 50 percent of its estimated market value, as indicated in the records of the

controls that do not meet the requirements for lot size or lot width. A county shall regulate the use of
nonconforming lots of record and the repair, replacement, maintenance, improvement, or expansion
of nonconforming uses and structures in shoreland areas according to this subdivision.
    (b) A nonconforming single lot of record located within a shoreland area may be allowed as a
building site without variances from lot size requirements, provided that:
   (1) all structure and septic system setback distance requirements can be met;
    (2) a Type 1 sewage treatment system consistent with Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, can be
installed or the lot is connected to a public sewer; and

lot must be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purpose of sale or development, if it meets
the following requirements:
    (1) the lot must be at least 66 percent of the dimensional standard for lot width and lot size for
the shoreland classification consistent with Minnesota Rules, chapter 6120;

combined with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more conforming lots as much
as possible.

under a common ownership must be able to be sold or purchased individually if each lot contained
a habitable residential dwelling at the time the lots came under common ownership and the lots are
suitable for, or served by, a sewage treatment system consistent with the requirements of section
115.55 and Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, or connected to a public sewer.
    (f) In evaluating all variances, zoning and building permit applications, or conditional use
requests, the zoning authority shall require the property owner to address, when appropriate,
storm water runoff management, reducing impervious surfaces, increasing setback, restoration
of wetlands, vegetative buffers, sewage treatment and water supply capabilities, and other
conservation-designed actions.
    (g) A portion of a conforming lot may be separated from an existing parcel as long as the
remainder of the existing parcel meets the lot size and sewage system requirements of the zoning
district for a new lot and the newly created parcel is combined with an adjacent parcel.

    Subd. 1e. Nonconformities. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, any nonconformity,
including the lawful use or occupation of land or premises existing at the time of the adoption of
an additional control under this chapter, may be continued, including through repair, replacement,
restoration, maintenance, or improvement, but not including expansion, unless:
   (1) the nonconformity or occupancy is discontinued for a period of more than one year; or
    (2) any nonconforming use is destroyed by fire or other peril to the extent of greater than 50
percent of its estimated market value, as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time
of damage, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when the property is
damaged. In this case, a municipality may impose reasonable conditions upon a zoning or building
permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property or water body. When a
nonconforming structure in the shoreland district with less than 50 percent of the required setback
from the water is destroyed by fire or other peril to greater than 50 percent of its estimated market
value, as indicated in the records of the county assessor at the time of damage, the structure setback
must be increased if practicable and reasonable conditions may be placed upon a zoning or building
permit to mitigate created impacts on the adjacent property or water body.
    (b) Any subsequent use or occupancy of the land or premises shall be a conforming use or
occupancy. A municipality may, by ordinance, permit an expansion or impose upon nonconformities
reasonable regulations to prevent and abate nuisances and to protect the public health, welfare, or
safety. This subdivision does not prohibit a municipality from enforcing an ordinance that applies
to adults-only bookstores, adults-only theaters, or similar adults-only businesses, as defined by
ordinance.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a municipality shall regulate the repair, replacement,
maintenance, improvement, or expansion of nonconforming uses and structures in floodplain areas
to the extent necessary to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and not
increase flood damage potential or increase the degree of obstruction to flood flows in the floodway.
    (d) Paragraphs (d) to (j) apply to shoreland lots of record in the office of the county recorder
on the date of adoption of local shoreland controls that do not meet the requirements for lot size
or lot width. A municipality shall regulate the use of nonconforming lots of record and the repair,
replacement, maintenance, improvement, or expansion of nonconforming uses and structures in
shoreland areas according to paragraphs (d) to (j).
    (e) A nonconforming single lot of record located within a shoreland area may be allowed as a
building site without variances from lot size requirements, provided that:
   (1) all structure and septic system setback distance requirements can be met;
    (2) a Type 1 sewage treatment system consistent with Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, can be
installed or the lot is connected to a public sewer; and
   (3) the impervious surface coverage does not exceed 25 percent of the lot.
    (f) In a group of two or more contiguous lots of record under a common ownership, an individual
lot must be considered as a separate parcel of land for the purpose of sale or development, if it meets
the following requirements:
   (1) the lot must be at least 66 percent of the dimensional standard for lot width and lot size for

the shoreland classification consistent with Minnesota Rules, chapter 6120;
    (2) the lot must be connected to a public sewer, if available, or must be suitable for the installation
of a Type 1 sewage treatment system consistent with Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, and local
government controls;
   (3) impervious surface coverage must not exceed 25 percent of each lot; and
   (4) development of the lot must be consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan.
   (g) A lot subject to paragraph (f) not meeting the requirements of paragraph (f) must be combined
with the one or more contiguous lots so they equal one or more conforming lots as much as possible.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraph (f), contiguous nonconforming lots of record in shoreland areas
under a common ownership must be able to be sold or purchased individually if each lot contained
a habitable residential dwelling at the time the lots came under common ownership and the lots are
suitable for, or served by, a sewage treatment system consistent with the requirements of section
115.55 and Minnesota Rules, chapter 7080, or connected to a public sewer.
    (i) In evaluating all variances, zoning and building permit applications, or conditional use
requests, the zoning authority shall require the property owner to address, when appropriate,
storm water runoff management, reducing impervious surfaces, increasing setback, restoration
of wetlands, vegetative buffers, sewage treatment and water supply capabilities, and other
conservation-designed actions.
    (j) A portion of a conforming lot may be separated from an existing parcel as long as the
remainder of the existing parcel meets the lot size and sewage treatment requirements of the zoning
district for a new lot and the newly created parcel is combined with an adjacent parcel.

   Subd. 1b. Address and telephone number. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d), an affidavit
of candidacy must state the candidate's residence address and a telephone number where the
candidate can be contacted. The form for the affidavit of candidacy and for the separate affidavit
required under paragraph (c) must allow the candidate to specify that the candidate's address must
be classified as private data.
     (b) For an office whose residency requirement must be satisfied by the close of the filing period,
a registered voter in this state may request in writing that the filing officer receiving the affidavit of
candidacy review the address as provided in this paragraph, at any time up to one day after the last
day for filing for office. If requested, the filing officer must determine whether the address provided
in the affidavit of candidacy is within the area represented by the office the candidate is seeking.
If the filing officer determines that the address is not within the area represented by the office, the
filing officer must immediately notify the candidate and the candidate's name must be removed from
the ballot for that office. A determination made by a filing officer under this paragraph is subject to
judicial review under section 204B.44.
    (c) For an office whose residency requirement may be satisfied as of a date after filings close, a
candidate who does not reside in the district at the time of filing must submit a separate affidavit
stating the candidate's residence address and a telephone number where the candidate can be
contacted. The affidavit must be submitted to the filing officer by the deadline for meeting the
residency requirement.
    (d) If the candidate specifies pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision that the candidate's
residence address is to be classified as private data, the candidate shall instead list the residence
address on a separate sheet to be attached to the affidavit of candidacy and that may be reviewed by
the filing officer as provided in this subdivision, but the residence address is otherwise classified as
private data.
    (e) The requirements of this subdivision do not apply to affidavits of candidacy for a candidate

conducted, they must be done electronically using the standards described in this section. Nothing
in this section requires providers, group purchasers, prescribers, or dispensers to electronically
conduct transactions that are expressly prohibited by other sections or federal law.
    (c) Providers, group purchasers, prescribers, and dispensers must use either HL7 messages
or the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard to transmit prescriptions or prescription-related information
internally when the sender and the recipient are part of the same legal entity. If an entity sends
prescriptions outside the entity, it must use the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard or other applicable
standards required by this section. Any pharmacy within an entity must be able to receive electronic
prescription transmittals from outside the entity using the adopted NCPDP SCRIPT Standard. This
exemption does not supersede any Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
requirement that may require the use of a HIPAA transaction standard within an organization.

providers of adult foster care services, the commissioner may issue an adult foster care license
with a capacity of five adults if the fifth bed does not increase the overall statewide capacity of
licensed adult foster care beds in homes that are not the primary residence of the license holder,
over the licensed capacity in such homes on July 1, 2009, as identified in a plan submitted to the
commissioner by the county, when the capacity is recommended by the county licensing agency of

    (1) the facility meets the physical environment requirements in the adult foster care licensing
rule;
   (2) the five-bed living arrangement is specified for each resident in the resident's:
   (i) individualized plan of care;
   (ii) individual service plan under section 256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required; or
    (iii) individual resident placement agreement under Minnesota Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart

resident's legal representative documenting the resident's informed choice to living in the home

license holder continues to comply with the requirements in paragraph (d).
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Revised per diem based on legislated rate reduction. Notwithstanding section
252.28, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), if the 2009 legislature adopts a rate reduction that impacts
payment to providers of adult foster care services, the commissioner may issue adult foster care
licenses that permit a capacity of five adults. The application for a five-bed license must meet
the requirements of section 245A.11, subdivision 2a. Prior to admission of the fifth recipient of
adult foster care services, the county must negotiate a revised per diem rate for room and board
and waiver services that reflects the legislated rate reduction and results in an overall average per
diem reduction for all foster care recipients in that home. The revised per diem must allow the
provider to maintain, as much as possible, the level of services or enhanced services provided in
the residence, while mitigating the losses of the legislated rate reduction.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.49, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17. Cost of services and supports. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that the average
per capita expenditures estimated in any fiscal year for home and community-based waiver
recipients does not exceed the average per capita expenditures that would have been made to
provide institutional services for recipients in the absence of the waiver.
    (b) The commissioner shall implement on January 1, 2002, one or more aggregate, need-based
methods for allocating to local agencies the home and community-based waivered service resources
available to support recipients with disabilities in need of the level of care provided in a nursing
facility or a hospital. The commissioner shall allocate resources to single counties and county
partnerships in a manner that reflects consideration of:
   (1) an incentive-based payment process for achieving outcomes;
   (2) the need for a state-level risk pool;
1448                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [29TH DAY

   (3) the need for retention of management responsibility at the state agency level; and
   (4) a phase-in strategy as appropriate.
    (c) Until the allocation methods described in paragraph (b) are implemented, the annual
allowable reimbursement level of home and community-based waiver services shall be the greater
of:
    (1) the statewide average payment amount which the recipient is assigned under the waiver
reimbursement system in place on June 30, 2001, modified by the percentage of any provider rate
increase appropriated for home and community-based services; or
    (2) an amount approved by the commissioner based on the recipient's extraordinary needs that
cannot be met within the current allowable reimbursement level. The increased reimbursement level
must be necessary to allow the recipient to be discharged from an institution or to prevent imminent
placement in an institution. The additional reimbursement may be used to secure environmental
modifications; assistive technology and equipment; and increased costs for supervision, training,
and support services necessary to address the recipient's extraordinary needs. The commissioner
may approve an increased reimbursement level for up to one year of the recipient's relocation from
an institution or up to six months of a determination that a current waiver recipient is at imminent
risk of being placed in an institution.
    (d) Beginning July 1, 2001, medically necessary private duty nursing services will be authorized
under this section as complex and regular care according to sections 256B.0651 and 256B.0653 to
256B.0656. The rate established by the commissioner for registered nurse or licensed practical nurse
services under any home and community-based waiver as of January 1, 2001, shall not be reduced.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 252.28, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), if the 2009 legislature adopts a
rate reduction that impacts payment to providers of adult foster care services, the commissioner may
issue adult foster care licenses that permit a capacity of five adults. The application for a five-bed
license must meet the requirements of section 245A.11, subdivision 2a. Prior to admission of the fifth
recipient of adult foster care services, the county must negotiate a revised per diem rate for room and
board and waiver services that reflects the legislated rate reduction and results in an overall average
per diem reduction for all foster care recipients in that home. The revised per diem must allow the
provider to maintain, as much as possible, the level of services or enhanced services provided in the
residence, while mitigating the losses of the legislated rate reduction.
   Sec. 4. WAIVER.
    By December 1, 2009, the commissioner shall request all federal approvals and waiver
amendments to the disability home and community-based waivers to allow properly licensed adult
foster care homes to provide residential services for up to five individuals.
   Sec. 5. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 256B.092, subdivision 5a, is repealed.

    (a) Prior to collecting a sample, persons with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1
must provide parents or legal guardians of infants with a document that provides the following
information:
    (1) the blood sample will be used to test for heritable and congenital disorders, the blood sample
will be retained by the Department of Health for a period of at least two years and that the blood
sample may be used for public health studies and research;
      (2) the data that will be collected as a result of the testing;
    (3) the alternatives available to the parents set forth in paragraph (b) and that a form to exercise
the alternatives is available from the person with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1;
   (4) the benefits of testing and the consequences of a decision to permit or refuse to supply a
sample;
    (5) the benefits of retaining the blood sample and the consequences of a decision to destroy the
blood sample after two years or to permit or decline to have the blood sample used for public health
studies and research;
   (6) the ways in which the samples and data collected will be stored and used at the Department
of Health and elsewhere; and
  (7) the Department of Health's Web site address where the forms referenced in paragraph (b)
may be obtained.
This document satisfies the requirements of section 13.04, subdivision 2.
   (b) The parent or legal guardian of an infant otherwise subject to testing under this section may
object to any of the following:
      (1) the testing itself;
   (2) the maintenance of the infant's blood samples and test result records for a period longer than
24 months; and
    (3) the use of the infant's blood samples and test result records for public health studies and
research.
If a parent or legal guardian elects one of the alternatives, the election shall be recorded on a form
that is signed by the parent or legal guardian. The signed form shall be made part of the infant's
medical record and shall be provided to the Department of Health. The signature of the parent or
legal guardian is sufficient and no witness to the signature, photo identification, or notarization
shall be required. When a parent or legal guardian elects an alternative under this subdivision, the
Department of Health must follow the election and section 144.128. A written election exempts an
infant from the requirements of this section and section 144.128.

    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "public health studies and research" includes calibrating
newborn screening equipment, evaluating existing newborn screening tests to reduce the number of
false positive and false negative results, studying the development of new newborn screening tests
for heritable and congenital disorders, and other population-based health studies.
   Sec. 3. NEWBORN SCREENING REPORT.
    By January 15, 2010, the Department of Health shall report and make recommendations to the
legislature on its current efforts for ensuring and enhancing how parents of newborns are fully
informed about the newborn screening program and of their rights and options regarding: (1)
testing; (2) storage; (3) public health practices, studies, and research; (4) the ability to opt out of the
collection of data and specimens related to the testing; and (5) the ability to seek private testing."

conditions that guarantee the care and treatment of the patient.
   (b) A person against whom a criminal proceeding is pending may not be released.
   (c) A continuance for dismissal, with or without findings, may be granted for up to 90 days.
    (d) When the court stays an order for commitment for more than 14 days beyond the date of the
initially scheduled hearing, the court shall issue an order that must include:
   (1) a written plan for services to which the proposed patient has agreed;
    (2) a finding that the proposed treatment is available and accessible to the patient and that public
or private financial resources are available to pay for the proposed treatment; ­ an

imposition of the commitment order; and

trial while the court order is in effect.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), clause (4), during the period of a stay of commitment, the
court may allow the patient to give consent to participate in a specific psychiatric clinical drug trial if
the treating psychiatrist testifies or submits an affidavit that the patient may benefit from participating
in the trial because, after providing other treatment options for a reasonable period of time, those
options have been ineffective. The treating psychiatrist must not be the psychiatrist conducting the
psychiatric clinical drug trial. The court must determine that, under the circumstances of the case,
the patient is competent to choose to participate in the trial, that the patient is freely choosing to
participate in the trial and that the compulsion of the stayed commitment is not being used to coerce
the person to participate in the clinical trial, and that a reasonable person may choose to participate
in the clinical trial.

unincorporated area in which there is no organized township government as in need of orderly
annexation.

have identified as being appropriate for annexation, either currently or at some point in the future,
pursuant to the negotiated terms and conditions set forth in the joint resolution. Land described as a
designated area is not, by virtue of being so described, considered also to be annexed for purposes
