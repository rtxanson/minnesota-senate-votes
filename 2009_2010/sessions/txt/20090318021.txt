product for sale in this state that contains a priority chemical shall notify the agency of that fact
in writing unless the children's product is not subject to regulation under section 116.9408. This
written notice must identify the product, the number of units sold or distributed for sale in this state
or nationally during the previous calendar year, the priority chemical or chemicals contained in the
product, and the intended purpose of the priority chemicals in the product.
    Subd. 2. Supplemental information. The manufacturer or distributor of a children's product
that contains a priority chemical shall provide the following additional information if requested by
the agency:
    (1) information on the likelihood that the chemical will be released from the children's product

a safer alternative is available for the specified use of the priority chemical in a product, the agency
shall specify a reasonably expeditious timeline, not to exceed three years, by which date the priority
chemical in the children's product sold in this state must be replaced with a safer alternative. In
determining whether a safer alternative is available, the agency may, in the absence of persuasive
evidence to the contrary, presume that:
   (1) an alternative is a safer alternative if the alternative is not a chemical of high concern;
    (2) a safer alternative is available if the children's product containing the priority chemical is an
item of apparel or a novelty; and
   (3) a safer alternative is available if the alternative is sold in the United States.
    Subd. 3. Compliance plan. At least one year prior to the effective date of a prohibition adopted
under section 116.9406, the manufacturer or distributor of a children's product that contains the
priority chemical that is subject to the prohibition shall file a compliance plan with the commissioner
or seek a waiver under section 116.9407. A compliance plan must:
   (1) identify the children's product that contains the priority chemical;
   (2) specify whether compliance will be achieved by discontinuing the sale of the children's
product in this state or by substituting a safer alternative in the product; and
    (3) if compliance is achieved by substitution of a safer alternative in the product, identify the
safer alternative and the timetable for substitution.
   Sec. 6. [116.9406] PROHIBITION OF SALE.
    Subdivision 1. Agency action against product containing priority chemical. The agency shall
prohibit the sale or distribution in this state of a children's product containing a priority chemical if
the department finds that:
   (1) distribution of the children's product directly or indirectly exposes children to the priority
chemical; and
   (2) one or more safer alternatives to the priority chemical are available and are technically and
economically feasible substitutes for the specific use of the priority chemical in the product; or
   (3) the manufacturer or distributor fails to provide the information required under section
116.9404 in a timely fashion.
     Subd. 2. Notice of prohibition of sale. The agency shall notify a manufacturer or distributor of
its decision to prohibit the offering for sale in this state of a product containing a priority chemical,
unless the manufacturer or distributor has been granted a waiver under section 116.9407. The notice
of prohibition of sale must contain the effective date of the prohibition, which must be at least 270
days after the date of the notice.
   Subd. 3. Certificate of compliance. No less than 60 days prior to the effective date of the
prohibition of sale determined under section 116.9406, a manufacturer or distributor must send
736                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [21ST DAY

to the agency, in writing, a certificate of compliance certifying that after the effective date of
the prohibition, the manufacturer or distributor will not offer the product containing the priority
chemical for sale in this state, and, if applicable, that compliance will be achieved through
substitution of a safer alternative approved by the Department of Health.
    Subd. 4. Retailer notification. A manufacturer or distributor of a children's product issued a
notice of prohibition of sale under subdivision 2 shall notify, in writing, persons that offer the product
for sale or distribution in the state of the requirements of sections 116.9401 to 116.9411, and of the
effective date of the prohibition of sale. Notice under this subdivision must be issued within 30 days
of the issuance of the notice of prohibition of sale, unless the manufacturer or distributor has applied
for a waiver under section 116.9407, in which case the notice must be issued within 30 days of a
permit denial by the commissioner.
    Subd. 5. Sale of inventory. A retailer selling a children's product containing a priority chemical
that is the subject of a prohibition issued under subdivision 1 may not offer the children's product
for sale in this state after the effective date of the prohibition, except that a retailer may exhaust
stocks present in the retailer's premises 90 days prior to the effective date of the prohibition, after
providing evidence of that fact to the agency.
   Subd. 6. Exceptions. A children's product containing a priority chemical designated by the
department may continue to be sold or offered for sale in this state if:
   (1) the manufacturer or distributor obtains a waiver under section 116.9407; or
   (2) in the commissioner's judgment, the lack of availability of the children's product could pose
an unreasonable risk to public health, safety, or welfare.
   Sec. 7. [116.9407] WAIVER FOR SPECIFIC USES.
    Subdivision 1. Application for waiver. The manufacturer or distributor of a children's product
that contains a priority chemical and that is subject to a prohibition under section 116.9406 may
apply to the commissioner for a waiver for one or more specific uses of the priority chemical. The
waiver application must, at a minimum:
   (1) identify the specific children's product use or uses for which the waiver is sought;
   (2) identify the alternatives considered for substitution of the priority chemical;
   (3) explain the basis for concluding that the use of an alternative is not technically or
economically feasible; and
   (4) identify the steps that have and will be taken to minimize the use of the priority chemical.
    Subd. 2. Term of waiver. The commissioner may grant a waiver with or without conditions upon
finding that there are no technically or economically feasible alternatives for the use of the priority
chemical in the children's product. Waivers may be granted for a term not to exceed four years and
may be renewed for one or more additional four-year terms upon written application demonstrating
that technically or economically feasible alternatives remain unavailable. The commissioner shall
deny or grant waiver requests within 60 days after receipt of a completed waiver application.

     Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 10A.31, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7a. Withholding of public subsidy. If a candidate who is eligible for payment of public
subsidy under this section has not filed the report of receipts and expenditures required under section
10A.20 before a primary election, any public subsidy for which that candidate is eligible must be
withheld by the board until the candidate complies with the filing requirements of section 10A.20
and the board has sufficient time to review or audit the report. If a candidate who is eligible for public
subsidy does not file the report due before the primary election under section 10A.20 by the date
that the report of receipts and expenditures filed before the general election is due, that candidate
shall not be paid public subsidy for that election.
     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2008, section 10A.322, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Agreement by candidate. (a) As a condition of receiving a public subsidy, a
candidate must sign and file with the board a written agreement in which the candidate agrees that
the candidate will comply with sections 10A.25; 10A.27, subdivision 10; 10A.31, subdivision 7,
paragraph (c); 10A.324; and 10A.38.
    (b) Before the first day of filing for office, the board must forward agreement forms to all filing
officers. The board must also provide agreement forms to candidates on request at any time. The
candidate must file the agreement with the board by September 1 preceding the candidate's general
election or a special election held at the general election. An agreement may not be filed after that
date. An agreement once filed may not be rescinded.
   (c) The board must notify the commissioner of revenue of any agreement signed under this
subdivision.
      (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), if a vacancy occurs that will be filled by means of a special
election and the filing period does not coincide with the filing period for the general election, a
candidate may sign and submit a spending limit agreement not later than the day after the ­                 c­
