   The 2009 Session of the Eighty-Sixth Legislature convened January 6, and the Senate was

of the Committee on Rules and Administration.
   Senator David H. Senjem (R), Rochester, continued as Minority Leader.
   Senator James P. Metzen (DFL), South St. Paul, was re-elected President of the Senate.
    The following two special elections were held November 4, 2008, to fill vacancies created by
resignations:
    Lisa A. Fobbe (DFL), Zimmerman, was elected in District 16 to fill the vacancy created by the
resignation of Senator Betsy Wergin. Senator Fobbe was sworn in on December 5, 2008.
    Ken Kelash (DFL), Richfield, was elected in District 63 to fill the vacancy created by the
resignation of Senator Dan Larson. Senator Kelash was also sworn in on December 5, 2008.
   The political makeup of the 2009 Senate was 46 DFLers and 21 Republicans.
    Patrick E. Flahaven, the Secretary of the Senate since 1973, retired on January 5, 2009, after 38
years of dedicated service to the Minnesota Senate. Mr. Flahaven served with eight Senate Presidents
and 294 members during his Senate career. On January 6, 2009, the Senate elected Peter S. Wattson,
