  Sec. 5. [144.2253] ACCESS TO ORIGINAL BIRTH RECORDS BY ADOPTED PERSON;
DEPARTMENT DUTIES.
    Subdivision 1. Affidavits. The department shall prepare affidavit of disclosure and nondisclosure
forms under which a birth parent may agree to or object to the release of the original birth record to
the adopted person. The department shall make the forms readily accessible to birth parents on the
department's Web site.
    Subd. 2. Disclosure. Upon request, the state registrar shall provide a noncertified copy of the
original birth record to an adopted person age 19 or older, unless there is an affidavit of nondisclosure
on file. The state registrar must comply with the terms of affidavits of disclosure or affidavits of
nondisclosure.
    Subd. 3. Recission of affidavit. A birth parent may rescind an affidavit of disclosure or an
affidavit of nondisclosure at any time.
    Subd. 4. Affidavit of nondisclosure; access to birth record. (a) If an affidavit of nondisclosure
is on file with the registrar, an adopted person age 19 or older may petition the appropriate court for
disclosure of the original birth record pursuant to section 259.61. The court shall grant the petition if,
after consideration of the interests of all known persons affected by the petition, the court determines
that the benefits of disclosure of the information are greater than the benefits of nondisclosure.
    (b) An adopted person age 19 or older may request the state registrar to search the state death

the petitioner;
   (3) exclude the abusing party from a reasonable area surrounding the dwelling or residence,

Findings under section 257.025, 518.17, or 518.175 are not required with respect to the particular

or restrict parenting time as to time, place, duration, or supervision, or deny parenting time entirely,
as needed to guard the safety of the victim and the children. The court's decision on custody and

provided for in this section. The court must not enter a parenting plan under section 518.1705 as
part of an action for an order for protection;

action by the board if an application for registration renewal is not received before the deadline for
renewal. The registrant's failure to receive this notice does not relieve the registrant of the obligation

is not grounds for challenging expiration of registration status.

an outdoor sport equipment manufacturer in which the outdoor sport equipment dealer has complied
with the policies and procedures contained in the outdoor sport equipment manufacturer's warranty.
    Subd. 2. Prompt payment. Claims filed for payment under warranty agreements must be
approved or disapproved within 30 days after receipt by the outdoor sport equipment manufacturer.
Unless the outdoor sport equipment dealer agrees to a later date, approved claims for payment must
be paid within 30 days after approval. When a claim is disapproved, the outdoor sport equipment
manufacturer shall notify the dealer within the 30-day period stating the specific grounds on which
the disapproval is based. Any claim not specifically disapproved within 30 days of receipt is
deemed approved and must be paid within 30 days after the deemed approval.

submits a warranty claim for warranty work performed before the effective date of the termination,
the outdoor sport equipment manufacturer shall handle the claim as provided in subdivision 2.
    Subd. 4. Compensation for warranty work. Warranty work performed by the dealer must be
compensated in accordance with the reasonable and customary amount of time required to complete
the work, expressed in hours and fractions of hours multiplied by the dealer's established customer
hourly retail labor rate, which the dealer shall communicate to the outdoor sport equipment
manufacturer before performing the warranty work.
   Subd. 5. Expenses. Expenses expressly excluded under the outdoor sport equipment
manufacturer's warranty to the customer must not be included in claims and are not required to be

    Subd. 6. Compensation for parts. Payment for all parts used by the dealer in performing
warranty work must be paid to the dealer in the amount equal to the dealer's net price for the parts,
plus a minimum of 15 percent to reimburse the dealer for reasonable costs of doing business in
performing warranty service on the outdoor sport equipment manufacturer's behalf, including, but
not limited to, freight and handling costs.
    Subd. 7. Adjustment for errors. The outdoor sport equipment manufacturer may adjust for
errors discovered during audit, and if necessary, adjust claims paid in error.
    Subd. 8. Alternate terms and conditions. A dealer may choose to accept alternate
reimbursement terms and conditions in lieu of the requirements of subdivisions 2 to 7, provided
there is a written dealership agreement between the outdoor sport equipment manufacturer and the
dealer providing for compensation to the dealer for warranty labor costs either as:
   (1) a discount in the pricing of the equipment to the dealer; or
   (2) a lump-sum payment to the dealer.
The discount or lump sum must be no less than five percent of the suggested retail price of the
equipment. If the requirements of this subdivision are met and alternate terms and conditions are in
place, subdivisions 2 to 7 do not apply and the alternate terms and conditions are enforceable.
    Subd. 9. Warranty work on units not sold by the dealer. Upon request of the manufacturer or
distributor, the dealer shall perform warranty repair work on units that were not sold by the dealer.
Compensation for that work must be on the same terms and conditions otherwise required in this
section.
   Sec. 10. [80G.10] STATUS OF INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS.
   A term of a dealership agreement either expressed or implied, including a choice of law
provision that is inconsistent with sections 80G.01 to 80G.11 or that purports to waive an outdoor
sport equipment manufacturer's or distributor's compliance with sections 80G.01 to 80G.11 is
void and unenforceable and does not waive any rights provided to a person by sections 80G.01 to
80G.11.
   Sec. 11. [80G.11] REMEDIES.
    If either party to a dealership agreement violates any provision of sections 80G.01 to 80G.11,
the other party may bring an action against the alleged violator in a court of competent jurisdiction
for damages sustained by the allegedly wronged party as a consequence of the violation, and
the allegedly wronged party may also be granted injunctive relief against any action or inaction
prohibited under sections 80G.01 to 80G.11. The remedies in this section are in addition to any
other remedies permitted by law.
   Sec. 12. [80G.12] APPLICABILITY.
    Sections 80G.01 to 80G.11 are effective August 1, 2008, and apply to all dealership agreements
entered into, amended, or renewed on or after that date. Any dealership agreement in force and effect
on August 1, 2008, that has a stated expiration date after that date and is not renewed or amended
on or after August 1, 2008, is not subject to sections 80G.01 to 80G.11. Sections 80G.01 to 80G.11
apply as of August 1, 2008, to any dealership agreement then in effect that has no stated expiration

under section 62J.536.
    (b) The commission shall only use the data submitted under paragraph (a) for the purpose of
carrying out its responsibilities in designing and implementing a payment restructuring system.
If the commission contracts with other organizations or entities to carry out any of its duties or
responsibilities described in this chapter, the contract must require that the organization or entity
maintain the data that it receives according to the provisions of this section.
    (c) Data on providers collected under this subdivision are private data on individuals or
nonpublic data, as defined in section 13.02. Notwithstanding the definition of summary data in

identify, individual patients.
    (e) The commission may publish analyses and reports that identify specific providers but only
after the provider has been provided the opportunity by the commission to review the data and
submit comments. The provider shall have 21 days to review and comment, after which time the
commission may release the data along with any comments submitted by the provider.
    Subd. 3. Utilization and health care costs. (a) The commission shall develop a method of
calculating the relative utilization and health care costs of providers. The method must exclude
the costs of catastrophic cases and must include risk adjustments to reflect differences in the
demographics, health, and special needs of the providers' patient population. The risk adjustment
must be developed in accordance with generally accepted risk adjustment methodologies.
    (b) Beginning April 1, 2010, the commission shall disseminate information to providers on their
utilization and cost in comparison to an appropriate peer group.
    (c) The commission shall develop a system to index providers based on their total risk-adjusted
resource use and quality of care, and separately for the conditions of coronary artery and heart
disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression. In developing
this system, the commission shall consult and coordinate with health care providers, health plan
companies, and organizations that work to improve health care quality in Minnesota.
    Subd. 4. Chronic care package pricing and total care bids. (a) The commission shall develop
a standard method and format for providers to use for submitting package prices for the total cost of
care or separately for the conditions of coronary artery and heart disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, or depression. This method shall be published in the State Register
and must be made available to all providers.
    (b) Beginning July 1, 2010, and annually thereafter, using the information developed in
subdivision 3, providers may submit package prices to the commission for the cost of providing
all necessary services to a patient or separately for the cost of providing services for patients with
the chronic conditions of coronary artery and heart disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, or depression based on their disclosed prices under section 62U.11 combined
with their actual risk-adjusted resource use for the most recent analytic period. The package prices
submitted must reflect the providers' commitment to manage their risk-adjusted patient population
within this cost.
    (c) Until January 1, 2013, no provider shall submit a package price for the risk-adjusted cost of
care that represents an increase of more than the increase in the previous calendar year's Consumer
Price Index for all urban consumers plus two percentage points or a decrease of more than 15 percent
below the provider's risk-adjusted cost of care calculated based on their average pricing levels for
the previous calendar year.
    (d) Beginning January 1, 2011, the commission shall annually publish the results of the process
described in paragraph (b), and shall include only providers who choose to submit package prices.
The results that are published must be on a risk-neutral basis. Effective January 1, 2012, the
published results shall include all providers. For providers that have not submitted package prices,
these results must be based on their weighted average contract prices for all health plan companies
and third-party administrators, combined with their risk-adjusted historic resource use.

    Subd. 5. Provider assistance. The commission shall provide education and technical assistance
to providers on how to calculate and submit package prices for the risk-adjusted cost of care for the
total cost of care and separately for the conditions of coronary artery and heart disease, diabetes,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression.
    Subd. 6. Payments. The commission shall establish a method by which providers who have
submitted a package price shall be paid for their total cost of care or separately for their cost of care in
treating patients with the conditions of coronary artery and heart disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression. The method must include periodic adjustments to
payments to reflect providers' actual risk-adjusted cost relative to their package price.
   Subd. 7. Implementation. By January 1, 2012:
    (1) the commissioner of human services shall pay providers based on their package prices for
all enrollees in the state's public health care programs;
    (2) the commissioner of employee relations shall pay providers based on their package prices
for participants in the state employee group program;
    (3) all political subdivisions as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 11, that offer health benefits
to their employees must pay providers based on their package prices or purchase a health plan that
uses this payment system;
    (4) all health plan companies shall use the information and methods developed under this section
to develop products that encourage consumers to use high-quality, low-cost providers; and
    (5) health plan companies that issue health plans in the individual market or the small employer
market must offer at least one health plan that uses the information developed under subdivision 3
to establish financial incentives for consumers to choose high-quality, low-cost providers through
enrollee cost-sharing or selective provider networks."

to develop a model that will assess the impact of proposed health care reforms or major health
care-related legislation on all sectors of the health care system, including access to the full
range of health care, public health, public and private health insurance coverage, long-term and
continuing care, programs for persons with disabilities, social services and other sectors related to
Minnesotans' health. The model must be:
   (1) developed with safeguards to make sure that the model and its assumptions and formulas are
based on valid and objective data, research, and expert opinions;
    (2) designed to enable policy makers and state agencies to enter into the model and study each
component of health care reform, including access to all aspects of health care services, health care
homes, payment reforms, population-wide prevention, health status of Minnesotans, and incidence
of chronic disease;
    (3) capable of assessing the interaction of different legislative and policy changes to determine
the net effect on costs, access, and health status within sectors of the health care system, and the net
overall impact across all sectors;
    (4) designed to identify risks of unpredictable or unintended consequences, cost shifting between
or within sectors of the health care system, and opportunities to make changes in one sector that will
produce a benefit to other sectors; and
    (5) capable of being adjusted based on both the proposed changes and the resulting impact in
the following areas:
   (i) access to all aspects of health care services;
   (ii) health status of Minnesotans, including the incidence of chronic disease, health disparities,
and risk factors such as obesity and smoking;
   (iii) utilization of preventive care services such as screenings, immunizations, and physical
examinations; and

of the senate and house health care policy and finance committees, shall develop recommendations
for the governor and the legislature on changes to state budgeting approaches and legislative

of proposed legislative changes across these boundaries and to allow the reallocation of resources
across boundaries. These approaches shall also cover a time period longer than the existing
two-year budgeting cycle so that longer term return-on-investment projections can be considered
when making short-term budget decisions.
   Sec. 22. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF HEALTH CARE REFORM PLANS.
    (a) The commissioner of health shall award a grant to the University of Minnesota School
of Public Health, health policy and management division, to conduct a study and economic
analysis of costs and benefits of various health care reform proposals, including an analysis
of the recommendations of the Legislative Health Care Access Commission, the governor's
transformation task force, and a single statewide plan.
    (b) The analysis of each proposal should measure the impact on total public and private health
care spending in Minnesota that would result from each proposal, including whether there are
savings or additional costs due to:
   (1) increased or reduced insurance, billing, underwriting, marketing, and other administrative
functions;
   (2) timely and appropriate use of medical care;
   (3) market-driven or negotiated prices on medical services and products, including
pharmaceuticals;
   (4) a shortage or excess capacity of medical facilities and equipment;
    (5) increased utilization, better health outcomes, increased wellness due to prevention, early
intervention, and health-promoting activities;
    (6) increases or decreases in administrative expenses and health care expenses due to payment
reforms;
   (7) increases or decreases in administrative expenses and health care expenses due to
coordination of care;
   (8) increases or decreases in up-front and long-term utilization due to access to comprehensive
medically necessary benefits, including dental care, mental health care, prescription drugs, and other
health care; and
   (9) nonhealth care impacts on state and local expenditures such as reduced out-of-home

placement or crime costs due to mental health or chemical dependency coverage.
    (c) The study should also analyze for each proposal the number of Minnesotans without access
to health care, including those lacking access to certain types of medical care, such as dental care,
mental health care, and prescription drugs."

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 477A.011, subdivision 34, is amended to read:
    Subd. 34. City revenue need. (a) For a city with a population equal to or greater than 2,500,
"city revenue need" is the sum of (1) 5.0734098 times the pre-1940 housing percentage; plus (2)
19.141678 times the population decline percentage; plus (3) 2504.06334 times the road accidents
factor; plus (4) 355.0547; minus (5) the metropolitan area factor; minus (6) 49.10638 times the
household size. The city revenue need under this paragraph may not be less than 290.
    (b) For a city with a population less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) 2.387 times
the pre-1940 housing percentage; plus (2) 2.67591 times the commercial industrial percentage;
plus (3) 3.16042 times the population decline percentage; plus (4) 1.206 times the transformed
population; minus (5) 62.772.
    (c) For a city with a population of 2,500 or more and a population in one of the most recently
available five years that was less than 2,500, "city revenue need" is the sum of (1) its city revenue
need calculated under paragraph (a) multiplied by its transition factor; plus (2) its city revenue
need calculated under the formula in paragraph (b) multiplied by the difference between one and its
transition factor. For purposes of this paragraph, a city's "transition factor" is equal to 0.2 multiplied
by the number of years that the city's population estimate has been 2,500 or more. This provision
only applies for aids payable in calendar years 2006 to 2008 to cities with a 2002 population of less
than 2,500. It applies to any city for aids payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   (d) The city revenue need cannot be less than zero.
    (e) For calendar year 2005 and subsequent years, the city revenue need for a city, as determined
in paragraphs (a) to (d), is multiplied by the ratio of the annual implicit price deflator for government
consumption expenditures and gross investment for state and local governments as prepared by the
United States Department of Commerce, for the most recently available year to the 2003 implicit
price deflator for state and local government purchases.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year 2009 and
thereafter.

    Subd. 6. Out-of-home placement aid. In calendar year 2009 only, $500,000 shall be distributed
to any county in which the percentage of households receiving food stamps divided by its
age-adjusted population is greater than five percent using data for county program aid certified for
aids payable in 2008. The aid must be used to meet the county's cost of out-of-home placement
programs.

distribution under this subdivision equal to the product of (i) its agricultural property factor, (ii)
its town area factor, (iii) its population factor, and (iv) 0.00225. As used in this subdivision, the
following terms have the meanings given them:
    (1) "agricultural property factor" means the ratio of the adjusted net tax capacity of agricultural
property located in a town, divided by the adjusted net tax capacity of all other property located in
the town. The agricultural property factor cannot exceed eight;
   (2) "agricultural property" means property classified under section 273.13, as homestead
and nonhomestead agricultural property, timber land, and noncommercial seasonal recreational
property;
    (3) "town area factor" means the most recent estimate of total acreage, not to exceed 50,000 acres,
located in the township available as of July 1 in the aid calculation year, estimated or established by:
    (i) the United States Bureau of the Census;

     (ii) the State Land Management Information Center; or
     (iii) the secretary of state; and
     (4) "population factor" means the square root of the town's population.
    If the sum of the aids payable to all towns under this subdivision exceeds the limit under section
477A.03, subdivision 2c, the distribution to each town must be reduced proportionately so that the
total amount of aids distributed under this section does not exceed the limit in section 477A.03,
subdivision 2c.

No city may have a formula aid amount less than zero. The need increase percentage must be the
same for all cities.
    The applicable need increase percentage must be calculated by the Department of Revenue so
that the total of the aid under subdivision 9 equals the total amount available for aid under section
477A.03 after the subtraction under section 477A.014, subdivisions 4 and 5.

    (e) If a city's net tax capacity used in calculating aid under this section has decreased in any year
by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (c) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 477A.013, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 11. 2009 aid adjustment. If the limit under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, for aids
payable in 2009 is less than $575,052,000, the aid paid to each city under this section is equal to
the sum of (1) the amount the city received under subdivision 9 in calendar year 2008 and (2) an
adjustment percentage multiplied by the difference between what the city received in subdivision
9 in calendar year 2008 and its aid in calendar year 2009 under subdivision 9. The "adjustment
percentage," which is the same for all cities, is the percentage necessary for the total aids under this
section to equal the amount available under section 477A.03, subdivision 2a, after the subtraction
under section 477A.014, subdivisions 4 and 5.

member and one who is a minority party member. The remaining members must represent local
units of government. The chairs of the divisions of the tax committees having jurisdiction over
property taxes shall also be members and shall serve as co-chairs of the study group. The study
shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of existing disparities in the distribution of local
government aid, an analysis of current law need and capacity factors as well as alternative need

formula used to calculate aid for small cities, and volatility in the local government aid distribution.
The group must report on its specific recommendations to the legislature by December 15, 2010.

estate; or
   (3) is the homestead of a shareholder in a family farm corporation as defined in section 500.24,
notwithstanding the fact that legal title to the real estate may be held in the name of the family farm
corporation; or
    (4) is in the possession of a nursery or greenhouse or an entity owned by a proprietor, partnership,
or corporation which also owns the nursery or greenhouse operations on the parcel or parcels,
provided that only the acreage that is used to grow nursery stock qualify for treatment under this
section.
   (b) Valuation of real estate under this section is limited to parcels the ownership of which is in
noncorporate entities except for:
     (1) family farm corporations organized pursuant to section 500.24; and
    (2) corporations that derive 80 percent or more of their gross receipts from the wholesale or
retail sale of horticultural or nursery stock.
    (c) Land that previously qualified for tax deferment under this section and no longer qualifies
because it is not primarily used for agricultural purposes but would otherwise qualify under
subdivisions 3 and 6 for a period of at least three years will not be required to make payment of
the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land
prior to the expiration of the three-year period requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale
in the year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus
payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years; sale during the second year the land no longer
qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes
for the prior year; and sale during the third year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of
the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to
subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the
end of the three-year period, whichever comes first, all deferred special assessments plus interest
are payable in equal installments spread over the time remaining until the last maturity date of the
bonds issued to finance the improvement for which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have
matured, the deferred special assessments plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions
of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to the collection of these installments. Penalties are not
imposed on any such special assessments if timely paid.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

      Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 16. Agricultural value determination. (a) In order to account for the presence of
nonagricultural influences that may affect the sales of agricultural land, the commissioner of
revenue shall develop a fair and uniform method of determining, for each county in the state, a
median agricultural value that is consistent with subdivision 4. The commissioner shall annually
assign the resulting agricultural value to each county, and this value shall be used as the median
agricultural value for the county under this section.
    (b) When property classified as agricultural is sold and the purchaser changes its use in a
manner that would result in a change of classification of the property, and the sale price exceeds the
agricultural value determined under paragraph (a), the assessor and the commissioner must review
the sale along with other appropriate sales information to determine if there are nonagricultural
influences on the value. If upon review it is determined that nonagricultural factors have affected
the value, the resulting sales ratio shall be excluded from use in any study measuring agricultural
value and applied to a study measuring market value.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010 and
thereafter.
      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Implementation of program. This section must be applied to eligible properties by
all county assessors, beginning no later than assessments for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010,
and thereafter, unless the commissioner of revenue determines that a county is unable to comply
with this requirement, in which case the county must implement it for the earliest assessment year
determined by the commissioner to be feasible.
  Sec. 15. [273.1115] AGGREGATE RESOURCE PRESERVATION PROPERTY TAX
LAW.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, "commercial aggregate deposit" and
"actively mined" have the meanings given them in section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h).
    Subd. 2. Requirement. Real estate is entitled to valuation under this section only if all of the
following requirements are met:
      (1) the property is classified 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b property under section 273.13, subdivisions 22 and
23;
      (2) the property is at least ten contiguous acres, when the application is filed under subdivision
3;
    (3) the owner has filed a completed application for deferment as specified in subdivision 3 with
the county assessor in the county in which the property is located;
      (4) there are no delinquent taxes on the property; and
      (5) a covenant on the land restricts its use as provided in subdivision 3, clause (4).
  Subd. 3. Application. Application for valuation deferment under this section must be filed by
May 1 of the assessment year. Any application filed and granted continues in effect for subsequent
95TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2008                                       8033

years until the property no longer qualifies, provided that supplemental affidavits under subdivision
8 are timely filed. The application must be filed with the assessor of the county in which the real
property is located on such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner of revenue. The
application must be executed and acknowledged in the manner required by law to execute and
acknowledge a deed and must contain at least the following information and any other information
the commissioner deems necessary:
   (1) the legal description of the area;
   (2) the name and address of owner;
   (3) a copy of the affidavit filed under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h), when
property is classified as:
   (i) 2b under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (b), clause (4);
   (ii) 1b under section 273.13, subdivision 22, paragraph (b);
   (iii) 2a under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a); or
   (iv) 2b under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3).
    The application must include a similar document with the same information as contained in the
affidavit under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h); and
    (4) a statement of proof from the owner that the land contains a restrictive covenant limiting
its use for the property's surface to that which exists on the date of the application and limiting its
future use to the preparation and removal of the commercial aggregate deposit under its surface. To
qualify under this clause, the covenant must be binding on the owner or the owner's successor or
assignee, and run with the land, except as provided in subdivision 5 allowing for the cancellation of
the covenant under certain conditions.
    Subd. 4. Determination of value. Upon timely application by the owner as provided in
subdivision 3, notwithstanding sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11, the value of any
qualifying land described in subdivision 3 must be valued as if it were agricultural property, using a
per acre valuation equal to the current assessment year's average per acre valuation of agricultural
land in the county. The assessor shall not consider any additional value resulting from potential
alternative and future uses of the property. The buildings located on the land shall be valued by the
assessor in the normal manner.
    Subd. 5. Cancellation of covenant. The covenant required under subdivision 3 may be canceled
in two ways:
    (1) by the owner beginning with the next subsequent assessment year provided that the additional
taxes as determined under subdivision 7 are paid by the owner at the time of cancellation; or
    (2) by the city or town in which the property is located beginning with the next subsequent
assessment year, if the city council or town board:
   (i) changes the conditional use of the property;
   (ii) revokes the mining permit; or
8034                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [95TH DAY

   (iii) changes the zoning to disallow mining.
   No additional taxes are imposed on the property under this clause.
    Subd. 6. County termination. Within two years of the effective date of this section, a county
may, following notice and public hearing, terminate application of this section in the county. The
termination is effective upon adoption of a resolution of the county board. A county has 60 days
from receipt of the first application for enrollment under this section to notify the applicant and any
subsequent applicants of the county's intent to begin the process of terminating application of this
section in the county. The county must act on the termination within six months. Upon termination
by a vote of the county board, all applications received prior to and during notification of intent
to terminate shall be deemed void. If the county board does not act on the termination within six
months of notification, all applications for valuation for deferment received shall be deemed eligible
for consideration to be enrolled under this section. Following this initial 60-day grace period, a
termination applies prospectively and does not affect property enrolled under this section prior to
the termination date. A county may reauthorize application of this section by a resolution of the
county board revoking the termination.
    Subd. 7. Additional taxes. When real property which has been valued and assessed under this
section no longer qualifies, the portion of the land classified under subdivision 2, clause (1), is subject
to additional taxes. The additional tax amount is determined by:
    (1) computing the difference between (i) the current year's taxes determined in accordance with
subdivision 4, and (ii) an amount as determined by the assessor based upon the property's current
year's estimated market value of like real estate at its highest and best use and the appropriate local
tax rate; and
    (2) multiplying the amount determined in clause (1) by the number of years the land was in the
program under this section. The current year's estimated market value as determined by the assessor
must not exceed the market value that would result if the property was sold in an arms-length
transaction and must not be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the
property been used in lieu of that market value. The additional taxes must be extended against the
property on the tax list for the current year, except that interest or penalties must not be levied on
these additional taxes if timely paid. The additional tax under this subdivision must not be imposed
on that portion of the property which has actively been mined and has been removed from the
program based upon the supplemental affidavits filed under subdivision 8.
    Subd. 8. Supplemental affidavits; mining activity on land. When any portion of the property
begins to be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the
day any aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being
mined. The acres actively being mined shall be (1) valued and classified under section 273.13,
subdivision 24, in the next subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource
preservation property tax program under this section. The additional taxes under subdivision 7 must
not be imposed on the acres that are actively being mined and have been removed from the program
under this section. Copies of the original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed
with the county assessor, the local zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Land and Minerals. A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent
portion of the property is actively mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres,
even if the actual mining activity constitutes less than five acres. Failure to file the affidavits timely

shall result in the property losing its valuation deferment under this section, and additional taxes
must be imposed as calculated under subdivision 7.
    Subd. 9. Lien. The additional tax imposed by this section is a lien upon the property assessed to
the same extent and for the same duration as other taxes imposed upon property within this state and,
when collected, must be distributed in the manner provided by law for the collection and distribution
of other property taxes.
    Subd. 10. Continuation of tax treatment upon sale. When real property qualifying under
subdivision 2 is sold, additional taxes must not be extended against the property if the property
continues to qualify under subdivision 2, and the new owner files an application with the assessor
for continued deferment within 30 days after the sale.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes assessed in 2009, payable in 2010, and
thereafter, except that for the 2009 assessment year, the application date under subdivision 5 shall
be September 1, 2009, and subdivision 6 is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.112, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Requirements. Real estate shall be entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this
section only if it is:
   (a) actively and exclusively devoted to golf, skiing, lawn bowling, croquet, polo, soccer, or
archery or firearms range recreational use or other recreational uses carried on at the establishment;
     (b) five acres in size or more, except in the case of a lawn bowling or croquet green or an archery
or firearms range;
    (c)(1) operated by private individuals or, in the case of a lawn bowling or croquet green, by
private individuals or corporations, and open to the public; or
   (2) operated by firms or corporations for the benefit of employees or guests; or
    (3) operated by private clubs having a membership of 50 or more or open to the public, provided
that the club does not discriminate in membership requirements or selection on the basis of sex or
marital status; and
    (d) made available for use in the case of real estate devoted to golf without discrimination on
the basis of sex during the time when the facility is open to use by the public or by members, except
that use for golf may be restricted on the basis of sex no more frequently than one, or part of one,
weekend each calendar month for each sex and no more than two, or part of two, weekdays each
week for each sex.
    If a golf club membership allows use of golf course facilities by more than one adult per
membership, the use must be equally available to all adults entitled to use of the golf course under
the membership, except that use may be restricted on the basis of sex as permitted in this section.
Memberships that permit play during restricted times may be allowed only if the restricted times
apply to all adults using the membership. A golf club may not offer a membership or golfing
privileges to a spouse of a member that provides greater or less access to the golf course than is
provided to that person's spouse under the same or a separate membership in that club, except that
the terms of a membership may provide that one spouse may have no right to use the golf course at
8036                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [95TH DAY

any time while the other spouse may have either limited or unlimited access to the golf course.
    A golf club may have or create an individual membership category which entitles a member
for a reduced rate to play during restricted hours as established by the club. The club must have on
record a written request by the member for such membership.
    A golf club that has food or beverage facilities or services must allow equal access to those
facilities and services for both men and women members in all membership categories at all times.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require service or access to facilities to persons
under the age of 21 years or require any act that would violate law or ordinance regarding sale,
consumption, or regulation of alcoholic beverages.
   For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 7a, discrimination means a pattern or course of
conduct and not linked to an isolated incident.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
  Sec. 17. [273.113] TAX CREDIT FOR PROPERTY IN BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS
MANAGEMENT ZONES.
   Subdivision 1. Definition. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meaning
given to them:
    (1) "bovine tuberculosis management zone" means the area within the ten-mile radius around
the five presumptive tuberculosis-positive deer sampled during the fall 2006 hunter-harvested
surveillance effort; and
   (2) "located within" means that the herd is kept in the area for at least a part of the year.
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; amount of credit. Agricultural land classified as class 2a or 2b under section
273.13, subdivision 23, located in a bovine tuberculosis management zone is eligible for a property
tax credit if the owner has eradicated a cattle herd that had been located within that land in order to
prevent the onset or spreading of bovine tuberculosis. The credit is equal to the property tax on the
parcel where the herd had been located. To begin to qualify for the tax credit, the owner shall file
an application with the county by January 2 of the year after the calendar year when the herd was
eradicated. The credit must be given for each payable tax year following the calendar year when
the herd was eradicated and must terminate for all payable tax years beginning after the calendar
year when a new herd of cattle was placed on the land. The assessor shall indicate the amount of the
property tax reduction on the property tax statement of each taxpayer receiving a credit under this
section. The credit paid pursuant to this section shall be deducted from the tax due on the property
as provided in section 273.1393.
    Subd. 3. Reimbursement for lost revenue. The county auditor shall certify to the commissioner
of revenue, as part of the abstracts of tax lists required to be filed with the commissioner under
section 275.29, the amount of tax lost to the county from the property tax credit under subdivision
2. Any prior year adjustments must also be certified in the abstracts of tax lists. The commissioner
of revenue shall review the certifications to determine their accuracy. The commissioner may make
the changes in the certification that are considered necessary or return a certification to the county
auditor for corrections. The commissioner shall reimburse each taxing district for the taxes lost.
The payments must be made at the time provided in section 273.1398, subdivision 6, for payment
to taxing jurisdictions in the same proportion that the ad valorem tax is distributed. The amount

      ) The limitation in this section does not apply to buildings containing fewer than four
residential units or to a single rented or leased dwelling unit located within or attached to a private
garage or similar structure owned by the owner of a homestead and located on the premises of
that homestead. If the assessor has classified a property as both homestead and nonhomestead, the
reductions in tax provided under sections 273.135 and 273.1391 apply to the value of both the
homestead and the nonhomestead portions of the property.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2008, payable in 2009, and
thereafter.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 23, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 2, section 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) Class 2a property is agricultural land including any improvements that is
homesteaded. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of
land has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22. The value of the remaining
land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead property
has a net class rate of ­
                        0­5  ­ 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first tier has
                          .­ 5
a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier valuation
limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under section
273.11, subdivision 23.

airport; or (4) land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being mined and is not
otherwise classified as class 2a under paragraph (a) or 2b, under clauses (1) to (3). Class 2b property
has a net class rate of one percent of market value, except that property described in clause (1) has
a net class rate of .65 percent if it consists of no more than 1,920 acres and is being managed under
a forest management plan that meets the requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the
sustainable forest resource management incentive program, provided that the owner of the property
must apply to the assessor annually to receive the reduced class rate and provide the information
required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.

section means the raising or cultivation of agricultural products. "Agricultural purposes" also
includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535 or
the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 or a similar state
or federal conservation program, but only if the property was classified as agricultural (i) under
this subdivision for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the year prior to its enrollment. Contiguous
acreage on the same parcel, or contiguous acreage on an immediately adjacent parcel under the
same ownership, may also qualify as agricultural land, but only if it is pasture, timber, waste,
unusable wild land, or land included in state or federal farm programs. Agricultural classification
for property shall be determined excluding the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one
acre of land, and shall not be based upon the market value of any residential structures on the
parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.

    (1) at least ten contiguous acres were tilled or pastured to produce an agricultural product for
sale in three of the last five years;
   (2) at least 75 percent of the acres are used exclusively for storage of grain or storage of
machinery or equipment used to support the agricultural activities on other parcels under the same
ownership;
    (3) the entire parcel is tilled or used for pasture;
   (4) the land mass contains a licensed nursery, provided that only those acres used to produce
nursery stock are considered agricultural land;
    (5) the parcel is used primarily for a livestock or poultry confinement process; or
    (6) the parcel is used primarily for market farming; for purposes of this subdivision, "market
farming" means the cultivation of one or more fruits or vegetables or production of animal or other
agricultural products for sale to local markets by the farmer or an organization with which the farmer
is affiliated.
95TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2008                                            8039

   Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
    An assessor may classify the part of a parcel described in this paragraph that is used for
agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b, whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the
class appropriate to its use.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (e) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or
cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (f) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for

the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (g) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), a privately owned public use
airport must be licensed as a public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of paragraph (b),
clause (4), "landing area" means that part of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared,
regularly maintained, and made available to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways,
taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area
also includes land underlying both the primary surface and the approach surfaces that comply with
all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under paragraph (b), clause (4), must be described and certified
by the commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the
airport or landing area no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (4). For purposes
of paragraph (b), clause (4), "public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp,
apron, or storage hangar, or an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
   (h) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), the property must be at least ten
contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property must record with the county recorder of the
county in which the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction

aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (i) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or subdivision 22 begins to be
actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the day any
aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being mined.
The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under subdivision 24 in the next
subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource preservation property
tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program. Copies of the
original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor, the local
zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and Minerals.
A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is actively
mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining activity
constitutes less than five acres.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
    Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
    Subd. 24. Class 3. (a) Commercial and industrial property and utility real and personal property
is class 3a.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided, each parcel of commercial, industrial, or utility real property
has a class rate of 1.5 percent of the first tier of market value, and 2.0 percent of the remaining market
value. In the case of contiguous parcels of property owned by the same person or entity, only the
value equal to the first-tier value of the contiguous parcels qualifies for the reduced class rate, except
that contiguous parcels owned by the same person or entity shall be eligible for the first-tier value
class rate on each separate business operated by the owner of the property, provided the business
is housed in a separate structure. For the purposes of this subdivision, the first tier means the first
$150,000 of market value. Real property owned in fee by a utility for transmission line right-of-way
shall be classified at the class rate for the higher tier.
    For purposes of this subdivision, parcels are considered to be contiguous even if they are
separated from each other by a road, street, waterway, or other similar intervening type of property.
Connections between parcels that consist of power lines or pipelines do not cause the parcels to
be contiguous. Property owners who have contiguous parcels of property that constitute separate
businesses that may qualify for the first-tier class rate shall notify the assessor by July 1, for
treatment beginning in the following taxes payable year.

is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is used

for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property must provide recreational activities such as renting ice
fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide
marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad
offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c is also class 4c regardless of the

4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to

according to its highest and best use permitted under the local zoning ordinance. If the ordinance
permits more than one use, the land must be classified according to the highest and best use permitted

use of the unimproved land based upon the use made of surrounding land or land in proximity to
the unimproved land.

    Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 280.39, as amended by Laws 2008, chapter 154, article
2, section 22, is amended to read:
   280.39 DELINQUENT TAXES MAY BE PAID IN INVERSE ORDER.
    In any case where taxes for two or more years are delinquent against a parcel of land, the taxes,
or a portion of them, if held by the state, may be paid in the inverse order to that in which the taxes
were levied, with accrued penalties, interest, and costs upon the taxes so paid, without payment of
the taxes for the first of such years; provided, that such payment shall not affect the lien of any
unpaid taxes or tax judgment. Payments for delinquent taxes for a part of a year may be accepted
if payment is received under section 290A.10, and must be applied in the order specified in this
section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290A.10, is amended to read:
   290A.10 PROOF OF TAXES PAID.
    Subdivision 1. Generally. Every claimant who files a claim for relief for property taxes payable
shall include with the claim a property tax statement or a reproduction thereof in a form deemed
satisfactory by the commissioner of revenue indicating that there are no delinquent property taxes
on the homestead. Indication on the property tax statement from the county treasurer that there are
no delinquent taxes on the homestead shall be sufficient proof. Taxes included in a confession of
judgment under section 279.37 shall not constitute delinquent taxes as long as the claimant is current
on the payments required to be made under section 279.37.
    Subd. 2. Delinquent taxes. The governing body of a county may, by resolution, allow claimants
who would otherwise qualify for a refund, except for a property tax delinquency under sections
279.02 and 279.03 on the homestead, to be eligible for the refund but only if the refund is sent by
electronic payment to the county where the homestead on which property taxes are delinquent is
located, to be applied to the claimant's delinquent taxes under section 280.39.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for claims based on taxes payable in 2009 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 365.243, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3. Levy for first responder association. A county board may annually levy taxes on
property located within the area of unorganized territory to which a first responder or fire protection
association provides first responder services. By July 1 of the levy year, the association must certify
to the county board the area of the unorganized township to which the association will provide first
responder services during the following calendar year. The proceeds of the levy must be distributed
to the association.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 365A.095, is amended to read:
  365A.095 PETITION FOR REMOVAL OF DISTRICT; PROCEDURE; REFUND OF
SURPLUS.
95TH DAY]                                            THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2008                                                                            8051

    Subdivision 1. Petition; procedure. A petition signed by at least 75 percent of the property
owners in the territory of the subordinate service district requesting the removal of the district may be
presented to the town board. Within 30 days after the town board receives the petition, the town clerk
shall determine the validity of the signatures on the petition. If the requisite number of signatures
are certified as valid, the town board must hold a public hearing on the petitioned matter. Within 30
days after the end of the hearing, the town board must decide whether to discontinue the subordinate
service district, continue as it is, or take some other action with respect to it.
    Subd. 2. Option to refund surplus. If the district is removed under subdivision 1, after all
outstanding obligations of the district have been paid in full, the town board may vote to refund
any surplus tax revenue or service charge, or any part of it, collected from the district under
section 365A.08. The refund must be distributed equally to the owners of any property within the
discontinued district that were charged the extra tax or service fee during the most recent tax year
for which the tax or service fee was imposed. Any surplus not refunded under this section must be
transferred to the town's general fund.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.446, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

determined under subdivision 2, or (2) the amount otherwise provided by law without regard to
the provisions of this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Determination of maximum tax amount. The maximum tax amount is the amount
of property taxes payable in the base year, but increased by any tax amounts attributable to (1) an
increase after the base year in the square footage of the dwelling, (2) the market value of any other
improvements made after the base year exceeding 15 percent of the estimated market value of the
homestead for the assessment year prior to the year the improvements are initially assessed, or (3)
voter-approved levies exceeding the amount attributable to voter-approved levies in the base year.
   Sec. 2. [290D.02] DEFINITIONS.
   (a) For purposes of this chapter, the terms in this section have the meanings given them.
    (b) "Base year" means the taxes payable year in which the taxpayer is qualified and in which the
taxpayer has applied to the commissioner of revenue and been initially approved for the program
for taxes payable in the following year by the commissioner under section 290D.04.
   (c) "Property taxes payable" means the net property taxes payable on the qualified homestead
excluding special assessments, interest, and penalties, and before any refund under chapter 290A.

and so much of the land surrounding it as is reasonably necessary for use of the dwelling as a
home and any other property used for purposes of a homestead as defined in section 273.13,
subdivisions 22 and 23, but not to exceed the immediately surrounding one acre of land in the case
of homestead property classified under section 273.13, subdivision 23. The homestead may be part

    The qualifications for participation in the maximum homestead property tax program are as
follows:
    (1) the property must be owned and occupied as a homestead in a county that has approved the
program by a person 65 years of age or older. In the case of a married couple, both the spouses must
be at least 65 years old regardless of whether the property is titled in the name of one spouse or both
spouses, or titled in another way that permits the property to have homestead status;
    (2) the taxpayer's total household income, as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 5, for the
calendar year preceding the year of the initial application may not exceed $40,000; and
    (3) the homestead must have been owned and occupied as the homestead of at least one of the
taxpayers for at least 25 years prior to the year the initial application is filed, regardless of whether
the property is titled in the name of one spouse or both spouses, or a surviving spouse, or titled in
any other way that permits the property to have homestead classification.
   Sec. 4. [290D.04] APPLICATION.
    Subdivision 1. Initial application. A qualified taxpayer may apply to the commissioner of
revenue for participation in the program. Applications are due on or before June 1 for taxes payable
the following year. A taxpayer may apply in the year in which the taxpayer becomes 65 years old.
The application, prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, must include:
   (1) the name, address, and Social Security number of the owner or owners;
   (2) a copy of the property tax statement for the current payable year for the homestead property;
   (3) the initial year of ownership and occupancy as a homestead;
   (4) the owner's household income for the previous calendar year; and
   (5) any other information the commissioner deems necessary.
    Subd. 2. Approval; notification. The commissioner shall approve an initial application
that qualifies under this chapter and shall notify the taxpayer on or before September 1. The
commissioner may investigate the facts or require confirmation in regard to an application.
    Subd. 3. Excess-income certification by taxpayer. The maximum tax amount does not apply
for any assessment year for a taxpayer whose total household income for the previous year exceeds
$40,000. A taxpayer whose initial application has been approved under subdivision 2 shall notify
the commissioner of revenue in writing by June 1 if the taxpayer's household income for the
preceding calendar year exceeded $40,000. The certification must state the homeowner's total
household income for the previous calendar year. Participation in the program under this chapter is
not allowed in any year following the year in which a program participant filed or should have filed
an excess-income certification under this subdivision, unless the participant has filed a resumption
of eligibility certification as described in subdivision 4. On or before September 1 each year, the
commissioner shall notify the county auditor that the homestead no longer qualifies for a maximum
tax amount.
    Subd. 4. Resumption of eligibility certification by taxpayer. A taxpayer who has previously
filed an excess-income certification under subdivision 3 may resume program participation if the
taxpayer's household income for a subsequent year is $40,000 or less. If the taxpayer chooses to
8056                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [95TH DAY

resume program participation, the taxpayer must notify the commissioner of revenue in writing by
June 1 of the year following a calendar year in which the taxpayer's household income is $40,000
or less. The certification must state the taxpayer's total household income for the previous calendar
year. Once a taxpayer resumes participation in the program under this subdivision, participation
will continue until the taxpayer files a subsequent excess-income certification under subdivision 3 or
until participation is terminated under section 290D.06. On or before September 1, the commissioner
shall notify the county auditor that the homestead qualifies for the maximum tax amount certified
under section 290D.05, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 5. Penalty for failure to file excess-income certification; investigations. (a) The
commissioner shall assess a penalty equal to 20 percent of the reduction in taxes in the case of a
false application, a false certification, or in the case of a required excess-income certification that
was not filed as of the applicable due date. The commissioner shall assess a penalty equal to 50
percent of the reduction in taxes if the taxpayer knowingly filed a false application or certification,
or knowingly failed to file a required excess-income certification by the applicable due date. The
commissioner shall assess penalties under this section through the issuance of an order under the
provisions of chapter 270C. Persons affected by a commissioner's order issued under this section
may appeal as provided in chapter 270C.
    (b) The commissioner may conduct investigations related to initial applications and
excess-income certifications required under this chapter within the period ending 3-1/2 years from
the due date of the application or certification.
  Sec. 5. [290D.05] CERTIFICATION BY COMMISSIONER; CALCULATION OF TAX,
TAX RATE, AND LEVY BY COUNTY AUDITOR.
    Subdivision 1. Commissioner certification. On or before September 1 of the year of initial
application, the commissioner of revenue shall certify to the county auditor of the county in which
the property is located (1) that the property qualifies for the maximum tax amount, (2) the base year,
and (3) the property taxes payable on the property in the base year.
   Subd. 2. County auditor calculations. Each year, the county auditor shall determine the
maximum homestead property tax amount for the property under section 290D.01. This is the
amount that must be used for the notice of proposed property taxes under section 275.065,
subdivision 3.
    Subd. 3. Adjustment of tax rate and levy. (a) If requested by the taxing jurisdiction, the county
auditor may estimate the total loss of revenue to the taxing jurisdiction for taxes levied in the current
year under this chapter and adjust the tax rate accordingly. If the adjustment to the tax rate is made
under this subdivision, in the following levy year the county auditor must adjust the levy of the
taxing district to compensate for the amount of variance between the estimated and actual loss of
revenues.
    (b) If an adjustment is not made under paragraph (a), a taxing jurisdiction may increase its levy
in the following year by the amount of any revenue loss under provisions of this chapter as certified
by the county auditor.
   (c) A levy adjustment under paragraph (a) or (b) is not subject to any levy limitations.

   (1) net interest income on obligations of any authority, commission, or instrumentality of the
United States to the extent includable in taxable income for federal income tax purposes but exempt
from state income tax under the laws of the United States;
    (2) if included in federal taxable income, the amount of any overpayment of income tax to
Minnesota or to any other state, for any previous taxable year, whether the amount is received as a
refund or as a credit to another taxable year's income tax liability;
    (3) the amount paid to others, less the amount used to claim the credit allowed under section
290.0674, not to exceed $1,625 for each qualifying child in grades kindergarten to 6 and $2,500 for
each qualifying child in grades 7 to 12, for tuition, textbooks, and transportation of each qualifying
child in attending an elementary or secondary school situated in Minnesota, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Iowa, or Wisconsin, wherein a resident of this state may legally fulfill the state's

For purposes of this clause, "delayed depreciation" means the amount of the addition made by
the taxpayer under subdivision 19a, clause (7), or subdivision 19c, clause (15), in the case of a
shareholder of an S corporation, minus the positive value of any net operating loss under section
172 of the Internal Revenue Code generated for the tax year of the addition. The resulting delayed
depreciation cannot be less than zero;

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.34, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Transactions without economic substance. (a) When any person, directly or
indirectly, engages in a transaction or series of transactions without economic substance to create
a loss or to reduce taxable income or to increase credits allowed in determining Minnesota tax,
the commissioner must determine the amount of a taxpayer's taxable income or tax so as to reflect
what would have been the taxpayer's taxable income or tax but for the transaction or transactions
without economic substance causing the reduction in taxable income or tax.
   (b) A transaction has economic substance only if a taxpayer shows by clear and convincing
evidence:
    (1) the transaction changes in a meaningful way (apart from federal, state, local, and foreign tax
effects) the taxpayer's economic position; and
    (2) the taxpayer has a substantial nontax purpose for entering into a transaction and the
transaction is a reasonable means of accomplishing the substantial nontax purpose.
A transaction does not have a substantial nontax purpose if it does not have a potential for profit. A
transaction has a substantial nontax purpose when the taxpayer reasonably expects that the pretax
profit for the transaction is substantial in relation to the present value of the expected net tax benefits
that would be allowed if the transaction were respected for tax purposes, and the reasonably expected
pretax profit from the transaction exceeds the risk-free rate of return.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2007.

   (2) Payroll period. For purposes of this section the term "payroll period" means a period for
which a payment of wages is ordinarily made to the employee by the employee's employer, and the

term "miscellaneous payroll period" means a payroll period other than a daily, weekly, biweekly,
semimonthly, monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payroll period.
    (3) Employee. For purposes of this section the term "employee" means any resident individual
performing services for an employer, either within or without, or both within and without the state
of Minnesota, and every nonresident individual performing services within the state of Minnesota,
the performance of which services constitute, establish, and determine the relationship between the
parties as that of employer and employee. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "employee"
includes an officer of a corporation, and an officer, employee, or elected official of the United
States, a state, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or

an individual performs or performed any service, of whatever nature, as the employee of such
person, except that if the person for whom the individual performs or performed the services does
not have control of the payment of the wages for such services, the term "employer," except for
purposes of paragraph (1), means the person having control of the payment of such wages. As used
in the preceding sentence, the term "employer" includes any corporation, individual, estate, trust,
or organization which is exempt from taxation under section 290.05 and further includes, but is not
limited to, officers of corporations who have control, either individually or jointly with another or
others, of the payment of the wages.
    (5) Number of withholding exemptions claimed. For purposes of this section, the term

claimed in a withholding exemption certificate in effect under subdivision 5, except that if no such
certificate is in effect, the number of withholding exemptions claimed shall be considered to be
zero.

as supplanting any existing Minnesota law.

chapter 154, article 8, section 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5a. Forest trust. The commissioner, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the
members of the board, may purchase forest lands in the taconite assistance area defined in under
section 273.1341 with funds specifically authorized for the purchase. The acquired forest lands
must be held in trust for the benefit of the citizens of the taconite assistance area as the Iron Range
Miners' Memorial Forest. The forest trust lands shall be managed and developed for recreation and
economic development purposes. The board may sell forest lands purchased under this subdivision
if it finds that the sale advances the purposes of the trust. Proceeds derived from the management
or sale of the lands and from the sale of timber or removal of gravel or other minerals from
these forest lands shall be deposited into an Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest account that is
established within the state financial accounts. Funds may be expended from the account upon
approval of a majority of the members of the board to purchase, manage, administer, convey
interests in, and improve the forest lands. By majority vote of the members of the board, money in
the Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest account may be transferred into the corpus of the Douglas

    298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
     An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production and
qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives
of the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that
producer. The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each
local employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the
employee committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees.
The review must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal for
expenditure of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be released
only for acquisition of plant and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or
for research and development in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production
technology, but only if the producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same
purpose of at least 50 percent of the distribution b     ­­

mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and the producer removes the piece of equipment from the
taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134 within ten years from the date of receipt of the
money from the fund, a portion of the money granted from the fund must be repaid to the taconite
economic development fund. The portion of the money to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant
if the equipment is removed from the taconite tax relief area within 12 months after receipt of
the money from the fund, declining by ten percent for each of the subsequent nine years during
which the equipment remains within the taconite tax relief area. If a taconite production facility is
sold after operations at the facility had ceased, any money remaining in the fund for the former
producer may be released to the purchaser of the facility on the terms otherwise applicable to the
former producer under this section. If a producer fails to provide matching funds for a proposed
expenditure within six months after the commissioner approves release of the funds, the funds
are available for release to another producer in proportion to the distribution provided and under
the conditions of this section. Any portion of the fund which is not released by the commissioner
within two years of its deposit in the fund shall be divided between the taconite environmental
protection fund created in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust
fund created in section 298.292 for placement in their respective special accounts. Two-thirds
of the unreleased funds shall be distributed to the taconite environmental protection fund and
one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.24, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 8, section 5, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Imposed; calculation. (a) For concentrate produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003,
there is imposed upon taconite and iron sulphides, and upon the mining and quarrying thereof, and
upon the production of iron ore concentrate therefrom, and upon the concentrate so produced, a tax
of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced therefrom. For concentrates
produced in 2005, the tax rate is the same rate imposed for concentrates produced in 2004.
    (b) For concentrates produced in 2006 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to the
preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding
year to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. "Implicit price deflator" means the implicit price
deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United
States Department of Commerce.
    (c) On concentrates produced in 1997 and thereafter, an additional tax is imposed equal to three
cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate for each one percent that the iron content
of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
     (d) The tax shall be imposed on the average of the production for the current year and the previous
two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's tax rate. This clause shall not apply
in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property taxes on the facility would be higher
if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable.
    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
   (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
8094                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [95TH DAY

merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore from ore mined in this state, no tax is imposed under
this section. As used in this paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000
tons of direct reduced ore in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production"
is production of 50,000 tons or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is
ore that results in a product that has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of
a plant's commercial production of direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore
is 25 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial
production year, the rate is 50 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for
the fifth commercial production year, the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under
this subdivision; and for all subsequent commercial production years, the full rate is imposed.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite or iron sulfides, the
production of taconite or iron sulfides consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state
is not subject to the tax imposed by this section on taconite or iron sulfides.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before July 1, 2008.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

(d) must be allocated to qualifying school districts to be distributed, based upon the certification of
the commissioner of revenue, under paragraphs (b), (c), and (f).
   (b) (i) 3.43 cents per taxable ton must be distributed to the school districts in which the lands from
which taconite was mined or quarried were located or within which the concentrate was produced.
The distribution must be based on the apportionment formula prescribed in subdivision 2.

Districts Nos. 2142, St. Louis County, and 2154, Eveleth-Gilbert, or their successor districts.
   Revenues that are required to be distributed to more than one district shall be apportioned
according to the number of pupil units identified in section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the
second previous year.
    (c)(i) 15.72 cents per taxable ton, less any amount distributed under paragraph (e), shall be
distributed to a group of school districts comprised of those school districts which qualify as a tax
relief area under section 273.134, paragraph (b), or in which there is a qualifying municipality as
defined by section 273.134, paragraph (a), in direct proportion to school district indexes as follows:
for each school district, its pupil units determined under section 126C.05 for the prior school year
shall be multiplied by the ratio of the average adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit for school
districts receiving aid under this clause as calculated pursuant to chapters 122A, 126C, and 127A
for the school year ending prior to distribution to the adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit of the
district. Each district shall receive that portion of the distribution which its index bears to the sum
of the indices for all school districts that receive the distributions.
    (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), each school district that receives a distribution under sections
298.018; 298.23 to 298.28, exclusive of any amount received under this clause; 298.34 to 298.39;
298.391 to 298.396; 298.405; or any law imposing a tax on severed mineral values after reduction
for any portion distributed to cities and towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph
(5), that is less than the amount of its levy reduction under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, for the
second year prior to the year of the distribution shall receive a distribution equal to the difference;
the amount necessary to make this payment shall be derived from proportionate reductions in the
initial distribution to other school districts under clause (i).
    (d) Any school district described in paragraph (c) where a levy increase pursuant to section
126C.17, subdivision 9, was authorized by referendum for taxes payable in 2001, shall receive a
distribution of 21.3 cents per ton. Each district shall receive $175 times the pupil units identified in
section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the second previous year or the 1983-1984 school year,
whichever is greater, less the product of 1.8 percent times the district's taxable net tax capacity in
the second previous year.

    If the total amount provided by paragraph (d) is insufficient to make the payments herein required
then the entitlement of $175 per pupil unit shall be reduced uniformly so as not to exceed the
funds available. Any amounts received by a qualifying school district in any fiscal year pursuant
to paragraph (d) shall not be applied to reduce general education aid which the district receives
pursuant to section 126C.13 or the permissible levies of the district. Any amount remaining after
the payments provided in this paragraph shall be paid to the commissioner of Iron Range resources
and rehabilitation who shall deposit the same in the taconite environmental protection fund and the
Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund as provided in subdivision 11.
    Each district receiving money according to this paragraph shall reserve the lesser of the amount
received under this paragraph or $25 times the number of pupil units served in the district. It may
use the money for early childhood programs or for outcome-based learning programs that enhance
the academic quality of the district's curriculum. The outcome-based learning programs must be
approved by the commissioner of education.
    (e) There shall be distributed to any school district the amount which the school district was
entitled to receive under section 298.32 in 1975.
    (f) Four cents per taxable ton must be distributed to qualifying school districts according to the
distribution specified in paragraph (b), clause (ii), and two cents per taxable ton must be distributed

aggregate material is transported from the extraction site or sold, whichever occurs first. When
aggregate material is stored in a stockpile within the state of Minnesota and a public highway, road
or street is not used for transporting the aggregate material, the tax shall not be imposed until either
when the aggregate material is sold, or when it is transported from the stockpile site, or when it is
used from the stockpile, whichever occurs first.
    (b) A county that imposes the aggregate production tax under paragraph (a) shall impose upon
every importer a production tax of 21.5 cents per cubic yard or 15 cents per ton of aggregate material
imported into the county. The tax shall be imposed when the aggregate material is imported from the
extraction site or sold. When imported aggregate material is stored in a stockpile within the state of
Minnesota and a public highway, road, or street is not used for transporting the aggregate material,
the tax shall be imposed either when the aggregate material is sold, when it is transported from the
stockpile site, or when it is used from the stockpile, whichever occurs first. The tax shall be imposed
on an importer when the aggregate material is imported into the county that imposes the tax.
    (c) If the aggregate material is transported directly from the extraction site to a waterway, railway,
or another mode of transportation other than a highway, road or street, the tax imposed by this section
shall be apportioned equally between the county where the aggregate material is extracted and the
county to which the aggregate material is originally transported. If that destination is not located
in Minnesota, then the county where the aggregate material was extracted shall receive all of the
proceeds of the tax.

    For purposes of definitions of "taconite tax relief area" and "taconite assistance area" in
Minnesota Statutes, sections 273.134, 273.1341, and related laws, the elimination of the property

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.994, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Developing a set of criteria. A business subsidy may not be granted until the grantor
has adopted criteria after a public hearing for awarding business subsidies that comply with this
section. The criteria may not be adopted on a case-by-case basis. The criteria must set specific
minimum requirements that recipients must meet in order to be eligible to receive business subsidies.
The criteria must include a specific wage floor for the wages to be paid for the jobs created. The wage
floor may be stated as a specific dollar amount or may be stated as a formula that will generate a
specific dollar amount. A grantor may deviate from its criteria by documenting in writing the reason
for the deviation and attaching a copy of the document to its next annual report to the department. The
commissioner of employment and economic development may assist local government agencies in
developing criteria. A copy of the criteria must be submitted to the Department of Employment and
Economic Development along with the first annual report following the enactment of this section
or with the first annual report after it has adopted criteria, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding
section 116J.993, subdivision 3, clauses (1) and (21), for the purpose of this subdivision, "business
subsidies" as defined under section 116J.993 includes the following forms of financial assistance:

grantor must provide public notice and a hearing on the subsidy. A public hearing and notice under
this subdivision is not required if a hearing and notice on the subsidy is otherwise required by law.
    (b) Public notice of a proposed business subsidy under this subdivision by a state government
grantor, other than the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board, must be published in the
State Register. Public notice of a proposed business subsidy under this subdivision by a local
government grantor or the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board must be published in
a local newspaper of general circulation. The public notice must identify the location at which
information about the business subsidy, including a summary of the terms of the subsidy, is
available. Published notice should be sufficiently conspicuous in size and placement to distinguish
the notice from the surrounding text. The grantor must make the information available in printed
paper copies and, if possible, on the Internet. The government agency must provide at least a
ten-day notice for the public hearing.
   (c) The public notice must include the date, time, and place of the hearing.
   (d) The public hearing by a state government grantor other than the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board must be held in St. Paul.
   (e) If more than one nonstate grantor provides a business subsidy to the same recipient, the
nonstate grantors may designate one nonstate grantor to hold a single public hearing regarding the
business subsidies provided by all nonstate grantors. For the purposes of this paragraph, "nonstate
grantor" includes the iron range resources and rehabilitation board.

    (f) The public notice of any public meeting about a business subsidy agreement, including those
required by this subdivision and by subdivision 4, must include notice that a person with residence
in or the owner of taxable property in the granting jurisdiction may file a written complaint with the
grantor if the grantor fails to comply with sections 116J.993 to 116J.995, and that no action may be
filed against the grantor for the failure to comply unless a written complaint is filed.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 34. Seed capital investment credit. (a) An individual, estate, or trust is allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter for investments in a qualifying business certified under
section 116J.8732, subdivision 3. The credit equals 45 percent of the amount invested by the
taxpayer in qualified businesses during the taxable year. The credit must not exceed $112,500 for
each taxable year.
    (b) A pass-through entity that invests in a qualified business must be considered to be the
taxpayer for purposes of the investment limitations in this subdivision and the amount of the
credit allowed with respect to a pass-through entity's investment in a qualified business must
be determined at the pass-through entity level. The amount of the total credit determined at the
pass-through entity level must be allowed to the members in proportion to their respective interests
in the pass-through entity.
    (c) An investment made in a qualified business from the assets of a retirement plan is deemed
to be the retirement plan participant's investment for the purpose of this subdivision if a separate
account is maintained for the plan participant and the participant directly controls where the account
assets are invested.
    (d) The investment must be made on or after the certification effective date and must be at risk
in the business to be eligible for the tax credit under this subdivision. An investment for which a
credit is received under this subdivision must remain in the qualified business for at least three years.
Investments placed in escrow do not qualify for the credit.
    (e) The entire amount of an investment for which a credit is claimed under this subdivision must
be expended by the qualified business for plant, equipment, research and development, marketing
and sales activity, or working capital for the qualified business.
    (f) A taxpayer who owns a controlling interest in the qualified business or who receives more
than 50 percent of the taxpayer's gross annual income from the qualified business is not entitled to
a credit under this subdivision. A member of the immediate family of a taxpayer disqualified by
this subdivision is not entitled to the credit under this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision,
"immediate family" means the taxpayer's spouse, parent, sibling, or child or the spouse of any such
person.
    (g) The commissioner may disallow any credit otherwise allowed under this subdivision if any
representation by a business in the application for certification as a qualified business proves to be
false or if the taxpayer or qualified business fails to satisfy any conditions under this subdivision or
section 116J.8732 or any conditions consistent with those requirements otherwise determined by the
commissioner. The commissioner has four years after the due date of the return or after the return
was filed, whichever period expires later, to audit the credit and assess additional tax that may be
found due to failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision and section 116J.8732. The
amount of any credit disallowed by the commissioner that reduced the taxpayer's income tax liability

for any or all applicable tax years, plus penalty and interest as provided under chapter 289A, must
be paid by the taxpayer.
    (h) If the amount of the credit under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the limitations
under paragraph (a), clause (2), the excess is a credit carryover to each of the four succeeding taxable
years. The entire amount of the excess unused credit for the taxable year must be carried first to the
earliest of the taxable years to which the credit may be carried. The amount of the unused credit that
may be added under this paragraph may not exceed the taxpayer's liability for tax, less the credit for
the taxable year. Each year, the aggregate amount of seed capital investment tax credit allowed for
investments under this subdivision is limited to allocations that a border city has available for tax
reductions in border city enterprise zones under section 469.170. The city must annually notify the
commissioner of the amount of its section 469.170 allocations that it wishes to use to provide credits
under this paragraph and the commissioner, after verifying the available allocation, shall implement
the limit under this paragraph. If investments in qualified businesses reported to the commissioner
exceed the limit on credits for investments imposed by this subdivision, the credit must be allowed
to taxpayers in the chronological order of their investments in qualified businesses as determined
from the forms filed under section 116J.8732.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008, for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2007, and only applies to investments made after the qualified business has been
certified by the commissioner of employment and economic development.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 35. Renaissance zone; historic rehabilitation credit. (a) A taxpayer who incurs costs
that are eligible for a credit under section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code for the rehabilitation
of property in a renaissance zone is allowed a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter,
including the taxes under sections 290.091 and 290.0922, equal to 25 percent of the federal credit
for the taxable year. As used in this subdivision, a "renaissance zone" is the area of the campus of
the former state regional treatment center in the city of Fergus Falls, including five buildings and
associated land that were acquired by the city prior to January 1, 2007.
    (b) If the amount of the credit under this subdivision exceeds the tax liability under this chapter
for the year in which the cost is incurred, the amount that exceeds the tax liability may be carried
back to any of the three preceding taxable years or carried forward to each of the ten taxable years
succeeding the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The entire amount of the credit must
be carried to the earliest taxable year to which the amount may be carried. The unused portion of
the credit must be carried to the following taxable year.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2008.

the lesser of its market value or the value determined by capitalizing the net operating income of a
comparable apartment operated on a rental basis at the capitalization rate used in valuing comparable
buildings that are not limited equity cooperatives. If a cooperative fails to operate in accordance with
the provisions of clauses (a) to (d), the property shall be subject to additional property taxes in the
amount of the difference between the taxes determined in accordance with this subdivision for the
last ten years that the property had been assessed pursuant to this subdivision and the amount that

partnership operates the property in conjunction with a cooperative association, and has received
public financing, homestead treatment may be claimed by the cooperative association on behalf of
the members of the cooperative for each dwelling unit occupied by a member of the cooperative.
The cooperative association must provide the assessor with the Social Security numbers of those
members. To qualify for the treatment provided by this subdivision, the following conditions must
be met:
    (a) the cooperative association must be organized under chapter 308A or 308B and all voting
members of the board of directors must be resident tenants of the cooperative and must be elected
by the resident tenants of the cooperative;
    (b) the cooperative association must have a lease for occupancy of the property for a term of
at least 20 years, which permits the cooperative association, while not in default on the lease,
to participate materially in the management of the property, including material participation in
establishing budgets, setting rent levels, and hiring and supervising a management agent;
    (c) to the extent permitted under state or federal law, the cooperative association must have a
right under a written agreement with the owner to purchase the property if the owner proposes to
sell it; if the cooperative association does not purchase the property it is offered for sale, the owner
may not subsequently sell the property to another purchaser at a price lower than the price at which
it was offered for sale to the cooperative association unless the cooperative association approves the
sale;
    (d) a minimum of 40 percent of the cooperative association's members must have incomes at or
less than 60 percent of area median gross income as determined by the United States Secretary of

association and the units must be assessed as provided in subdivision 3, provided that any unit not
so occupied shall be classified and assessed pursuant to the appropriate class. No more than three
acres of land may, for assessment purposes, be included with each dwelling unit that qualifies for
homestead treatment under this subdivision.
     When dwelling units no longer qualify under this subdivision, the current owner must notify the
assessor within 60 days. Failure to notify the assessor within 60 days shall result in the loss of benefits
under this subdivision for taxes payable in the year that the failure is discovered. For these purposes,
"benefits under this subdivision" means the difference in the net tax capacity of the units which no
longer qualify as computed under this subdivision and as computed under the otherwise applicable
law, times the local tax rate applicable to the building for that taxes payable year. Upon discovery of
a failure to notify, the assessor shall inform the auditor of the difference in net tax capacity for the
building or buildings in which units no longer qualify, and the auditor shall calculate the benefits
under this subdivision. Such amount, plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of that amount, shall then
be demanded of the building's owner. The property owner may appeal the county's determination
by serving copies of a petition for review with county officials as provided in section 278.01 and
filing a proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days
of the date of the notice from the county. The appeal shall be governed by the Tax Court procedures
provided in chapter 271, for cases relating to the tax laws as defined in section 271.01, subdivision 5;
disregarding sections 273.125, subdivision 5, and 278.03, but including section 278.05, subdivision
2. If the amount of the benefits under this subdivision and penalty are not paid within 60 days, and
if no appeal has been filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of the benefit and penalty to
the succeeding year's tax list to be collected as part of the property taxes on the affected buildings.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 13, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 13, section 29, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13. Homestead application. (a) A person who meets the homestead requirements
under subdivision 1 must file a homestead application with the county assessor to initially obtain
homestead classification.
    (b) The format and contents of a uniform homestead application shall be prescribed by the
commissioner of revenue. The application must clearly inform the taxpayer that this application
must be signed by all owners who occupy the property or by the qualifying relative and returned to
the county assessor in order for the property to receive homestead treatment.
    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
8146                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [95TH DAY

    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
    The Social Security numbers, state or federal tax returns or tax return information, or affidavits
or other proofs of the property owners and spouses submitted under this or another section to support
a claim for a property tax homestead classification, and the federal income tax schedule F required
by this section, are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12, but,
notwithstanding that section, the private data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or,
for purposes of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes
owing, to the county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative
of the owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the
property to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The
Social Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property shall be
required on the homestead application filed under this subdivision. If a different relative of the
owner subsequently occupies the property, the owner of the property must notify the assessor within
30 days of the change in occupancy. The Social Security number of a relative or relative's spouse
occupying the property is private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12,
but may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for the purposes of proceeding under the
Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the county treasurer.
    (e) The homestead application shall also notify the property owners that the application filed
under this section will not be mailed annually and that if the property is granted homestead status
for any assessment year, that same property shall remain classified as homestead until the property
is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the owner, or the relatives no
longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the homestead property, a
certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided under section 272.115.
Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold, transferred, or that the
owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the property as a homestead,
shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property will lose its current
homestead status.
    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. If a homestead application
has not been filed with the county by December 15, the assessor shall classify the property as
nonhomestead for the current assessment year for taxes payable in the following year, provided
that the owner may be entitled to receive the homestead classification by proper application under
section 375.192.
    (g) At the request of the commissioner, each county must give the commissioner a list that
includes the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the

property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or a spouse of a
qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification
as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite homestead credit under section 273.135,
the residential homestead and agricultural homestead credits under section 273.1384, and the
supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.

    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
   (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the
property owner, property owner's spouse, qualifying relative of a property owner, or spouse of a
qualifying relative;
   (iii) the classification of the property under section 273.13 for taxes payable in the current year
and in the prior year;
    (iv) an indication of whether the property was classified as a homestead for taxes payable in the
current year because of occupancy by a relative of the owner or by a spouse of a relative;
   (v) the property taxes payable as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 13, for the current year
and the prior year;
   (vi) the market value of improvements to the property first assessed for tax purposes for taxes
payable in the current year;
    (vii) the assessor's estimated market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the
current year and the prior year;
    (viii) the taxable market value assigned to the property for taxes payable in the current year and
the prior year;

     (ix) whether there are delinquent property taxes owing on the homestead;
     (x) the unique taxing district in which the property is located; and
     (xi) such other information as the commissioner decides is necessary.
    The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate under the law,
including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners, under chapter
290A.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 22, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 2, section 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse; or
   (2) any person who is permanently and totally disabled or by the disabled person and the disabled
person's spouse.
   Property is classified and assessed under clause (2) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph.
    Property is classified and assessed under paragraph (b) only if the commissioner of revenue or
the county assessor certifies that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
95TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2008                                        8151

    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $50,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
     (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts public water as
defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary and seasonal residential
occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250
days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion used as a homestead
by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation
that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a member of a limited
liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held by the corporation,
partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a
commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the portion used
exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for residential
occupancy. Class 1c property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined
as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with
water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide recreational
activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or
cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide services; or
sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the property is transferred to an
individual or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for class
1c even though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property that
otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement, as
long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. The portion of the property used as
a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the property is classified
as follows: the first $600,000 of market value is tier I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier
II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.50 percent;
tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. Owners of real and personal property devoted to
temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes in which all or a portion of
the property was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250 days in the year preceding
the year of assessment desiring classification as class 1c, must submit a declaration to the assessor
designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year preceding the year of
assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a proportionate share
of the land on which they are located must be designated as class 1c as otherwise provided. The
remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they are located
must be designated as class 3a commercial. The owner of property desiring designation as class
1c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which
class 1c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding
the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3)
gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility operated
on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for
recreation purposes does not qualify for class 1c.

273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).

    Subd. 25. Class 4. (a) Class 4a is residential real estate containing four or more units and used or
held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals
licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.56, other than hospitals exempt under section 272.02, and

    (1) except as provided in subdivision 22, paragraph (c), or subdivision 23, paragraph (b),
clause (1), real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreation purposes, including real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreation purposes and not devoted to commercial purposes for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause, property
is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is used
for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property
must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,

for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property must provide recreational activities such as renting ice
fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide
marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad
offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c is also class 4c regardless of the
term of the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. In
order for a property to be classified as class 4c, seasonal residential recreational for commercial
purposes, at least 40 percent of the annual gross lodging receipts related to the property must be
from business conducted during 90 consecutive days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid
bookings by lodging guests during the year must be for periods of at least two consecutive nights;
or (ii) at least 20 percent of the annual gross receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses,
boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina
services, launch services, and guide services, or the sale of bait and fishing tackle. For purposes
of this determination, a paid booking of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings.
Class 4c also includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes
in conjunction with class 4c property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property is not devoted to
commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment
and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used. Owners of real and
personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes
and all or a portion of which was devoted to commercial purposes for not more than 250 days
in the year preceding the year of assessment desiring classification as class 4c, must submit a
declaration to the assessor designating the cabins or units occupied for 250 days or less in the year
preceding the year of assessment by January 15 of the assessment year. Those cabins or units and a
proportionate share of the land on which they are located must be designated class 4c as otherwise
provided. The remainder of the cabins or units and a proportionate share of the land on which they
are located will be designated as class 3a. The owner of property desiring designation as class
4c property must provide guest registers or other records demonstrating that the units for which
class 4c designation is sought were not occupied for more than 250 days in the year preceding
the assessment if so requested. The portion of a property operated as a (1) restaurant, (2) bar, (3)
gift shop, (4) conference center or meeting room, and (5) other nonresidential facility operated
on a commercial basis not directly related to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for
recreation purposes does not qualify for class 4c;
   (2) qualified property used as a golf course if:

   (i) it is open to the public on a daily fee basis. It may charge membership fees or dues, but a
membership fee may not be required in order to use the property for golfing, and its green fees for
golfing must be comparable to green fees typically charged by municipal courses; and
    (ii) it meets the requirements of section 273.112, subdivision 3, paragraph (d).
   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
   (3) real property up to a maximum of three acres of land owned and used by a nonprofit
community service oriented organization and that is not used for residential purposes on either a
temporary or permanent basis, qualifies for class 4c provided that it meets either of the following:
   (i) the property is not used for a revenue-producing activity for more than six days in the calendar
year preceding the year of assessment; or
   (ii) the organization makes annual charitable contributions and donations at least equal to the
property's previous year's property taxes and the property is allowed to be used for public and
community meetings or events for no charge, as appropriate to the size of the facility.
    For purposes of this clause,
    (A) "charitable contributions and donations" has the same meaning as lawful gambling purposes
under section 349.12, subdivision 25, excluding those purposes relating to the payment of taxes,
assessments, fees, auditing costs, and utility payments;
    (B) "property taxes" excludes the state general tax;
     (C) a "nonprofit community service oriented organization" means any corporation, society,
association, foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious,
fraternal, civic, or educational purposes, and which is exempt from federal income taxation

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.014, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

comply with these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization
powers to the county beginning with the following year's assessment and continuing unless the
powers are reinstated under paragraph (c).

   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276.04, subdivision 2, as amended by Laws 2008,
chapter 154, article 2, section 19, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing
authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a particular tax
statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan
special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph (i), must be separately
stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be aggregated except that any
levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake
improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for
that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey
County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under
section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county
levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax
deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the
deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections
270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar
amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of
this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar.
The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be
listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:

received under section 273.135 must be separately stated and identified as "taconite tax relief"; and
   (6) the net tax payable in the manner required in paragraph (a).
    (d) If the county uses envelopes for mailing property tax statements and if the county agrees, a
taxing district may include a notice with the property tax statement notifying taxpayers when the
taxing district will begin its budget deliberations for the current year, and encouraging taxpayers
to attend the hearings. If the county allows notices to be included in the envelope containing the
property tax statement, and if more than one taxing district relative to a given property decides to
include a notice with the tax statement, the county treasurer or auditor must coordinate the process
and may combine the information on a single announcement.

tax, including the credit payable under section 469.318, a reduction of tax is deemed to have been

credits, for any part of the year in which the business becomes subject to repayment under this
section nor for any year thereafter. Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision
64, for any taxes payable in the year following the year in which the property became subject to
repayment under this section nor for any year thereafter. A business is not eligible for any sales tax
benefits beginning with goods or services purchased or first put to a taxable use on the day that the
business becomes subject to repayment under this section.
    Subd. 5. Waiver authority. (a) The commissioner may waive all or part of a repayment required
under subdivision 1, if the commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of employment
and economic development and appropriate officials from the local government units in which
the qualified business is located, determines that requiring repayment of the tax is not in the best
interest of the state or the local government units and the business ceased operating as a result of
circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited to:
   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the
commissioner has waived repayment by the operating business under subdivision 1, unless the
person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone was a contributing
factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1.
   (2) The commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:
   (i) the person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone and the
business that operated in the zone are not related parties as defined in section 267(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31, 2007; and
    (ii) actions of the person were not a contributing factor in the qualified business becoming subject
to repayment under subdivision 1.
    Subd. 6. Reconciliation. Where this section is inconsistent with section 116J.994, subdivision
3, paragraph (e), or 6, or any other provisions of sections 116J.993 to 116J.995, this section prevails.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendment to subdivision 4, paragraph (c), of this section is
effective the day following final enactment. The amendment to subdivision 4, paragraph (f), is
effective January 1, 2008, and applies to all businesses that become subject to this section in 2008
and thereafter. The rest of this section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004, except that
for violations that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if the
business has repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 2. [469.3191] BREACH OF AGREEMENTS BY BUSINESSES THAT CONTINUE
TO OPERATE IN ZONE.
    (a) A "business in violation of its business subsidy agreement but not subject to section 469.319"
means a business that is operating in violation of the business subsidy agreement but maintains a
level of operations in the zone that does not subject it to the repayment provisions of section 469.319,

subdivision 1, clause (1).
    (b) A business described in paragraph (a) that does not sign a new or amended business subsidy
agreement, as authorized under paragraph (h), is subject to repayment of benefits under section
469.319 from the day that it ceases to perform in the zone a substantial level of activities described
in the business subsidy agreement.
    (c) A business described in paragraph (a) ceases being a qualified business after the last day that
it has to meet the goals stated in the agreement.
    (d) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable
credits, for any part of the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business under
paragraph (c), and thereafter. A business is not eligible for sales tax benefits beginning with goods
or services purchased or put to a taxable use on the day that it is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c). Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision 64, for any
taxes payable in the year following the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c), and thereafter.
     (e) A business described in paragraph (a) that wants to resume eligibility for benefits under
section 469.315 must request that the commissioner of employment and economic development
determine the length of time that the business is ineligible for benefits. The commissioner shall
determine the length of ineligibility by applying the proportionate level of performance under the
agreement to the total duration of the zone as measured from the date that the business subsidy
agreement was executed. The length of time must not be less than one full year for each tax benefit
listed in section 469.315. The commissioner of employment and economic development and the
appropriate local government officials shall consult with the commissioner of revenue to ensure
that the period of ineligibility includes at least one full year of benefits for each tax.
   (f) The length of ineligibility determined under paragraph (e) must be applied by reducing the
zone duration for the property by the duration of the ineligibility.
   (g) The zone duration of property that has been adjusted under paragraph (f) must not be altered
again to permit the business additional benefits under section 469.315.
    (h) A business described in paragraph (a) becomes eligible for benefits available under section
469.315 by entering into a new or amended business subsidy agreement with the appropriate local
government unit. The new or amended agreement must cover a period beginning from the date of
ineligibility under the original business subsidy agreement, through the zone duration determined
by the commissioner under paragraph (f). No exemption of property taxes under section 272.02,
subdivision 64, is available under the new or amended agreement for property taxes due or paid
before the date of the final execution of the new or amended agreement, but unpaid taxes due after
that date need not be paid.
   (i) A business that violates the terms of an agreement authorized under paragraph (h) is
permanently barred from seeking benefits under section 469.315 and is subject to the repayment
provisions under section 469.319 effective from the day that the business ceases to operate as a
qualified business in the zone under the second agreement.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004. For violations
that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if the business has

repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 3. [469.3192] PROHIBITION AGAINST AMENDMENTS TO BUSINESS SUBSIDY
AGREEMENT.
   Except as authorized under section 469.3191, under no circumstance shall terms of any
agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315 be
amended to change job creation, job retention, or wage goals included in the agreement.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all agreements executed before, on, or after the effective date.
  Sec. 4. [469.3193] CERTIFICATION OF CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY FOR JOBZ
BENEFITS.
    (a) By December 1 of each year, every qualified business must certify to the commissioner of
revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, whether it is in compliance with any agreement
required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315. A business that
fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those still operating in the zone, that
submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later determines materially misrepresents
the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to the repayment provisions under section
469.319 from January 1 of the year in which the report is due or the date that the business became
subject to section 469.319, whichever is earlier. Any such business is permanently barred from
obtaining benefits under section 469.315. For purposes of this section, the bar applies to an entity
and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an ownership interest of at least 20 percent
of the entity.
    (b) Before the sanctions under paragraph (a) apply to a business that fails to submit the
certification, the commissioner of revenue shall send notice to the business, demanding that the
certification be submitted within 30 days and advising the business of the consequences for failing
to do so. The commissioner of revenue shall notify the commissioner of employment and economic
development and the appropriate job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is sent to
a business under this paragraph.
   (c) The certification required under this section is public.
    (d) The commissioner of revenue shall promptly notify the commissioner of employment and
economic development of all businesses that certify that they are not in compliance with the terms
of their business subsidy agreement and all businesses that fail to file the certification.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

collection and the uncollectibility of referred debts shall be made by the commissioner who shall
then notify the commissioner of finance and the referring agency. A decision by the commissioner
that a referred debt is uncollectible does not prevent the referring agency from taking additional
collection action.
    (b) Before a debt becomes 121 days past due, a referring agency may refer the debt to the
commissioner for collection at any time after a debt becomes delinquent and uncontested and
the debtor has no further administrative appeal of the amount of the debt. When a debt owed to
a referring agency becomes 121 days past due, the referring agency must refer the debt to the
commissioner for collection. This requirement does not apply if there is a dispute over the amount
or validity of the debt, if the debt is the subject of legal action or administrative proceedings,
or the agency determines that the debtor is adhering to acceptable payment arrangements. The
commissioner may provide that certain types of debt need not be referred to the commissioner
for collection under this paragraph. Methods and procedures for referral must follow internal
guidelines prepared by the commissioner.
    (c) If the referring agency is a court, the court must furnish a debtor's Social Security number to
the commissioner when the court refers the debt.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for debts referred after December 31, 2008.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 270A.08, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
95TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 27, 2008                                       8167

    Subdivision 1. Notice to debtor. (a) Not later than five days after the claimant agency has sent
notification to the department pursuant to section 270A.07, subdivision 1, the claimant agency shall
send a written notification to the debtor asserting the right of the claimant agency to the refund or
any part thereof. If the notice is returned to the claimant agency as undeliverable, or the claimant
agency has reason to believe the debtor did not receive the notice, the claimant agency shall obtain
    cu
the ­ ­­r­
       r­en
          ­­t last known address of the debtor from the commissioner and resend the corrected notice.
    (b) If a debt has been referred to the commissioner for collection under chapter 16D, and the
referring agency meets the definition of claimant agency under this chapter, the commissioner must
notify the debtor prior to using revenue recapture under this chapter for collection of the debt. The
notice must be sent by United States mail or personal delivery to the last known address of the
debtor.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for debts referred after December 31, 2008.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 270C.33, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Prohibition against collection during appeal period of an order. No collection action
can be taken on an order of assessment, or any other order imposing a liability, including the filing
of liens under section 270C.63, and no late payment penalties may be imposed when a return has
been filed for the tax type and period upon which the order is based, during the appeal period of an
order. The appeal period of an order ends: (1) 60 days after the order has been mailed to the taxpayer
by the commissioner; (2) if an administrative appeal is filed under section 270C.35, 60 days after
determination of the administrative appeal; (3) if an appeal to Tax Court is filed under chapter 271,
when the decision of the Tax Court is made; or (4) if an appeal to Tax Court is filed and the appeal is
based upon a constitutional challenge to the tax, 60 days after final determination of the appeal. This
subdivision does not apply to a jeopardy assessment under section 270C.36, or a jeopardy collection
under section 270C.36.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
