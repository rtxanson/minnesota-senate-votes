basis for the motion. At the hearing, if the court finds prima facie evidence in support of the motion,
the court may grant the insured permission to amend the pleadings to seek an award of the remedies
under this subdivision.
    (e) An award of remedies under this subdivision must be determined by the court in a proceeding
subsequent to any determination as to whether the insured is entitled to any proceeds under the
insurance policy and is governed by the procedures set forth in Minnesota Rules of General Practice,
rule 119."

them.
    (a) "Insured" means a person who, or an entity which, qualifies as an insured under the terms of
an insurance policy on which a claim for coverage is made. An insured does not include any person
who, or entity which, has received any assignment of rights under an insurance policy, and does not
include any person or entity claiming a third-party beneficiary status under an insurance policy.
    (b) "Insurer" means every insurer, corporation, business trust, or association engaged in
insurance as principal licensed to transact insurance under section 60A.06, but for purposes of this
section an insurer does not include a political subdivision providing self-insurance or establishing
a pool under section 471.981, subdivision 3.
    (c) "Insurance policy" means a written agreement between an insured and an insurer, which
obligates an insurer to pay proceeds directly to the insured. Insurance policy does not include
provisions of a written agreement, which obligate an insurer to defend the insured, reimburse
an insured's defense expenses, provide for any other type of defense obligation, or provide for
indemnification for judgments or settlements. Insurance policy also does not include any written
agreement providing workers' compensation insurance under chapter 176, any written agreement

60A.06, subdivision 1, clauses (4) and (6).
    Subd. 2. Liability. (a) The court may award as taxable costs to an insured amounts as provided
in subdivision 3 if the insured can show:
   (1) the absence of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the insurance policy; and
    (2) that the insurer knew of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the insurance
policy or acted in reckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the
insurance policy.
   (b) The insured is not entitled to taxable costs under this section if it is determined:
   (1) the insurer did not breach the insurance policy; or
   (2) the insured is not entitled to proceeds under the insurance policy in an amount that is in
excess of an amount offered by the insurer.
    (c) A violation of this section shall not be the basis for any claim or award under chapter 325D
or 325F.
   (d) A disagreement between an insurer and an insured as to the value or amount of proceeds

the court as taxable costs for an insurer's violation of subdivision 2:
   (1) an amount not exceeding the lesser of:

   (ii) $100,000; and
    (2) reasonable attorney fees actually incurred to establish the insurer's violation of this section.

the insurer, and shall not exceed the lesser of:
   (i) one-half of the disputed amount of the proceeds sought from the insurer; or
   (ii) $40,000.

549.02; 549.04; and 549.09, and under Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 68. An insured's
request to the court for an award under sections 357.25; 549.02; 549.04; and 549.09, or Minnesota
Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 68, shall preclude the insured from an award under this section.
    (c) An insured is not entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages, or attorney fees under
section 8.31, because of any violation of this section.

this section, and must be accompanied by one or more affidavits showing the factual basis for the
motion. The motion may be opposed by the submission of one or more affidavits showing there is
no factual basis for the motion. At the hearing, if the court finds prima facie evidence in support
of the motion, the court may grant the moving party permission to amend the pleadings to claim
taxable costs under this section.
    (b) An award of taxable costs under this section shall be determined by the court in a proceeding
subsequent to any determination as to whether the insured is entitled to any proceeds under the
insurance policy, and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in Minnesota Rules of General
Practice, rule 119.

options on how decisions would be made on expenditures of possible revenues to the state under a
cap and trade program. The commissioner may contract with the University of Minnesota or other
state public institutions of higher learning or may issue a request for proposals for the study. The
report must examine:
    (1) the role of the legislature, citizens, technical experts, and state agencies in decisions on
allocating funds; and

the impacts of the following types of expenditures:
   (1) direct per capita rebates to Minnesotans;
   (2) grants and incentives to consumers to invest in energy efficiency and utilize renewable energy
sources or in other technologies, products, or practices that help Minnesotans reduce energy costs,
energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions;
   (3) financial assistance to businesses that install technologies that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, targeting energy-intensive industries facing competitors not subject to comparable
regulation, including, but not limited to, mining, pulp and paper, cement, refining, and chemicals;
   (4) investments in public infrastructure that reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
   (5) investments in worker training and retraining programs; and
   (6) incentives for terrestrial and geologic carbon sequestration.
    Subd. 4. Study criteria. The report required under subdivision 1 shall determine the extent to
which expenditures on the measures identified in subdivision 3 assist Minnesota in its transition to a
low greenhouse gas-emitting economy and increase the economic gains and reduce the dislocating
impacts of the transition. Specifically, the report shall assess the extent to which expenditures meet
the following goals:
   (1) produce cost-effective emission reductions;
   (2) increase sustainable economic development, job creation, and job growth;
   (3) reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sectors that do not participate in the cap and trade

transportation, processing, or disposal of waste, or for the installation or operation of any system or
facility, or any part thereof, related to the storage, collection, transportation, processing, or disposal
of waste.
     After July 1, 2008, the agency may issue a new permit to a new facility located in a community
that meets all of the following conditions only if the facility also meets the conditions of paragraph
(b):
     (1) is within a half mile of a site designated by the federal government as an EPA superfund site;
     (2) a majority of the population are low-income persons of color and American Indians;
   (3) a disproportionate percent of the children have childhood lead poisoning, asthma, or other
environmentally related health problems;
    (4) is located in an urban area that has experienced numerous air quality alert days of dangerous
air quality for sensitive populations between February 2007 and February 2008; and

   (5) is located near the junctions of several heavily trafficked state and county highways and two
one-way streets which carry both truck and auto traffic.
    The Pollution Control Agency may revoke or modify any permit issued under this subdivision
and section 116.081 whenever it is necessary, in the opinion of the agency, to prevent or abate
pollution.
   (b) If a new facility meets the conditions provided in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (5), then a
new permit may be issued by the Pollution Control Agency only if the new facility agrees to:
    (1) hire at least 35 percent of the facility's permanent employees from the community and
surrounding neighborhoods within which the facility will be located and target job training and
local hiring efforts to residents which meet the criteria listed in paragraph (a), clause (2);
   (2) equip all diesel trucks bringing fuel to the facility with advanced filter systems that reduce
emissions from diesel exhaust;
   (3) report, on a quarterly basis to the community within which the facility is located, actual
emissions levels, as measured by the Pollution Control Agency's 24-hour emissions testing; and
   (4) refrain from burning refuse-derived fuel, as defined by section 119.90, at the facility.
    (c) The Pollution Control Agency has the authority for approval over the siting, expansion,
or operation of a solid waste facility with regard to environmental issues. However, the agency's
issuance of a permit does not release the permittee from any liability, penalty, or duty imposed by any
applicable county ordinances. Nothing in this chapter precludes, or shall be construed to preclude,
a county from enforcing land use controls, regulations, and ordinances existing at the time of the
permit application and adopted pursuant to sections 366.10 to 366.181, 394.21 to 394.37, or 462.351
to 462.365, with regard to the siting, expansion, or operation of a solid waste facility.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

an underground tank is located and all residents and businesses within 1,000 feet of the tank within
30 days of receiving any of the following information on a tank:
   (1) the installation of a new underground storage tank system;
   (2) the discovery of an abandoned tank or of a change in the uses, contents, or ownership of a
tank under section 116.48, subdivisions 2 and 3;
   (3) reports of all releases under section 115.061, including suspected releases, spills and overfills,

within five years before July 1, 1991. As used in the subdivision, "infrastructure" means public
water facilities, storm water and sanitary sewer piping, outfalls, inlets, culverts, bridges, and any
other work defined specifically by a local government unit as constituting a capital improvement
to a parcel within the context of an approved development plan. This exemption applies only in a
greater than 80 percent area or in a watershed contiguous to a greater than 80 percent area.
  Sec. 15. [103G.2251] STATE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS; WETLAND BANK
CREDIT.
   In greater than 80 percent areas, preservation of wetlands subsequently protected by a

wetland banking credits, according to rules adopted by the board.
   Sec. 16. [103G.252] ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY ORDERS.
    The commissioner may issue an order requiring violations to be corrected and administratively
assessing monetary penalties for violations of chapters 84, 103F, and 103G, rules, orders,
agreements, settlements, licenses, registrations, or permits for activities affecting the course,
current, or cross-section of public waters, appropriation or diversion of waters of the state, or
harvest, control, or destruction of aquatic plants. The commissioner must follow the procedures in
section 103G.253 when issuing an administrative penalty order. The maximum monetary amount
of an administrative penalty order is $10,000 for each violator for all violations by that violator
identified in an inspection or review of compliance.
   Sec. 17. [103G.253] ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY ORDER PROCEDURE.
   Subdivision 1. Contents of order. An order assessing an administrative penalty under section
103G.252 must include:
   (1) a concise statement of the facts alleged to constitute a violation;
   (2) a reference to the law, rule, order, agreement, settlement, license, registration, or permit that
has been violated;
   (3) a statement of the corrective order and the amount of the administrative penalty to be imposed
and the factors upon which it is based; and
   (4) a statement of the person's right to review the order.
    Subd. 2. Amount of penalty; considerations. (a) In determining the amount or requirements
of a penalty under section 103G.252, the commissioner may consider:
   (1) the willfulness of the violation;
7762                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [92ND DAY

    (2) the gravity of the violation, including damage to humans, animals, air, water, land, forests,
or other natural resources of the state;
   (3) the history of past violations;
   (4) the number of violations;
   (5) the economic benefit gained by the person by allowing or committing the violation; and
    (6) other factors as justice may require, if the commissioner specifically identifies the additional
factors in the commissioner's order.
   (b) For a second or subsequent violation, the commissioner shall, in determining the amount or
requirements of a penalty, consider:
   (1) the factors in paragraph (a);
   (2) the similarity of the most recent previous violation and the violation to be penalized;
   (3) the time elapsed since the last violation;
   (4) the number of previous violations; and
   (5) the response of the person to the most recent previous violation identified.
    Subd. 3. Corrective order. (a) The commissioner may issue an order requiring the violations
cited in the order to be corrected within the time period specified in the order. Corrective orders
may require repair, restoration, replacement, and monetary restitution as determined by the
commissioner.
    (b) The person to whom the order was issued shall provide information to the commissioner
before the 31st day after the order was received demonstrating that the violation has been corrected
or that the person has developed a corrective plan. The commissioner shall determine whether the
violation has been corrected or whether the corrective plan is acceptable and notify the person to
whom the order was issued of the commissioner's determination.
    Subd. 4. Penalty. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), if the commissioner determines that the
violation has been corrected or the person to whom the order was issued has developed a corrective
plan acceptable to the commissioner, the monetary penalty must be forgiven.
    (b) Unless the person requests review of the order under subdivision 5 before the monetary
penalty is due, the penalty in the order is due and payable on the 31st day after the order was
received.
   (c) For repeated or serious violations, the commissioner may issue an order with a monetary
penalty that shall not be forgiven after the corrective action is taken.
   (d) Interest at the rate established in section 549.09 begins to accrue on penalties under this
subdivision on the 31st day after the order with the penalty was received.
   Subd. 5. Expedited administrative hearing. (a) Within 30 days after receiving an order, the
person to whom the order was issued may request an expedited hearing, using the procedures
adopted under section 14.51, to review the commissioner's action. The hearing request must
92ND DAY]                         TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 2008                                       7763

specifically state the reasons for seeking review of the order. The person to whom the order was
issued and the commissioner are the parties to the expedited hearing. The commissioner must
notify the person to whom the order was issued of the time and place of the hearing at least 15 days
before the hearing. The expedited hearing must be held within 30 days after a request for hearing
has been filed with the commissioner unless the parties agree to a later date.
   (b) All written arguments must be submitted within ten days following the close of the hearing.
The hearing shall be conducted according to rules adopted under section 14.51, as modified by this
subdivision. The Office of Administrative Hearings may, in consultation with the commissioner of
natural resources, adopt rules specifically applicable to cases under this section.
    (c) The administrative law judge shall issue a report making recommendations about the
commissioner's action to the commissioner within 30 days following the close of the record. The
administrative law judge may not recommend a change in the amount of the proposed penalty
or corrective order unless the administrative law judge determines that, based on the factors in
subdivision 2, the monetary penalty or corrective order is unreasonable.
   (d) If the administrative law judge makes a finding that the hearing was requested solely for
purposes of delay or that the hearing request was frivolous, the commissioner may add to the
amount of the penalty the costs charged to the Department of Natural Resources by the Office of
Administrative Hearings for the hearing.
    (e) If the administrative law judge issues a report that recommends dismissal of the order
assessing the administrative penalty, the commissioner must refund the costs charged to the person
receiving the order by the Office of Administrative Hearings for the hearing and reasonable and
necessary attorney fees incurred for the hearing. For purposes of this paragraph, the administrative
law judge may recommend attorney fees to be refunded, not to exceed the amount of the penalty
order.
    (f) If a hearing has been held, the commissioner may not issue a final order until at least five
days after receipt of the report of the administrative law judge. The person to whom the order was
issued may, within those five days, comment to the commissioner on the recommendations and the
commissioner must consider the comments. The final order may be appealed according to sections
14.63 to 14.69.
   (g) If a hearing has been held and a final order issued by the commissioner, the penalty must
be paid within 30 days after the date the final order is received and the corrective action must be
completed within the time period specified by the final order, unless review of the final order is
requested under sections 14.63 to 14.69. If review is not requested or the order is reviewed and
upheld, the amount due is the penalty, together with interest accruing from 31 days after the original
order was received at the rate established in section 549.09.
    Subd. 6. Alternative dispute resolution. In addition to review under subdivision 5, the
commissioner may enter into mediation or other alternative dispute resolution concerning an order
issued under this section if the commissioner and the person to whom the order was issued both
agree to mediation or other alternative dispute resolution.
    Subd. 7. Enforcement. (a) The attorney general may proceed on behalf of the state to enforce
penalties that are due and payable under this section in any manner provided by law for the collection
of debts.
7764                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [92ND DAY

    (b) The attorney general may petition the district court to file the administrative order as an
order of the court. At any court hearing, the only issues parties may contest are procedural and
notice issues. Once entered, the administrative order may be enforced in the same manner as a final
judgment of the district court.
   (c) If a person fails to pay the penalty or comply with a corrective order, the attorney general
may bring a civil action in district court seeking payment of the penalties, injunctive relief, or other
appropriate relief including monetary damages, attorney fees, costs, and interest.
    Subd. 8. Revocation and suspension of permit, license, or registration. If a person fails to
pay a penalty owed under this section, the commissioner may revoke or refuse to reissue or renew
a permit, license, or registration issued by the commissioner.
    Subd. 9. Cumulative remedy. The authority of the commissioner to issue a corrective order
assessing penalties is in addition to other remedies available under statutory or common law, except
that the state may not seek civil penalties under any other provision of law for the violations covered
by the administrative penalty order. The payment of a penalty does not preclude the use of other
enforcement provisions, under which penalties are not assessed, in connection with the violation
for which the penalty was assessed.
   Sec. 18. [103G.254] RECOVERY OF LITIGATION COSTS AND EXPENSES.
    In any judicial action brought by the attorney general for civil penalties, injunctive relief, or
an action to compel performance under section 103G.253, if the state ultimately prevails and if
the proven violation was willful, the state, in addition to other penalties provided by law, may be
allowed an amount determined by the court to be the reasonable value of all or part of the litigation
expenses incurred by the state. In determining the amount of the litigation expenses to be allowed,
the court shall give consideration to the economic circumstances of the defendant.
   Sec. 19. [173.0855] STAR LAKE OR RIVER SIGNS.
    Subdivision 1. Authority to erect. (a) A county, statutory or home rule charter city, or town
of Minnesota that contains a star lake or river designated under section 103B.701 may request the
Department of Transportation to erect star lake or river signs pursuant to section 161.139. One
sign may be erected at each approach to a lake or river within the right-of-way of an interstate or
other highway that passes over a lake or river in the Department of Transportation's eight-county
metropolitan district or near or over a lake or river in greater Minnesota.
    (b) An official lake or river sign on the right-of-way of an interstate or other highway may
be replaced with a star lake or river sign by the Department of Transportation pursuant to section
161.139.
    Subd. 2. Sign standards. The Department of Transportation shall design and manufacture
the star lake and river signs to specifications not contrary to other federal and state highway sign
standards.

    (d) If the county board disapproves the acquisition, it must state valid reasons. The commissioner
may not purchase or lease the land if the county board disapproves the acquisition and states its
reasons within the prescribed time period. The landowner or the commissioner may appeal the
disapproval to the district court having jurisdiction where the land is located.
    (e) The commissioner or the owner of the land may submit the proposed acquisition to the
Land Exchange Board if: (1) the county board does not give reason for disapproval, or does not
approve or disapprove the acquisition within the prescribed time period; or (2) the court finds that
the disapproval is arbitrary and capricious, or that the reasons stated for disapproval are invalid.
    (f) The Land Exchange Board must conduct a hearing and make a decision on the acquisition
within 60 days after receiving the proposal. The Land Exchange Board must give notice of the
hearing to the county board, the commissioner, the landowner, and other interested parties. The
Land Exchange Board must consider the interests of the county, the state, and the landowner in
determining whether the acquisition is in the public interest. If a majority of the Land Exchange
Board members approves the acquisition, the commissioner may acquire the land. If a majority
disapproves, the commissioner may not purchase or lease the land.
   (g) This subdivision does not apply to land acquired for the Carlos Avery and Lamprey Pass
Wildlife Management Areas that is contiguous to other land within the wildlife management area.

    (2) the licensee is unable to participate in the licensed activity because the licensee is called
to active military duty or military leave is canceled during the entire open season of the licensed
activity. The original license and a copy of the military orders or notice of cancellation of leave must
be provided to the commissioner; or
   (3) the licensee purchased two licenses for the same license season in error.

   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 97A.405, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
     Subd. 2. Personal possession. (a) A person acting under a license or traveling from an area where
a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp
validation and a valid state driver's license, state identification card, or other form of identification

provided by the commissioner, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but
the actual license has not been issued and received. A person charged with violating the license
possession requirement shall not be convicted if the person produces in court or the office of the
arresting officer, the actual license previously issued to that person, which was valid at the time
of arrest, or satisfactory proof that at the time of the arrest the person was validly licensed. Upon
request of a conservation officer or peace officer, a licensee shall write the licensee's name in the
presence of the officer to determine the identity of the licensee.
    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.
    (d) A license issued electronically and not immediately provided to the licensee shall be mailed

    (d) Except as provided in subdivision 3, a person may not at any time cast the rays of a spotlight,
headlight, or other artificial light on property posted with signs prohibiting the shining of lights
onto the property. When signs are posted, the signs shall display letters that are at least two inches
in height and state "no shining" or similar terms, and shall be placed at intervals of 500 feet or less
along the boundary of the property.
   Subd. 3. Exceptions. (a) It is not a violation of this section for a person to cast the rays of a
spotlight, headlight, or other artificial light to:
   (1) take raccoons in accordance with section 97B.621, subdivision 3, or tend traps in accordance
with section 97B.931; or
   (2) hunt fox or coyote from January 1 to March 15 while using a hand-held artificial light,
provided that the person is:
   (i) on foot;
   (ii) using a shotgun;
   (iii) not within a public road right-of-way;
   (iv) using a hand-held or electronic calling device; and
   (v) not within 200 feet of a motor vehicle.
   (b) It is not a violation of subdivision 2 for a person to cast the rays of a spotlight, headlight, or
other artificial light to:
   (1) carry out any agricultural, safety, emergency response, normal vehicle operations, or
occupational-related activities that do not involve taking wild animals; or
    (2) carry out outdoor recreation as defined in section 97B.001 that is not related to spotting,
locating, or taking a wild animal.
   Sec. 51. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97B.106, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Qualifications for crossbow permits. (a) The commissioner may issue a special
permit, without a fee, to take big game, small game, or rough fish with a crossbow to a person
that is unable to hunt or take rough fish by archery because of a permanent or temporary physical
disability. A crossbow permit issued under this section also allows the permittee to use a bow with a
mechanical device that draws, releases, or holds the bow at full draw as provided in section 97B.035,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    (b) To qualify for a crossbow permit under this section, a temporary disability must render
the person unable to hunt or fish by archery for a minimum of two years after application for the
permit is made. The permanent or temporary disability must be established by medical evidence,
and the inability to hunt or fish by archery for the required period of time must be verified in writing
by a licensed physician or chiropractor. A person who has received a special permit under this
section because of a permanent disability is eligible for subsequent special permits without providing
medical evidence and verification of the disability.
   (c) The person must obtain the appropriate license.

     Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97B.301, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Residents or nonresidents under age 18 may take deer of either sex. A resident or
nonresident under the age of 18 may take a deer of either sex except in those antlerless permit areas
and seasons where no antlerless permits are offered. In antlerless permit areas where no antlerless
permits are offered, the commissioner may provide a limited number of youth either sex permits
to residents or nonresidents under age 18, under the procedures provided in section 97B.305, and
may give preference to residents or nonresidents under the age of 18 that have not previously been

    Sec. 61. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97C.203, is amended to read:
  97C.203 EXCHANGE OF FISH OR WILDLIFE RESOURCES; DISPOSAL OF STATE
HATCHERY PRODUCTS.
    (a) The commissioner shall dispose of fish hatchery products or exchange fish or wildlife
resources only after they have been tested for certifiable diseases. The testing must have been
completed within the 12 months preceding the disposal or exchange. Fish or wildlife resources
subject to an exchange must have received a disease-free certification for those certifiable diseases
not currently documented in Minnesota. Disease certification must be provided prior to accepting
the fish or wildlife resource. When the fish or wildlife resource is not certified as disease-free, they
may be stocked or transferred only into waters that already contain that disease.
    (b) State hatchery products shall be disposed of according to the following order of priorities:
   (1) distribution of fish eggs and fry to state hatcheries to hatch fry or raise fingerlings for stocking
waters of the state for recreational fishing;
    (2) transfer to other government agencies in exchange for fish or wildlife resources of equal value
or private fish hatcheries in exchange for fish to be stocked in waters of the state for recreational
fishing;
   (3) sale to private fish hatcheries or licensed aquatic farms at a price not less than the fair
wholesale market value, established as the average price charged at the state's private hatcheries
and contiguous states per volume rates;
  (4) transfer to other government agencies, colleges, or universities for cooperative fish
management and research purposes; and
    (5) sale of not more than $25 fair market value to any school, museum, or commercial enterprise
for curriculum implementation, educational programs, public exhibition, or cooperative displays.

   97C.205 TRANSPORTING AND STOCKING FISH.
   (a) Except on the water body where taken, a person may not transport a live fish in a quantity of
water sufficient to keep the fish alive, unless the fish:
   (1) is being transported under an aquaculture license as authorized under sections 17.4985 and
17.4986;
   (2) is being transported for a fishing contest weigh-in under section 97C.081;

    (5) is being transported as otherwise authorized in this section or as prescribed for certifiable
diseases under sections 17.46 to 17.4999.
   (b) The commissioner may adopt rules to allow and regulate:
   (1) the transportation of fish and fish eggs; and
   (2) the stocking of waters with fish or fish eggs.
    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe rules designed to encourage local sporting organizations
to propagate game fish by using rearing ponds. The rules must:
   (1) prescribe methods to acquire brood stock for the ponds by seining public waters;
   (2) allow the sporting organizations to own and use seines and other necessary equipment; and
   (3) prescribe methods for stocking the fish in public waters that give priority to the needs of the
community where the fish are reared and the desires of the organization operating the rearing pond.
    (d) A person age 16 or under may, for purposes of display in a home aquarium, transport
largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass, black crappie, white crappie, bluegill
pumpkinseed, green sunfish, orange spotted sunfish, and black, yellow, and brown bullheads
taken by angling. No more than four of each species may be transported at any one time, and any
individual fish can be no longer than ten inches in total length.

of the state. For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.

all the land shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources. In an exchange of Class 2
land for Class 3 land, the value of all the land shall be determined by the county board of the county
in which the land lies. To determine the value of the land, the parties to the exchange may cause the
land to be appraised, utilize the valuation process provided under section 84.0272, subdivision 3,
or obtain a market analysis from a qualified real estate broker. Merchantable timber value must be
determined and considered in finalizing valuation of the lands.
     (b) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
utilize title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. All expedited land exchanges under this
92ND DAY]                           TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 2008                                         7801

section, and the terms and conditions of the exchanges, require the unanimous approval of the
Land Exchange Board.

executed by the commissioner of natural resources in the name of the state. Conveyance of Class
2 land given in exchange shall be by a deed executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name
of the state. Conveyance of Class 3 land shall be by a deed executed by the governing body in the
name of the governing authority.
   (b) If Class 1 land is given in exchange for Class 2 or 3 land, the deed to the Class 2 or 3 land
shall first be delivered to the commissioner of natural resources. Following the recording of the
deed, the commissioner of natural resources shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 1 land.
    (c) If Class 2 land is given in exchange for Class 3 land, the deed to the Class 3 land shall first be
delivered to the county auditor. Following the recording of the deed, the commissioner of revenue
shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 2 land.
   (d) All deeds shall be recorded or registered in the county in which the lands lie.
    Subd. 7. Reversionary interest; mineral and water power rights and other reservations. (a)
All deeds conveying land given in an expedited land exchange under this section shall include a
reverter that provides that title to the land automatically reverts to the conveying governmental unit
if:
   (1) the receiving governmental unit sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers title of the land
within 40 years of the date of the deed conveying ownership; and
   (2) there is no prior written approval for the transfer from the conveying governmental unit. The
authority for granting approval is the commissioner of natural resources for former Class 1 land, the
county board for former Class 2 land, and the governing body for former Class 3 land.
    (b) Class 1 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section 94.343,
subdivision 4. Class 2 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section
94.344, subdivision 4. County fee land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of
section 373.01, subdivision 1, paragraph (g).
    Subd. 8. Land status. Land received in exchange for Class 1 land is subject to the same trust,
if any, and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange
for Class 2 land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision wherein it lies and all
laws relating to tax-forfeited land. Land received in exchange for Class 3 land has the same status
as the land given in exchange.
