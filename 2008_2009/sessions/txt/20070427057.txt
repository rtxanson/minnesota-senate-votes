   The governing body of the municipality may also require that other parties, including the
municipality, but excluding the park owner or its purchaser, involved in the park closing provide
additional compensation to residents to mitigate the adverse financial impact of the park closing
upon the residents.
    At the public hearing, the municipality shall appoint a third-party neutral, to be agreed upon
by both the manufactured home park owner and manufactured home owners, whose hourly cost
must be reasonable and paid from the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. The
third-party neutral shall act as a paymaster and arbitrator, with decision-making authority to resolve
any questions or disputes regarding any contributions or disbursements to and from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund by either the manufactured home park owner or the
manufactured home owners. If the parties cannot agree on a third party, the municipality will make
a determination.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. (a) If
a manufactured home owner is required to move due to the conversion of all or a portion of a
manufactured home park to another use, the closure of a park, or cessation of use of the land as
a manufactured home park, the manufactured park owner shall, upon such change in use, pay
to the commissioner of finance for deposit in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust
fund under section 462A.40, the lesser amount of the actual costs of moving or purchasing the
manufactured home approved by the third-party neutral and paid by the Minnesota Housing Finance
Agency under subdivision 13, paragraph (a) or (e), or $3,250 for each single section manufactured
home, and $6,000 for each multisection manufactured home, for which a manufactured home
owner has made application for payment of relocation costs under subdivision 13, paragraph
(c). The manufactured home park owner shall make payments required under this section to the
Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund within 60 days of receipt from the third-party
neutral.
   (b) A manufactured home park owner is not required to make the payment prescribed under
paragraph (a), nor is a manufactured home owner entitled to compensation under subdivision 13,
paragraph (a) or (e), if:
    (1) the manufactured home park owner relocates the manufactured home owner to another space
in the manufactured home park or to another manufactured home park at the park owner's expense;
   (2) the manufactured home owner is vacating the premises and has informed the manufactured
home park owner or manager of this prior to the mailing date of the closure statement under
subdivision 1;
    (3) a manufactured home owner has abandoned the manufactured home, or the manufactured
home owner is not current on the monthly lot rental, personal property taxes, or has failed to pay
the annual $12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund when due;
   (4) the manufactured home owner has a pending eviction action for nonpayment of lot rental
amount under section 327C.09, which was filed against the manufactured home owner prior to the

by the district court;
    (5) the conversion of all or a portion of a manufactured home park to another use, the closure
of a park, or cessation of use of the land as a manufactured home park is the result of a taking or
exercise of the power of eminent domain by a governmental entity or public utility; or
    (6) the owner of the manufactured home is not a resident of the manufactured home park, as
defined in section 327C.01, subdivision 9, or the owner of the manufactured home is a resident, but
came to reside in the manufactured home park after the mailing date of the closure statement under
subdivision 1.
    (c) Owners of manufactured homes who rent lots in a manufactured home park shall make annual
payments to the park owner, to be deposited in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust
fund under section 462A.40, in the amount of $12 per year, per manufactured home, payable on
August 15 of each year. On or before July 15 of each year, the commissioner of finance shall prepare
and forward to the park owner for circulation to its residents, a generic invoice and cover letter
explaining the purpose of the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund, the obligation
of each manufactured home owner to make an annual $12 payment into the fund, the due date,
and the need to pay to the park owner for collection, and a warning, in 14-point font, that if the
annual payments are not made when due, the manufactured home owner will not be eligible for
compensation from the fund if the manufactured home community closes. The park owner shall
receive, record, and commingle the payments and forward the payments to the commissioner of
finance by September 15 of each year, with a summary by the park owner, certifying the name,
address, and payment amount of each remitter, and noting the names and address of manufactured
home owners who did not pay the $12 annual payment. The commissioner of finance shall deposit
the payments in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund.
    (d) This subdivision and subdivision 13, paragraph (c), clause (5), are enforceable by the
third-party neutral, on behalf of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, or by action in a court
of appropriate jurisdiction.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 13. Change in use, relocation expenses; payments by park owner. (a) If a manufactured
home owner is required to relocate due to the conversion of all or a portion of a manufactured
home park to another use, the closure of a manufactured home park, or cessation of use of the land
as a manufactured home park under subdivision 1, and the manufactured home owner complies
with the requirements of this section, the manufactured home owner is entitled to payment from
the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund equal to the manufactured home owner's
actual relocation costs for relocating the manufactured home to a new location within a 25-mile
radius of the park that is being closed, up to a maximum of $4,000 for a single-section and $8,000
for a multisection manufactured home. The actual relocation costs must include the reasonable cost
of taking down, moving, and setting up the manufactured home, including equipment rental, utility
connection and disconnection charges, minor repairs, modifications necessary for transportation of
the home, necessary moving permits and insurance, moving costs for any appurtenances, which
meet applicable local, state, and federal building and construction codes.
   (b) A manufactured home owner is not entitled to compensation under paragraph (a) if the
manufactured home park owner is not required to make a payment to the Minnesota manufactured
home relocation trust fund under subdivision 12, paragraph (b).

    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e), in order to obtain payment from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, the manufactured home owner shall submit to the
third-party neutral and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, with a copy to the park owner, an
application for payment, which includes:
   (1) a copy of the closure statement under subdivision 1;
   (2) a copy of the contract with a moving or towing contractor, which includes the relocation
costs for relocating the manufactured home;
   (3) a statement with supporting materials of any additional relocation costs as outlined in
subdivision 1;
   (4) a statement certifying that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under
subdivision 12, paragraph (b), apply to the manufactured home owner;
    (5) a statement from the manufactured park owner that the lot rental is current and that the annual
$12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been paid when due;
and
   (6) a statement from the county where the manufactured home is located certifying that personal
property taxes for the manufactured home are paid through the end of that year.
    (d) If the third-party neutral does not approve or deny payment within 45 days after receipt of
the information set forth in paragraph (c), the payment is deemed approved. Upon approval and
request by the third-party neutral, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall issue two checks
in equal amount for 50 percent of the contract price payable to the mover and towing contractor for
relocating the manufactured home in the amount of the actual relocation cost, plus a check to the
home owner for additional certified costs associated with third-party vendors, that were necessary
in relocating the manufactured home. The moving or towing contractor shall receive 50 percent
upon execution of the contract and 50 percent upon completion of the relocation and approval by
the manufactured home owner. The moving or towing contractor may not apply the funds to any
other purpose other than relocation of the manufactured home as provided in the contract. A copy
of the approval must be forwarded by the third-party neutral to the park owner with an invoice for
payment of the amount specified in subdivision 12, paragraph (a).
    (e) In lieu of collecting a relocation payment from the Minnesota manufactured home relocation
trust fund under paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner may collect an amount from the fund
after reasonable efforts to relocate the manufactured home have failed due to the age or condition of
the manufactured home, or because there are no manufactured home parks willing or able to accept
the manufactured home within a 25-mile radius. A manufactured home owner may tender title of
the manufactured home in the manufactured home park to the manufactured home park owner, and
collect an amount to be determined by an independent appraisal. The appraiser must be agreed to
by both the manufactured home park owner and the manufactured home owner. The amount that
may be reimbursed under the fund is a maximum of $5,000 for a single-section, and $9,000 for a
multisection manufactured home. The manufactured home owner shall deliver to the manufactured
home park owner the current certificate of title to the manufactured home duly endorsed by the
owner of record, and valid releases of all liens shown on the certificate of title, and a statement from
the county where the manufactured home is located evidencing that the personal property taxes have
been paid. The manufactured home owner's application for funds under this paragraph must include

a document certifying that the manufactured home cannot be relocated, that the lot rental is current,
that the annual $12 payments to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund have been
paid when due, that the manufactured home owner has chosen to tender title under this section,
and that the park owner agrees to make a payment to the commissioner of finance in the amount
established in subdivision 12, paragraph (a), less any documented costs submitted to the third-party
neutral, required for demolition and removal of the home, and any debris or refuse left on the lot,
not to exceed $1,000. The manufactured home owner must also provide a copy of the certificate
of title endorsed by the owner of record, and certify to the third-party neutral, with a copy to the
park owner, that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under subdivision 12, paragraph
(b), clauses (1) to (6), apply to the manufactured home owner, and that the home owner will vacate
the home within 60 days after receipt of payment or the date of park closure, whichever is earlier,
provided that the monthly lot rent is kept current.
    (f) The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency must make a determination of the amount of
payment a manufactured home owner would have been entitled to under a local ordinance in
effect on the effective date of this section. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the manufactured home
owner's compensation for relocation costs from the fund under section 462A.40, is the greater of
the amount provided under this subdivision, or the amount under the local ordinance in effect on
the effective date of this section, that is applicable to the manufactured home owner.
    (g) Neither the third-party neutral nor the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall be liable to
any person for recovery if the funds in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund are
insufficient to pay the amounts claimed. In such an event, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency
shall keep a record of the time and date of its approval of payment to a claimant. If sufficient funds
become available, the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency shall pay the manufactured home owner
whose unpaid claim is the earliest by time and date of approval.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Payment adjustment for smaller manufactured home parks. The total contribution
to the fund under section 462A.40 paid by the park owner under subdivision 12, paragraph (a), must
not exceed 20 percent of the sale price, or if no sale price is available, the assessed value of the
manufactured home park, except that if the sale price, or, if there is no sale price, the assessed value,
is:
   (1) less than $100,000, the manufactured home park owner's contribution to the fund must not
exceed five percent of the sale price of the manufactured home park;
    (2) less than $200,000, the owner's contribution to the fund must not exceed eight percent of the
sale price of the manufactured home park;

  Sec. 12. [114E.10] NATURE OF RIGHTS; ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY;
SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS.
    (a) Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property subject to the
environmental convenant, the environmental agency, or any other political subdivision or unit of
local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder.
The interest of a holder is an interest in real property. The holder is the grantee of the real property
interest conveyed under an environmental covenant.
    (b) Unless an environmental agency is a holder, any right that the agency may have with respect
to an environmental covenant does not constitute an interest in real property. Approval of an
environmental covenant does not make the environmental agency a holder unless it has authority
under law other than this chapter to acquire an interest in real property for purposes related to
an environmental response project and it is expressly identified as a holder in the environmental
covenant.
   (c) An environmental agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental
57TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, APRIL 27, 2007                                      2557

covenant, but an environmental agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an
environmental covenant. As provided in section 114E.15, an environmental covenant is not valid
unless signed by the environmental agency and the environmental agency may set reasonable
conditions for its approval of an environmental covenant. When the environmental agency is a
federal agency, the covenant must also be approved and signed by the state environmental agency
that has authority under state law to address the release or threatened release involved in the
environmental response project. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound
by the obligations the person expressly assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does
not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter
except as provided in the covenant.
   (d) The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an
environmental covenant is created or amended:
   (1) an interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant
unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant;
    (2) this chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest
to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant;
    (3) a subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant or in a separate
record that is recorded. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a
common interest community, the environmental covenant or the subordination agreement may be
signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association; and
    (4) an agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects
the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the
person with respect to the environmental covenant.
   Sec. 13. [114E.15] CONTENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANT.
   (a) An environmental covenant must:
    (1) state on its first page that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed pursuant to
this chapter;
   (2) contain a legally sufficient description of the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) describe the activity and use limitations on the real property;
   (4) identify every holder;
    (5) be signed and acknowledged by the environmental agency, every holder, and every owner
of the fee simple title to the real property subject to the covenant; and
   (6) identify the name and location of any administrative record for the environmental response
project reflected in the environmental covenant.
    (b) In addition to the information required by paragraph (a), an environmental covenant may
contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by the persons who signed it,
including any:
2558                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [57TH DAY

   (1) requirements for notice of any transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed
changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the
contamination or the environmental response project on, the real property subject to the covenant;
      (2) requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant;
   (3) rights of access to the real property granted in connection with implementation or
enforcement of the covenant;
    (4) a brief narrative description of the contamination and environmental response project,
including the contaminants of concern, the pathways of exposure, limits on exposure, and the
location and extent of the contamination;
    (5) limitation on amendment or termination of the covenant in addition to those contained in
sections 114E.40 and 114E.45;
      (6) rights of the holder in addition to its right to enforce the covenant pursuant to section 114E.50;
and
    (7) waiver of a party's right to consent to the amendment or termination of a covenant under
section 114E.45, paragraph (a), clause (3).
   (c) The environmental agency may set reasonable conditions for its approval of an environmental
covenant, including:
    (1) requiring that persons specified by the agency that have interests in the real property also
sign the covenant;
   (2) requiring that a person who holds a prior interest in the real property subject to the covenant
agree to subordinate that interest where applicable; and
   (3) requiring the inclusion within the text of the covenant information, restrictions, or
requirements as described in paragraph (b).
      Sec. 14. [114E.20] VALIDITY; EFFECT ON OTHER INSTRUMENTS.
      (a) An environmental covenant created under this chapter runs with the land.
      (b) An environmental covenant that is otherwise effective is valid and enforceable even if:
      (1) it is not appurtenant to an interest in real property;
      (2) it can be or has been assigned to a person other than the original holder;
      (3) it is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law;
      (4) it imposes a negative burden;
    (5) it imposes an affirmative obligation on a person having an interest in the real property or on
the holder;
      (6) the benefit or burden does not touch or concern real property;
      (7) there is no privity of estate or contract;
57TH DAY]                            FRIDAY, APRIL 27, 2007                                      2559

   (8) the holder dies, ceases to exist, resigns, or is replaced; or
   (9) the owner of an interest in the real property subject to the environmental covenant and the
holder are the same person.
    (c) Any instrument that imposes activity and use limitations, including any conservation
easement, declaration, restrictive covenant, or similar instrument created before the effective date
of this chapter remains valid and enforceable as provided in the law under which it was created.
This chapter does not apply in any other respect to such an instrument.
    (d) This chapter does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whether designated as
an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable under the law of this state.
   Sec. 15. [114E.25] RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAND USE LAW.
    (a) This chapter does not authorize a use of real property that is otherwise prohibited by zoning,
by law other than this chapter regulating use of real property, or by a recorded instrument that has
priority over the environmental covenant.
   (b) An environmental covenant may prohibit or restrict uses of real property which are authorized
by zoning or by law other than this chapter.
    (c) An environmental agency that exercises authority under law other than this chapter to require
as part of an environmental response project the performance of a response or corrective action
that would not otherwise be an authorized use of real property under zoning or other real property
law or prior recorded instruments may include such requirement as an affirmative obligation in an
environmental covenant.
   Sec. 16. [114E.30] NOTICE.
  (a) A copy of an environmental covenant, and any amendments or notices of termination thereof,
must be provided by the persons and in the manner required by the environmental agency to:
   (1) each person that signed the covenant or their successor or assign;
   (2) each person holding a recorded interest in the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) each person in possession of the real property subject to the covenant;
   (4) each political subdivision in which real property subject to the covenant is located; and
   (5) any other person the environmental agency requires.
   (b) The validity of a covenant is not affected by failure to provide a copy of the covenant as
required under this section.
   Sec. 17. [114E.35] RECORDING.
   (a) An environmental covenant and any amendment or termination of the covenant must be
recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, as applicable, in every county in which any
portion of the real property subject to the covenant is located. For purposes of indexing, a holder
shall be treated as a grantee.
   (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 114E.40, paragraph (f), an environmental covenant
2560                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [57TH DAY

is subject to the laws of this state governing recording and priority of interests in real property.
  Sec. 18. [114E.40] DURATION; MODIFICATION                               OR     TERMINATION           BY
ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT ACTION.
      (a) An environmental covenant is perpetual unless it is:
      (1) by its terms, limited to a specific duration or terminated by the occurrence of a specific event;
      (2) terminated by consent pursuant to section 114E.45;
      (3) terminated pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e);
      (4) terminated by foreclosure of an interest that has priority over the environmental covenant; or
      (5) terminated or modified in an eminent domain proceeding, but only if:
      (i) the environmental agency that signed the covenant is a party to the proceeding;
      (ii) all persons identified in paragraph (c) are given notice of the pendency of the proceeding;
and
   (iii) the court determines, after hearing, that the activity and use limitations subject to termination
or modification are no longer required to protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (b) The environmental agency that approved an environmental covenant may determine whether
to terminate or reduce the burden on the real property of the covenant if the agency determines that
some or all of the activity and use limitations under the covenant are no longer required to protect
public health or welfare or the environment or modify the covenant if the agency determines that
modification is required to adequately protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (c) The environmental agency shall provide notice of any proposed action under paragraph (b)
to each person with a current recorded interest in the real property subject to the environmental
covenant, each holder, all other persons who originally signed the environmental covenant, or their
successors or assigns, and any other person with rights or obligations under the covenant. The
environmental agency shall provide 30 days for comment on the proposed action by parties entitled
to notice. Any person entitled to notice under this paragraph may request a contested case under
chapter 14 by making the request in writing within the 30-day comment period. A determination by
an environmental agency under this paragraph is a final agency decision subject to judicial review
in the same manner as provided in sections 14.63 to 14.68 or under applicable federal law.
    (d) Any person entitled to notice under paragraph (c) may apply in writing to the environmental
agency for a determination under paragraph (b) that an existing covenant be terminated, that the
burden of a covenant be reduced, or that the covenant be modified. The application must specify
the determination sought by the applicant, the reasons why the environmental agency should make
the determination, and the information which would support it. If the environmental agency fails
to commence a proceeding under paragraph (b) within 60 days of receipt of the application, the
applicant may bring a de novo action in the district court for termination, reduction of burden, or
modification of the environmental covenant pursuant to paragraph (e).
   (e) The district court for the county in which the real property subject to an environmental
covenant is located may, under the doctrine of changed circumstances, terminate the covenant,

reduce its burden on the real property, or modify its terms in a de novo action if an environmental
agency fails to commence a proceeding within 60 days as provided under paragraph (d). The
applicant under paragraph (d), any party to the environmental covenant, or any other person
identified in paragraph (c) may commence an action under this paragraph. The person commencing
the action shall serve notice of the action on the environmental agency and any person entitled
to notice under paragraph (c). The court shall terminate, reduce the burden of, or modify the
environmental covenant if the court determines that the person bringing the action shows that some
or all of the activity and use limitations under the covenant do not, or are no longer required to,
protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (f) An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired through issuance of
a tax deed, foreclosure of a tax lien, or application of the doctrine of adverse possession, prescription,
abandonment, waiver, lack of enforcement, or acquiescence, or a similar doctrine.
    (g) An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired by application of
section 500.20 or 541.023.
   Sec. 19. [114E.45] AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION BY CONSENT.
    (a) An environmental covenant may be amended or terminated by consent only if the amendment
or termination is signed by:
   (1) the environmental agency;
   (2) the current owner of the fee simple title to the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) every other original signatory to the covenant, or their successor or assign, unless:
   (i) the person waived the right to consent to termination or modification in the environmental
covenant or another signed and acknowledged record that is recorded;
    (ii) the person fails to object to the amendment or termination within 60 days after a notice
requesting the person's consent to amendment or termination was mailed by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the person's last known address, as obtained from the United States Postal
Service; or
   (iii) a court finds that the person no longer exists or cannot be located or identified with the
exercise of reasonable diligence; and
   (4) each holder, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d).
Any person may establish that the notice described in clause (3), item (ii), was properly mailed by
recording an affidavit to that effect from a person having knowledge of the facts, and a certified
copy of the recorded affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
    (b) If an interest in real property is subject to an environmental covenant, the interest is not
affected by an amendment of the covenant unless the current owner of the interest consents to the
amendment or has waived in the environmental covenant or other signed record the right to consent
to amendments.
   (c) Except for an assignment undertaken pursuant to a governmental reorganization, or as
otherwise provided in the environmental covenant, assignment of an environmental covenant to
2562                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [57TH DAY

a new holder is an amendment.
       (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) or in an environmental covenant:
       (1) a holder may not assign its interest without consent of the other parties specified in paragraph
(a);
   (2) a holder may be removed and replaced by agreement of the other parties specified in
paragraph (a); and
       (3) a court of competent jurisdiction may fill a vacancy in the position of holder.
       Sec. 20. [114E.50] ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANT.
   (a) A civil action for injunctive or other equitable relief for violation of an environmental
covenant may be maintained by:
       (1) a party to the covenant, including all holders;
       (2) the environmental agency that signed the covenant;
       (3) any person to whom the covenant expressly grants power to enforce;
    (4) a person whose interest in the real property or whose collateral or liability may be affected
by the alleged violation of the covenant; or
       (5) a political subdivision in which the real property subject to the covenant is located.
    (b) The state environmental agency that signed the covenant may use any remedy or enforcement
measure provided in section 115.071, subdivisions 3 to 5, or 116.072 to remedy violations of a
covenant. This paragraph does not limit the state environmental agency from taking action to enforce
the terms of a covenant against a person required to comply with the covenant in connection with that
person's obligation to perform response actions or as a condition of receiving a liability assurance
with respect to a release or threatened release of contaminants.
   (c) This chapter does not limit the regulatory authority of the environmental agency under law
other than this chapter with respect to an environmental response project.
    (d) A person is not responsible for or subject to liability arising from a release or threatened
release of contamination into the environment, or for remediation costs attendant thereto, solely
because it has signed, holds rights to, or otherwise has the right to enforce an environmental
covenant.
       Sec. 21. [114E.60] UNIFORMITY OF APPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION.
    In applying and construing this chapter, consideration must be given to the need to promote
uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.
  Sec. 22. [114E.65] RELATION TO ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN GLOBAL AND
NATIONAL COMMERCE ACT.
   This chapter modifies, limits, or supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, United States Code, title 15, section 7001 et seq., but does not modify,

     Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 115.072, is amended to read:
     115.072 RECOVERY OF LITIGATION COSTS AND EXPENSES.
    In any action brought by the attorney general, in the name of the state, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter and chapters 114C, 114E, and 116, for civil penalties, injunctive relief, or in an action
to compel compliance, if the state shall finally prevail, and if the proven violation was willful, the
state, in addition to other penalties provided in this chapter, may be allowed an amount determined

acquire an interest in real property by purchase or donation. The provisions of chapter 117 govern
condemnation proceedings by the agency under this subdivision. A donation of an interest in real
property to the agency is not effective until the agency executes a certificate of acceptance. The
state is not liable under this chapter solely as a result of acquiring an interest in real property under
this subdivision. Agency approval of an environmental convenant under chapter 114E is sufficient
evidence of acceptance of an interest in real property where the agency is expressly identified as a
holder in the covenant."
     Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
     Amend the title accordingly
     The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.

    "(d) For purposes of this subdivision, "domestic partner" means one adult who has entered into
a committed interdependent relationship with another adult where the partners:
      (1) are responsible for each other's basic common welfare;
      (2) share a common residence and intend to do so indefinitely;
      (3) are not related by blood or adoption to an extent that would prohibit marriage in this state;
and
      (4) are legally competent and qualified to enter into a contract.
    For purposes of clause (2), domestic partners may share a common residence, even if they do not
each have a legal right to possess the residence or one or both domestic partners possess additional
real property. If one domestic partner temporarily leaves the common residence with the intention
to return, the domestic partners continue to share a common residence for the purposes of this
subdivision. The patient or the patient's family may also identify an adult as a domestic partner
regardless of whether the criteria in this paragraph are satisfied.
    "Patient" includes a person who meets the definition in subdivision 2, regardless of how long the
person has been admitted to a facility, and includes a person who is being transported to an acute
care inpatient facility by an emergency medical or ambulance service or who is receiving diagnosis
or treatment in an emergency admissions portion of a facility."

    The board of a district may issue general obligation certificates of indebtedness or capital notes
subject to the district debt limits to: (a) purchase vehicles, computers, telephone systems, cable
equipment, photocopy and office equipment, technological equipment for instruction, and other
capital equipment having an expected useful life at least as long as the terms of the certificates
or notes; (b) purchase computer hardware and software, without regard to its expected useful life,
whether bundled with machinery or equipment or unbundled, together with application development
services and training related to the use of the computer; and (c) prepay special assessments. The
certificates or notes must be payable in not more than fi­v
                                                          ­­e ten years and must be issued on the terms
and in the manner determined by the board, except that certificates or notes issued to prepay special
assessments must be payable in not more than 20 years. The certificates or notes may be issued
by resolution and without the requirement for an election. The certificates or notes are general
obligation bonds for purposes of section 126C.55. A tax levy must be made for the payment of
the principal and interest on the certificates or notes, in accordance with section 475.61, as in the
case of bonds. The sum of the tax levies under this section and section 123B.62 for each year must
not exceed the lesser of the amount of the district's total operating capital revenue or the sum of
the district's levy in the general and community service funds excluding the adjustments under this
section for the year preceding the year the initial debt service levies are certified. The district's
general fund levy for each year must be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of the tax levies
for debt service certified for each year for payment of the principal and interest on the certificates
or notes issued under this section as required by section 475.61, (2) the amount of the tax levies
for debt service certified for each year for payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued
under section 123B.62, and (3) any excess amount in the debt redemption fund used to retire bonds,
certificates, or notes issued under this section or section 123B.62 after April 1, 1997, other than
amounts used to pay capitalized interest. If the district's general fund levy is less than the amount
of the reduction, the balance shall be deducted first from the district's community service fund levy,
and next from the district's general fund or community service fund levies for the following year. A
district using an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the certificates or notes shall
report the amount used for this purpose to the commissioner by July 15 of the following fiscal year.
A district having an outstanding capital loan under section 126C.69 or an outstanding debt service
loan under section 126C.68 must not use an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the
certificates or notes.

    Subdivision 1. Petition. A petition signed by at least 50 percent of the property owners in the
part of the town proposed for the subordinate service district may be submitted to the town board
requesting the establishment of a subordinate service district to provide a service that the town is
otherwise authorized by law to provide. The petition must include the territorial boundaries of the
proposed district and specify the kinds of services to be provided within the district.
    Subd. 1a. Creation by town board. The town board may establish a subordinate service district
in a portion of the town by adoption of a resolution, subject to the requirements of subdivision 2.
    Subd. 2. Public hearing. Upon receipt of the petition, and the verification of the signatures by
the town clerk or prior to adoption of the resolution specified in subdivision 1a, the town board shall,
within 30 days following verification or prior to adoption of the resolution specified in subdivision
1a, hold a public hearing on the question of whether or not the requested district shall be established.
The notice of public hearing must specify the special services to be provided within the subordinate

of the district may contain amendments or modifications of the district's boundaries or functions as
set forth in the petition or the resolution specified in subdivision 1a.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 365A.08, is amended to read:

a subordinate service district the town board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for
the operation of the district including either a property tax levied only on property of the users of
the service within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the
service within the district, or a combination of a property tax and a service charge on the users of
the service.
    (b) A tax or service charge or a combination of them may be imposed to finance a function
or service in the district that the town ordinarily provides throughout the town only to the extent
that there is an increase in the level of the function or service provided in the service district over

that provided throughout the town. In that case, in addition to the townwide tax levy, an amount
necessary to pay for the increase in the level of the function or service may be imposed in the district.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. At any time after the requirements of section 356A.06 have been met and the
subordinate service district created, the town board may issue obligations in an amount it deems
necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making
capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special
services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations are
payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1,
net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter 429. The town
board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the town to ensure payment
of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service charges are
insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance with chapter
475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not included in
determining the net indebtedness of the town under the provisions of any law limiting indebtedness.
    Subd. 3. Covenants to secure obligations. In resolutions authorizing the issuance of general
or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the town board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the town as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the town will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations, and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 365A.095, is amended to read:
   365A.095 PETITION FOR REMOVAL OF DISTRICT; PROCEDURE.
    Subdivision 1. Petition. A petition signed by at least 75 percent of the property owners in the
territory of the subordinate service district requesting the removal of the district may be presented
to the town board. Within 30 days after the town board receives the petition, the town clerk shall
determine the validity of the signatures on the petition. If the requisite number of signatures are
certified as valid, the town board must hold a public hearing on the petitioned matter. Within 30
days after the end of the hearing, the town board must decide whether to discontinue the subordinate
service district, continue as it is, or take some other action with respect to it.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. If obligations have been issued for the benefit of the subordinate service district,
the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, shall continue until the obligations and any obligations
issued to refund them have been paid in full.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 373.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Capital notes. (a) A county board may, by resolution and without referendum, issue

be payable in not more than ten years and shall be issued on terms and in a manner the board
determines. A tax levy shall be made for payment of the principal and interest on the notes, in

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 375B.09, is amended to read:
   375B.09 FINANCING.
    Subdivision 1. Budget. (a) Upon adoption of the next annual budget following the creation of a
subordinate service district the county board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for
the operation of the district including, as appropriate, either a property tax levied only on property
within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the service
within the district, or any combination of a property tax and a service charge.
    (b) A tax or service charge or a combination thereof shall not be imposed to finance a function
or service in the subordinate service district which the county generally provides throughout the
county unless an increase in the level of the service is to be supplied in the subordinate service
district in which case, in addition to the countywide tax levy, only an amount necessary to pay for
the increased level of service may be imposed.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. At any time after the requirements of section 375B.07 have been met and the
subordinate service district created, the county board may issue obligations in an amount it deems
necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making
capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special
services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations
shall be payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed pursuant to
subdivision 1, net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter
429. The county board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the county to
ensure payment of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service
charges are insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance
with chapter 475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not
included in determining the net indebtedness of the county under the provisions of any law limiting
indebtedness.
    Subd. 3. Covenants to secure obligations. In resolutions authorizing the issuance of general
or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the county board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the county as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the county will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.
   Subd. 4. Continuance in the event of withdrawal. If obligations have been issued for the benefit

of the subordinate service district, and the district is withdrawn or removed pursuant to either section
375B.10 or 375B.11, the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, in the withdrawn or removed district
must continue until the obligations and any obligations issued to refund them have been paid in full.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 383B.117, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Equipment acquisition; capital notes. The board may, by resolution and without
public referendum, issue capital notes within existing debt limits for the purpose of purchasing
ambulance and other medical equipment, road construction or maintenance equipment, public
safety equipment and other capital equipment having an expected useful life at least equal to the
term of the notes issued. The notes shall be payable in not more than fi  ­v
                                                                           ­­e ten years and shall
be issued on terms and in a manner as the board determines. The total principal amount of the
notes issued for any fiscal year shall not exceed one percent of the total annual budget for that
year and shall be issued solely for the purchases authorized in this subdivision. A tax levy shall
be made for the payment of the principal and interest on such notes as in the case of bonds. For
purposes of this subdivision, "equipment" includes computer hardware and software, whether
bundled with machinery or equipment or unbundled. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
"medical equipment" includes computer hardware and software and other intellectual property for
use in medical diagnosis, medical procedures, research, record keeping, billing, and other hospital
applications, together with application development services and training related to the use of the
computer hardware and software and other intellectual property, all without regard to their useful
life. For purposes of determining the amount of capital notes which the county may issue in any
year, the budget of the county and Hennepin Healthcare System, Inc. shall be combined and the
notes issuable under this subdivision shall be in addition to obligations issuable under section
373.01, subdivision 3.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 410.32, is amended to read:
   410.32 CITIES MAY ISSUE CAPITAL NOTES FOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT.
    (a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision of other law or charter, a home rule charter city
may, by resolution and without public referendum, issue capital notes subject to the city debt limit
to purchase capital equipment.
   (b) For purposes of this section, "capital equipment" means:
   (1) public safety equipment, ambulance and other medical equipment, road construction and
maintenance equipment, and other capital equipment; and
   (2) computer hardware and software, whether bundled with machinery or equipment or
unbundled.
    (c) The equipment or software must have an expected useful life at least as long as the term of
the notes. T

    Subdivision 1. Authorization; establishment. A political subdivision or other public entity that

after their termination of service may establish a trust to pay those benefits. For purposes of this
section, the term "postemployment benefits" means benefits giving rise to a liability under Statement
No. 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and the term "trust" means a trust, a trust
account, or a custodial account or contract authorized under section 401(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
   Subd. 2. Purpose of trust. The trust established under this section may only be used to pay
postemployment benefits and may be either revocable or irrevocable.
   Subd. 3. Trust administrator. The trust administrator of a trust established under this section
shall be either:
   (1) the Public Employees Retirement Association;
   (2) a bank or banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any state
and authorized by the laws under which it is organized to exercise corporate trust powers; or
    (3) an insurance company or agency qualified to do business in Minnesota which has at least
five years' experience in investment products and services for group retirement benefits and which
has a specialized department dedicated to services for retirement investment products.
   A political subdivision or public entity may, in its discretion and in compliance with any
applicable trust document, change trust administrators and transfer trust assets accordingly.
    Subd. 4. Account maintenance. A political subdivision or other public entity may establish
a trust account to be held under the supervision of the trust administrator for the purposes of this
section. A trust administrator shall establish a separate account for each participating political
subdivision or public entity. The trust administrator may charge participating political subdivisions
and public entities fees for reasonable administrative costs. A trust administrator may establish
other reasonable terms and conditions for creation and maintenance of these accounts. The trust
administrator must report to the political subdivision or other public entity on the investment
returns of invested trust assets and on all investment fees or costs incurred by the trust. The
annual rates of return, along with investment and administrative fees and costs for the trust, must
be disclosed in the political subdivision's or public entity's annual financial audit in a manner

for which it is trust administrator to the State Board of Investment for investment created under
section 11A.14, subject to the policies and procedures established by the State Board of Investment.

public entity.
    (c) A trust administrator, other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, must ensure
that all money in the trust accounts for which it is trust administrator is invested by a registered
investment adviser, a bank investment trust department or an insurance company or agency
retirement investment department. Investment earnings must be credited to the trust account of the

individual political subdivision or public entity.
    (d) For trust assets invested by the State Board of Investment, the investment restrictions shall
be the same as those generally applicable to the State Board of Investment. For trust assets invested
by a trust administrator other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, the assets may
only be invested in investments authorized under chapter 118A or section 356A.06, subdivision 7,
in the manner specified in the applicable trust document.
   (e) A political subdivision or public entity may provide investment direction to a trust
administrator in compliance with any applicable trust document.
    Subd. 6. Limit on deposit. A political subdivision or public entity may not deposit money in a
trust or trust account created pursuant to this section if the total amount invested by that political
subdivision or public entity would exceed the political subdivision's or public entity's actuarially
determined liabilities for postemployment benefits due to officers and employees, as determined
under the applicable standards of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.
    Subd. 7. Withdrawal of funds and termination of account. (a) For a revocable account,
a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw some or all of its money or terminate the
trust account. Money and accrued investment earnings withdrawn from a revocable account must
be deposited in a fund separate and distinct from any other funds of the political subdivision
or public entity. This money, with accrued investment earnings, must be used to pay legally
enforceable postemployment benefits to former officers and employees, unless (i) there has been a
change in state or federal law affecting that political subdivision's or public entity's liabilities for
postemployment benefits, or (ii) there has been a change in the demographic composition of that
political subdivision's or public entity's employees eligible for postemployment benefits, or (iii)
there has been a change in the provisions or terms of the postemployment benefits in that political
subdivision or public entity including, but not limited to, the portion of the costs eligible employees
must pay to receive the benefits, or (iv) other factors exist that have a material effect on that political
subdivision's or public entity's actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, in
which event any amount in excess of 100 percent of that political subdivision's or public entity's
actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, as determined under standards of
the Government Accounting Standards Board, may be withdrawn and used for any purpose.
   (b) For an irrevocable account, a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw money
only:
    (1) as needed to pay postemployment benefits owed to former officers and employees of the
political subdivision or public entity; or
    (2) when all postemployment benefit liability owed to former officers or employees of the
political subdivision or public entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.
    (c) A political subdivision or public entity requesting withdrawal of money from an account
created under this section must do so at a time and in the manner required by the executive director
of the Public Employees Retirement Association or specified in an applicable trust document. The
political subdivision or public entity that created the trust must ensure that withdrawals comply with
the requirements of this section.
   (d) The legislature may not divert funds in these trusts or trust accounts for use for another
