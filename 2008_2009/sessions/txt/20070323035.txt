    Subd. 2. Duties of contracting agency. (a) Before an agency may seek approval of a professional
or technical services contract valued in excess of $5,000, it must provide the following:
   (1) a description of how the proposed contract or amendment is necessary and reasonable to
advance the statutory mission of the agency;
    (2) a description of the agency's plan to notify firms or individuals who may be available to
perform the services called for in the solicitation; and
   (3) a description of the performance measures or other tools that will be used to monitor and
evaluate contract performance.
    (b) In addition to paragraph (a), the agency must certify that:
   (1) no current state employee is able and available to perform the services called for by the
contract;
    (2) the normal competitive bidding mechanisms will not provide for adequate performance of
the services;
    (3) reasonable efforts will be made to publicize the availability of the contract to the public;
    (4) the agency will develop and implement a written plan providing for the assignment of specific
agency personnel to manage the contract, including a monitoring and liaison function, the periodic
review of interim reports or other indications of past performance, and the ultimate utilization of
the final product of the services;
   (5) the agency will not allow the contractor to begin work before the contract is fully executed
unless an exception under section 16C.05, subdivision 2a, has been granted by the commissioner
and funds are fully encumbered;
   (6) the contract will not establish an employment relationship between the state or the agency
and any persons performing under the contract; ­an

   (7) in the event the results of the contract work will be carried out or continued by state employees
upon completion of the contract, the contractor is required to include state employees in development
and training, to the extent necessary to ensure that after completion of the contract, state employees
can perform any ongoing work related to the same function; and
   (8) the agency will not contract out its previously eliminated jobs for four years without first
considering the same former employees who are on the seniority unit layoff list who meet the
minimum qualifications determined by the agency.
     (c) A contract establishes an employment relationship for purposes of paragraph (b), clause (6),
if, under federal laws governing the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor,
a person would be considered an employee."

     201.12 PROPER REGISTRATION; VERIFICATION BY MAIL; CHALLENGES.
   Subdivision 1. Notice of registration. To prevent fraudulent voting and to eliminate excess
names, the county auditor may mail to any registered voter a notice stating the voter's name and
address as they appear in the registration files. The notice shall request the voter to notify the county
auditor if there is any mistake in the information.

permanent forwarding address in this state, the county auditor shall notify the auditor of the county
where the voter resides. Upon receipt of the notice, the county auditor shall update the voter's address
in the statewide voter registration system and mail to the voter the notice of registration required by
section 201.121, subdivision 2. The notice must advise the voter that the voter's voting address has
been changed and that the voter must notify the county auditor within 21 days if the new address is
not what the voter intended to be their permanent address.
    Subd. 3. Moved out of state. If the notice is returned as undeliverable but with a permanent
forwarding address outside this state, the county auditor shall promptly mail to the voter at the
forwarding address a notice advising the voter that the voter's voter registration in this state will be
deleted unless the voter notifies the county auditor within 21 days that the voter intends to retain the
former address as the voter's permanent address. If the notice is not received by the deadline, the
county auditor shall delete the registration.

is returned as undeliverable but with no forwarding address, the county auditor shall change the
registrant's status to "challenged" in the statewide registration system. An individual challenged
in accordance with this subdivision shall comply with the provisions of section 204C.12, before
being allowed to vote. If a notice mailed at least 60 days after the return of the first nonforwardable
mailing is also returned by the postal service, the county auditor shall change the registrant's status
to "inactive" in the statewide registration system.

    Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
     Subd. 1b. Term of license; fee; premarital education. (a) The local registrar shall examine
upon oath the party applying for a license relative to the legality of the contemplated marriage. If at
the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal impediment to it, including
the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue the license, containing the
full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state of residence, with the county
seal attached, and make a record of the date of issuance. The license shall be valid for a period of
six months. In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of
the county in which the application is made, may authorize the license to be issued at any time
before the expiration of the five days. Except as provided in paragraph (b), the local registrar shall
collect from the applicant a fee of ­  $1

filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics the
reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period of
six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) The marriage license fee for parties who have completed at least 12 hours of premarital
education is $
             ­3
              ­0­ $40. In order to qualify for the reduced license fee, the parties must submit at
the time of applying for the marriage license a signed and dated statement from the person who
provided the premarital education confirming that it was received. The premarital education must
be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's designee, a person authorized to
solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized to practice marriage and family
therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use of a premarital inventory and
the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.

must be in the following form:
    "I, (name of educator), confirm that (names of both parties) received at least 12 hours
of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory and the teaching of
communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained minister, a person
authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a person licensed
to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (d) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
    (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been
filed under section 259.13; or
    (2) provides a certified copy of the court order granting it. The parties seeking the marriage
license shall have the right to choose to have the license granted without the name change or to
delay its granting pending further action on the name change request.

   "Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 297A.815, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Motor vehicle lease price; payment. (a) In the case of a lease of a motor vehicle
as provided in section 297A.61, subdivision 4, paragraph (k), clause (2), the tax is imposed on
the total amount to be paid by the lessee under the lease agreement, together with the document
administration fee or documentary fee under section 53C.01, subdivision 2. The lessor shall collect
the tax in full at the time the lease is executed or, if the tax is included in the lease and the lease is
assigned, the tax is due from the original lessor at the time the lease is assigned. The total amount
to be paid by the lessee under the lease agreement equals the agreed-upon value of the vehicle less
manufacturer's rebates, the stated residual value of the leased vehicle, and the total value allowed
for a vehicle owned by the lessee taken in trade by the lessor, plus the price of any taxable goods
and services included in the lease and the rent charge as provided by Code of Federal Regulations,
title 12, section 213.4, excluding any rent charge related to the capitalization of the tax.
    (b) If the total amount paid by the lessee for use of the leased vehicle includes amounts that
are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the tax is imposed and must be collected by the
lessor at the time the amounts are paid by the lessee. In the case of a lease which by its terms may
be renewed, the sales tax is due and payable on the total amount to be paid during the initial term
of the lease, and then for each subsequent renewal period on the total amount to be paid during the
renewal period.
    (c) If a lease is canceled or rescinded on or before 90 days of its execution or if a vehicle is
returned to the manufacturer under section 325F.665, the lessor may file a claim for a refund of the
total tax paid minus the amount of tax due for the period the vehicle is used by the lessee.
     (d) If a lessee's obligation to make payments on a lease is canceled more than 90 days after
its execution, a credit is allowed against sales tax or motor vehicles sales tax due on a subsequent
lease or purchase of a motor vehicle if that lease or purchase is consummated within 30 days of
the date the prior lease was canceled. The amount of the credit is equal to (1) the sales tax paid at
the inception of the lease, multiplied by (2) the ratio of the number of full months remaining in the
lease at the time of termination compared to the term of the lease used in calculating sales tax paid
at the inception of the lease. The credit or any part of it cannot be assigned or transferred to another
person."

purchase of the remainder portion.

operating account in the special revenue fund as specified in section 299A.705.

the commissioner of public safety. The operator's permit may be issued to any person who has
attained the age of 15 years and who has passed the examination prescribed by the commissioner.
The instruction permit may be issued to any person who has attained the age of 15 years and
