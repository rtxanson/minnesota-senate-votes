offer world languages courses and programs;
    (2) collaborate with Minnesota world languages professionals and charter schools and school
districts and continuously seek their advice in developing all aspects of world languages programs;
    (3) survey Minnesota charter schools and school districts to (i) determine the types of existing
world languages programs including, among others, those that use information technology to
provide high-quality world languages instruction, (ii) identify exemplary model world languages
programs, and (iii) identify and address staff development needs of current world languages
teachers, preservice teachers, and teacher preparation programs;
   (4) identify successful world languages programs in other states;
    (5) consult with interested stakeholders to prepare a report for the commissioner of education

assessing the feasibility and structure of a statewide world languages graduation requirement under
Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.021, subdivision 1; and
    (6) beginning February 1, 2008, and until February 1, 2012, report annually to the education
policy and finance committees of the legislature on the status of world languages in Minnesota
and the programmatic needs identified by charter school and school district surveys, and make
recommendations on how to address the identified needs.
    (b) After carefully examining existing world languages assessments, including among other
considerations the ease or difficulty with which the assessments may be adapted to world languages
not currently assessed, the commissioner, by July 1, 2009, shall recommend an assessment tool for
charter schools and school districts to use in measuring student progress in acquiring proficiency in
world languages.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2008, the department shall assist world languages teachers and other school
staff in developing and implementing world languages programs that acknowledge and reinforce the
language proficiency and cultural awareness that non-English language speakers already possess,
and encourage students' proficiency in multiple world languages. Programs under this paragraph
must encompass indigenous American Indian languages and cultures, among other world languages
and cultures. The department shall consult with postsecondary institutions in developing related
professional development opportunities.

   "Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 80A.65, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2007,
chapter 57, article 3, section 35, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Registration or notice filing fee. (a) There shall be a filing fee of $100 for every
application for registration or notice filing. There shall be an additional fee of one-tenth of one
percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to be offered in this
state, and the maximum combined fees shall not exceed $300.
    (b) When an application for registration is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective
stop order is entered under section 80A.54, all but the $100 filing fee shall be returned. If an

application to register securities is denied, the total of all fees received shall be retained.
      (c) Where a filing is made in connection with a federal covered security under section 18(b)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, there is a fee of $100 for every initial filing. If the filing is made
in connection with redeemable securities issued by an open end management company or unit
investment trust, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, there is an additional annual
fee of 1/20 of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to
be offered in this state during the notice filing period. The fee must be paid at the time of the initial
filing and thereafter in connection with each renewal no later than July 1 of each year and must
be sufficient to cover the shares the issuer expects to sell in this state over the next 12 months. If
during a current notice filing the issuer determines it is likely to sell shares in excess of the shares
for which fees have been paid to the administrator, the issuer shall submit an amended notice
filing to the administrator under section 80A.50, together with a fee of 1/20 of one percent of the
maximum aggregate offering price of the additional shares. Shares for which a fee has been paid,
but which have not been sold at the time of expiration of the notice filing, may not be sold unless
an additional fee to cover the shares has been paid to the administrator as provided in this section
and section 80A.50. If the filing is made in connection with redeemable securities issued by such a
company or trust, there is no maximum fee for securities filings made according to this paragraph.
If the filing is made in connection with any other federal covered security under Section 18(b)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, there is an additional fee of one-tenth of one percent of the maximum
aggregate offering price at which the securities are to be offered in this state, and the combined fees
shall not exceed $300. B                     ­­ eg­­n

section 327A.05, which accrues during the ninth or tenth year after the warranty date, as defined in
section 327A.01, subdivision 8, an action may be brought within two years of the discovery of the
breach, but in no event may an action under section 327A.05 be brought more than 12 years after
