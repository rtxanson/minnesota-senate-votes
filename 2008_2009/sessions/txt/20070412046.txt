resorts; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103F.205, subdivision 1; proposing coding for
new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 103F.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103F.205, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Applicability. The definitions in this section apply to sections 103F.201 to
1

        ญญ
         1 103F.227.
   Sec. 2. [103F.227] SHORELAND DEVELOPMENT; EXISTING RESORTS.
    Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies statewide and preempts local ordinances
that are inconsistent with its terms, but does not preempt local ordinances that provide additional
protection of shoreland.
    Subd. 2. Resort defined. For purposes of this section, "resort" means a shoreland commercial
establishment, existing on or before August 1, 2007, that includes buildings, lodges, structures,
dwelling units, camping or recreational vehicle sites, or enclosures, or any part thereof kept, used,
maintained, or advertised as or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations
are furnished to the public, primarily to persons seeking recreation, for periods of one day or longer,
and having for rent three or more cabins, rooms, campsites, or enclosures. A shoreland commercial
establishment must be primarily service oriented for transient lodging of guests. All cabins, rooms,
dwelling units, camping or recreational vehicle sites, or enclosures must be included in the resort
rental business. Resorts must not allow residential use of a dwelling unit or site, except dwellings
used as residences for the service providers. To qualify as a resort under this section, a resort must
be fully licensed and permitted under appropriate state and local regulations. The entire parcel of
land must be controlled and managed by the licensee.
    Subd. 3. Maintenance and replacement. (a) So long as the establishment continues to operate
as a resort, a county or municipality must allow a resort owner to:
    (1) maintain structures, including the replacement of aging or outdated components or systems
of the structure, while not increasing the structure's footprint on the land; and
   (2) replace structures damaged or lost to fire or natural disaster.
   (b) Paragraph (a), clause (2), applies only when an application for a building permit is made
within 180 days of the damage or loss.

    Subd. 4. Expansion. A county or municipality must allow a resort owner to increase a structure
footprint to minimally meet federal, state, or local dwelling standards or codes. To "minimally meet"
the standards or codes means that the replacement structure does not add new architectural elements,
such as more bedrooms, that did not exist in the original structure. Structural expansion under this
subdivision must not result in the structure being any larger than required to meet standards or codes
or the structure or any portion thereof being any closer to the shoreline than prior to the expansion.
   Subd. 5. Change in ownership. A change in ownership of a resort shall not be construed as a
conversion to a different use so long as the new owner continues to use the property as a resort."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on State and Local
Government Operations and Oversight. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

   Senator Chaudhary from the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, to which
was re-referred

that incorporates into a city to continue receiving certain payments; amending Minnesota Statutes
2006, section 97A.061, subdivision 2.
      Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
      Page 1, line 19, delete "incorporated" and insert "incorporates"
      Page 1, line 21, delete "governing body of the" and after "city" insert "council"
    Page 1, line 22, after "prohibits" insert "the discharge of firearms or" and delete "city" and insert
"state land for which the payment is received"

manner or denied any right or privilege, including, but not limited to, civil penalty or disciplinary
action by the Board of Medical Practice or by another business, occupational, or professional
licensing board or entity, solely for providing written certifications or otherwise stating that, in the

store or maintain the patient's supply of medical marijuana, that caregivers or the hospice agencies
serving their residents are not responsible for providing the marijuana for qualifying patients, that
marijuana be consumed in a method other than smoking, and that medical marijuana be consumed
only in a place specified by the facility. Nothing contained herein, however, shall require such
facilities to adopt such restrictions and no facility shall unreasonably limit a qualifying patient's
access to or use of marijuana.

of a registered organization who has been convicted of a drug felony. The department, without
disclosing the actual results of the national records check, shall notify the registered organization
in writing of the purpose for denying the registry identification card. However, the department
may grant the person a registry identification card if the commissioner determines that the person's
conviction was for the medical use of marijuana or assisting with the medical use of marijuana.
    (e) If a registered organization has employed an agent, board member, or employee and is notified
that the person failed the background check, it shall terminate the person's status as an agent, board
member, or employee within 24 hours of receiving written notification. The result of the criminal
background check is private information, and the registered organization may not disclose it, except
to defend itself of any charges related to employment law.
    (f) No person who has been convicted of a drug felony may be the agent, board member,
or employee of a registered organization. Notwithstanding this provision, if the commissioner
determines that the person's conviction was for the medical use of marijuana or assisting with
the medical use of marijuana, the commissioner may permit the person to be an agent, board
member, or employee of a registered organization. A person who is employed by, an agent of, or a
board member of a registered organization in violation of this section is guilty of a civil violation
punishable by a fine of up to $1,000. A subsequent violation of this section is a gross misdemeanor.
   (g) No registered organization may knowingly and willfully allow a person who has been
convicted of a drug felony to be its agent, board member, or employee unless the department has
granted the person a registry identification card because the person's conviction was for the medical
use of marijuana. A violation is punishable by a fine of up to $2,000.
    Subd. 8. Penalty. (a) The registered organization may not possess an amount of marijuana
that exceeds the total of the allowable amounts of marijuana for the registered qualifying patients
for whom the organization is a registered primary caregiver. The registered organization may not
dispense, deliver, or otherwise transfer marijuana to a person other than a qualifying patient or the
patient's primary caregiver. An intentional violation of this subdivision is a felony punishable by
imprisonment for not more than two years or by payment of a fine of not more than $3,000, or
both. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties applicable in law.
    (b) A person convicted of violating paragraph (a) may not continue to be affiliated with the
registered organization and is disqualified from further participation under sections 152.22 to

or removed from the premises. This investigative hold remains in effect for 90 days from the date
of initial notification, or until it is canceled or a seizure order is issued, whichever comes first.
  (b) If an item is identified as stolen or evidence in a criminal case, the law enforcement official
may:
   (1) physically seize and remove it from the dealer, pursuant to a written order from the law
enforcement official; or
   (2) place the item on hold or extend the hold as provided in this section and leave it in the shop.

the dealer, and shall provide the dealer the name and telephone number of the seizing agency and
investigator, and the case number related to the seizure.
   (d) A dealer may request seized property be returned in accordance with section 626.04.

authority, and privileges which, prior to the enactment of Laws 1909, chapter 201, were conferred
by law upon the public examiner, and shall take over all duties in relation to state banks, savings
banks, trust companies, savings associations, and other financial institutions within the state which,
prior to the enactment of chapter 201, were imposed upon the public examiner. The commissioner of
commerce shall exercise a constant supervision, either personally or through the examiners herein
provided for, over the books and affairs of all state banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings
associations, credit unions, industrial loan and thrift companies, and other financial institutions
doing business within this state; and shall, through examiners, examine each financial institution at
least once every 24 calendar months. In satisfying this examination requirement, the commissioner
may accept reports of examination prepared by a federal agency having comparable supervisory
powers and examination procedures. With the exception of industrial loan and thrift companies
which do not have deposit liabilities and licensed regulated lenders, it shall be the principal purpose
of these examinations to inspect and verify the assets and liabilities of each and so far investigate the
character and value of the assets of each institution as to determine with reasonable certainty that
the values are correctly carried on its books. Assets and liabilities shall be verified in accordance
with methods of procedure which the commissioner may determine to be adequate to carry out the
intentions of this section. It shall be the further purpose of these examinations to assess the adequacy
of capital protection and the capacity of the institution to meet usual and reasonably anticipated
deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments without resorting to excessive borrowing or sale
of assets at a significant loss, and to investigate each institution's compliance with applicable laws
and rules. Based on the examination findings, the commissioner shall make a determination as to
whether the institution is being operated in a safe and sound manner. None of the above provisions
limits the commissioner in making additional examinations as deemed necessary or advisable. The
commissioner shall investigate the methods of operation and conduct of these institutions and their
systems of accounting, to ascertain whether these methods and systems are in accordance with
law and sound banking principles. The commissioner may make requirements as to records as
deemed necessary to facilitate the carrying out of the commissioner's duties and to properly protect
the public interest. The commissioner may examine, or cause to be examined by these examiners,
on oath, any officer, director, trustee, owner, agent, clerk, customer, or depositor of any financial
institution touching the affairs and business thereof, and may issue, or cause to be issued by the
examiners, subpoenas, and administer, or cause to be administered by the examiners, oaths. In case
of any refusal to obey any subpoena issued under the commissioner's direction, the refusal may at
once be reported to the district court of the district in which the bank or other financial institution
is located, and this court shall enforce obedience to these subpoenas in the manner provided by
law for enforcing obedience to subpoenas of the court. In all matters relating to official duties,
the commissioner of commerce has the power possessed by courts of law to issue subpoenas and
cause them to be served and enforced, and all officers, directors, trustees, and employees of state
banks, savings banks, trust companies, savings associations, and other financial institutions within
the state, and all persons having dealings with or knowledge of the affairs or methods of these
institutions, shall afford reasonable facilities for these examinations, make returns and reports to the
commissioner of commerce as the commissioner may require; attend and answer, under oath, the
commissioner's lawful inquiries; produce and exhibit any books, accounts, documents, and property
as the commissioner may desire to inspect, and in all things aid the commissioner in the performance
of duties.

    Every state bank, savings bank, trust company, savings association, debt management services
provider, and other financial institutions shall be at all times under the supervision and subject to
the control of the commissioner of commerce. If, and whenever in the performance of duties, the
commissioner finds it necessary to make a special investigation of any financial institution under the
commissioner's supervision, and other than a complete examination, the commissioner shall make
a charge therefor to include only the necessary costs thereof. Such a fee shall be payable to the
commissioner on the commissioner's making a request for payment.

registration issued under this chapter, or may levy a civil penalty under section 45.027, or any
combination of actions, if the debt management services provider or any controlling or affiliated

initial registration or renew an existing registration. Revocation of or refusal to renew a registration
must be upon notice and hearing as prescribed in the Administrative Procedure Act, sections 14.57
to 14.69. The notice must set a time for hearing before the commissioner not less than 20 nor more
than 30 days after service of the notice, provided the registrant may waive the 20-day minimum. The
commissioner may, in the notice, suspend the registration for a period not to exceed 60 days. Unless
2000                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [46TH DAY

the notice states that the registration is suspended, pending the determination of the main issue,
the registrant may continue to transact business until the final decision of the commissioner. If the

within ten days of a request by the registrant. If the commissioner fails to do so, the suspension shall
terminate and be of no force or effect.
    Subd. 2. Notification of interested persons. After the notice and hearing required in subdivision

the commissioner may notify all individuals who have contracts with the affected registrant and all
creditors who have agreed to a debt management services plan that the registration has been revoked
and that the order is subject to appeal.
    Subd. 3. Receiver for funds of sanctioned registrant. When an order is issued revoking

business, such books, accounts, and records, including electronic records, as will enable the
commissioner to determine whether the registrant is complying with this chapter and of the rules,
orders, and directives adopted by the commissioner under this chapter. Every registrant must
preserve such books, accounts, and records for at least six years after making the final entry on
any transaction recorded therein. Examinations of the books, records, and method of operations
conducted under the supervision of the commissioner shall be done at the cost of the registrant.
The cost must be assessed as determined under section 46.131.
    Subd. 2. Statements to debtors. Each registrant must maintain and must make available records

and expenses to substantiate that the plan of payment is feasible and practicable.
   Sec. 18. [332A.13] FEES, PAYMENTS, AND CONSENT OF CREDITORS.
    Subdivision 1. Origination fee. The registrant may charge a nonrefundable origination fee of
not more than $50, which may be retained by the registrant from the initial amount paid by the
debtor to the registrant.
   Subd. 2. Monthly maintenance fee. The registrant may charge a periodic fee for account
maintenance or other purposes, but only if the fee is reasonable for the services provided and does
exceed the lesser of 15 percent of the monthly payment amount or $75.
    Subd. 3. Additional fees unauthorized. A registrant may not impose any fee or other charge or
receive any funds or other payment other than the initial fee or monthly maintenance fee authorized
by this section.
    Subd. 4. Amount of periodic payments retained. The registrant may retain as payment for
the fees authorized by this section no more than 15 percent of any periodic payment made to the
registrant by the debtor. The remaining 85 percent must be disbursed to listed creditors under and
in accordance with the debt management services agreement. No fees or charges may be received
or retained by the registrant for any handling of recurring payments. Recurring payments include
current rent, mortgage, utility, telephone, maintenance as defined in section 518.27, child support,
insurance premiums, and such other payments as the commissioner may by rule prescribe.
    Subd. 5. Advance payments. No fees or charges may be received or retained for any payments
by the debtor made more than the following number of days in advance of the date specified in the
debt management services agreement on which they are due: (1) 42 days in the case of contracts
requiring monthly payments; (2) 15 days in the case of agreements requiring biweekly payments; or
(3) seven days in the case of agreements requiring weekly payments. For those agreements which do
not require payments in specified amounts, a payment is deemed an advance payment to the extent
it exceeds twice the average regular payment previously made by the debtor under that contract.
This subdivision does not apply when the debtor intends to use the advance payments to satisfy
future payment of obligations due within 30 days under the contract. This subdivision supersedes
any inconsistent provision of this chapter.
   Subd. 6. Consent of creditors. A registrant must actively seek to obtain the consent of all
creditors to the debt management services plan set forth in the debt management services agreement.
Consent by a creditor may be express and in writing, or may be evidenced by acceptance of a
payment made under the debt management services plan set forth in the contract. The registrant
must notify the debtor within ten days after any failure to obtain the required consent and of the
debtor's right to cancel without penalty. The notice must be in a form as the commissioner shall
prescribe. Nothing contained in this section is deemed to require the return of any origination fee
and any fees earned by the registrant prior to cancellation or default.
    Subd. 7. Withdrawal of creditor. Whenever a creditor withdraws from a debt management
services plan, or refuses to participate in a debt management services plan, the registrant must
promptly notify the debtor of the withdrawal or refusal. In no case may this notice be provided
more than 15 days after the debt management services plan learns of the creditor's decision to
withdraw from or refuse to participate in a plan. This notice must include the identity of the creditor
withdrawing from the plan, the amount of the monthly payment to that creditor, and the right of the

debtor to cancel the agreement under section 332A.11.
    Subd. 8. Payments held in trust. The registrant must maintain a separate trust account and
deposit in the account all payments received from the moment that they are received, except that
the registrant may commingle the payment with the registrant's own property or funds, but only to
the extent necessary to ensure the maintenance of a minimum balance if the financial institution
at which the trust account is held requires a minimum balance to avoid the assessment of fees or
penalties for failure to maintain a minimum balance. All disbursements, whether to the debtor or to
the creditors of the debtor, or to the registrant, must be made from such account.
    Subd. 9. Timely payment of creditors. The registrant must disburse any funds paid by or on
behalf of a debtor to creditors of the consumer within 42 days after receipt of the funds, or earlier
if necessary to comply with the due date in the contract between the debtor and the creditor, unless
the reasonable payment of one or more of the debtor's obligations requires that the funds be held
for a longer period so as to accumulate a sum certain, or where the debtor's payment is returned for
insufficient funds or other reason that makes the withholding of such payments in the net interest of
the debtor.
   Sec. 19. [332A.14] PROHIBITIONS.

with any contract or agreement involved in the debt management services plan;
