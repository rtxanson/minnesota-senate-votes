costs from Minnesota ratepayers is not sought through any other mechanism;
    (3) allows recovery of other expenses incurred that are directly related to a renewable
energy project, including expenses for energy storage, provided that the utility demonstrates
to the commission's satisfaction that the expenses improve project economics, ensure project
implementation, or facilitate coordination with the development of transmission necessary to
transport energy produced by the project to market;
   (4) allocates recoverable costs appropriately between wholesale and retail customers;
    (5) terminates recovery when costs have been fully recovered or have otherwise been reflected
in a utility's rates.

in a manner consistent with this chapter.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.243, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Renewable energy standard facilities. The requirements of this section do not apply
to a wind energy conversion system or a solar electric generation facility that is intended to be used
to meet or exceed the obligations of section 216B.1691; provided that, after notice and comment,
the commission determines that the facility is a reasonable and prudent approach to meeting the
utility's obligations under that section. When making this determination, the commission may
consider the size of the facility relative to the utility's total need for renewable resources and
alternative approaches for supplying the renewable energy to be supplied by the proposed facility,
and must consider the facility's ability to promote economic development, as required under section
216B.1691, subdivision 9, maintain electric system reliability and consider impacts on ratepayers,
and other criteria as the commission may determine are relevant."
   Amend the title numbers accordingly
   And when so amended the bill do pass. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of sections 1 to 3, the following terms have the
meanings given:
    (1) "architectural paint" means interior and exterior architectural coatings, including paints and
stains purchased for commercial or homeowner use, but does not include architectural coatings
purchased for industrial or original equipment manufacturer use;
   (2) "consumer-based cost recovery system" means a system whereby the costs of the paint
stewardship pilot program are passed on to the consumer through the purchase price of the product;
   (3) "consumer paint stewardship fee" means the fee charged by the retailer or distributor on each
purchase of architectural paint sold in the state;
   (4) "manufacturer" means a manufacturer of architectural paint;
    (5) "paint stewardship fee" means the fee paid by each manufacturer that covers the amount of
the consumer paint stewardship fee for architectural paint the manufacturer sells in the state;
   (6) "postconsumer paint" means architectural paint not used by the purchaser; and
   (7) "retailer" means a person who sells architectural paint at retail.
     Subd. 2. Plan. (a) By July 1, 2008, manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail in this state
must, through a representative organization, implement a pilot stewardship program to undertake
responsibility for the development and implementation of strategies to reduce the generation of
postconsumer paint, promote the reuse of postconsumer paint, and collect, transport, and process
the end-of-life management of postconsumer paint. A consumer-based cost recovery system must
be established to collect a fee assessed on all paint sold in the state to recover from consumers the
life cycle costs of environmentally sound reuse or disposal of postconsumer paint. By July 1, 2008,
the consumer-based cost recovery system shall fund the pilot stewardship program in the following
manner:
    (1) all architectural paint manufacturers shall pay a paint stewardship fee based on the amount
of architectural paint they sell in the state;
    (2) all Minnesota retailers or distributors of architectural paint shall include a consumer paint
stewardship fee in the final retail sales price of all architectural paint sold by such retailers or
distributors in the state; and
    (3) architectural paint manufacturers shall recover the paint stewardship fees by invoicing each
of their Minnesota retailers or distributors of the architectural paint, who in turn, shall remit payment
for the fees to the architectural paint manufacturer. The funds used by retailers and distributors to
pay such invoices shall be derived from the consumer paint stewardship fee attached to the sale of
architectural paints by retailers and distributors.
    (b) To ensure that the consumer cost recovery mechanism is equitable and sustainable, by July 1,
2008, a uniform consumer paint stewardship fee must be established for all architectural paint sold
in the state. The assessed consumer paint stewardship fee must be sufficient to recover the costs of
the program and shall not exceed $1 per gallon.
   (c) Point-of-purchase material shall be provided to the consumer in a manner that is designed to
ensure that consumers are made aware that a consumer paint stewardship fee has been included in

processing of postconsumer paint under section 1 may engage in conduct to the extent necessary
to plan and implement its chosen organized collection or recycling system and is immune from
liability under state laws relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, and other
regulation of trade or commerce.
   Sec. 3. REPORTS.
    By January 15, 2010, manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail in this state must, through
a representative organization, submit a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the
committees in the senate and house of representatives that have primary jurisdiction over judiciary
policy describing the results of the paint stewardship pilot program and recommending whether the
exemption for anticompetitive conduct should be made permanent and any modifications to improve
the functioning and efficiency of the program.

    (b) A determination made on behalf of a peace officer or firefighter described in paragraph (a),
clause (2), must be at the request of the peace officer or firefighter made for the purposes of this
section. Determinations made in accordance with paragraph (a) are binding on the peace officer or
firefighter, employer, and state. The determination must be made by the executive director of the
Public Employees Retirement Association and is not subject to section 356.96, subdivision 2. Upon
making a determination, the executive director shall provide written notice to the peace officer or
firefighter and the employer. This notice must include:
   (1) a written statement of the reasons for the determination;
   (2) a notice that the person may petition for a review of the determination by requesting that a
contested case be initiated before the Office of Administrative Hearings, the cost of which must be
borne by the peace officer or firefighter and the employer; and
   (3) a statement that any person who does not petition for a review within 60 days is precluded
from contesting issues determined by the executive director in any other administrative review or
court procedure.
If, prior to the contested case hearing, additional information is provided to support the claim for
duty disability as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 41, the executive director may reverse the
determination without the requested hearing. If a hearing is held before the Office of Administrative
Hearings, the determination rendered by the judge conducting the fact-finding hearing is a final
decision and order under section 14.62, subdivision 2a, and is binding on the executive director,
the peace officer or firefighter, employer, and state. Review of a final determination made by the
Office of Administrative Hearings under this section may only be obtained by writ of certiorari to
the Minnesota Court of Appeals under sections 14.63 to 14.68. Only the peace officer or firefighter,
employer, and state have standing to participate in a judicial review of the decision of the Office of
Administrative Hearings.

coverage at the time of the injury under the employer's group health plan.

     c­
      )(d) The employer is responsible for the continued payment of the employer's contribution
for coverage of the officer or firefighter and, if applicable, the officer's or firefighter's dependents.
Coverage must continue for the officer or firefighter and, if applicable, the officer's or firefighter's
dependents until the officer or firefighter reaches or, if deceased, would have reached the age of 65.
However, coverage for dependents does not have to be continued after the person is no longer a
dependent.

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.047, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
     Subdivision 1. General rule. Unemployment benefits paid to an applicant, including extended,       ­
ad
­­d  i­i
   ­­t  ­n
       ­o ­­l­and shared work benefits, will be used in computing the future tax rate of a taxpaying base
           a­,
period employer or charged to the reimbursable account of a base period nonprofit or government
employer that has elected to be liable for reimbursements except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3.
The amount of unemployment benefits used in computing the future tax rate of taxpaying employers
or charged to the reimbursable account of a nonprofit or government employer that has elected to
be liable for reimbursements is the same percentage of the total amount of unemployment benefits
paid as the percentage of wage credits from the employer is of the total amount of wage credits from
all the applicant's base period employers.
  In making computations under this subdivision, the amount of wage credits, if not a whole dollar,
must be computed to the nearest whole dollar.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Payments that delay unemployment benefits. (a) An applicant is not eligible to
receive unemployment benefits for any week with respect to which the applicant is receiving, has
received, or has filed for payment, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, in the form of:
   (1) vacation pay paid upon temporary, indefinite, or seasonal separation. This clause does not
apply to (i) vacation pay paid upon a permanent separation from employment, or (ii) vacation pay
paid from a vacation fund administered by a union or a third party not under the control of the
employer;
   (2) severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, and any other payments, except earnings under
subdivision 5, and back pay under subdivision 6, paid by an employer because of, upon, or after
separation from employment, but only if the payment is considered wages at the time of payment
under section 268.035, subdivision 29; or
     (3) pension, retirement, or annuity payments from any plan contributed to by a base period
employer including the United States government, except Social Security benefits that are provided
for in subdivision 4. The base period employer is considered to have contributed to the plan if the
contribution is excluded from the definition of wages under section 268.035, subdivision 29, clause
(1).
   An applicant is not considered to have received the lump sum payment if the applicant
immediately deposits that payment in a qualified pension plan or account.
    (b) This subdivision applies to all the weeks of payment. Payments under paragraph (a), clauses
(1) and (2), are applied to the period immediately following the last day of employment­        ­­

    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received is divided by
the applicant's last level of regular weekly pay from the employer; or
   (2) if the payment is made in a lump sum, that sum is divided by the applicant's last level of
regular weekly pay from the employer.

   (c) If the payment is less than the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount,
unemployment benefits are reduced by the amount of the payment. If the computation of reduced
unemployment benefits is not a whole dollar, it is rounded down to the next lower whole dollar.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 16, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 16. Actively seeking suitable employment defined. (a) "Actively seeking suitable
employment" means those reasonable, diligent efforts an individual in similar circumstances would
make if genuinely interested in obtaining suitable employment under the existing conditions in the
labor market area. Limiting the search to positions that are not available or are above the applicant's
training, experience, and qualifications is not "actively seeking suitable employment."
    (b) To be considered "actively seeking suitable employment" an applicant must, when
reasonable, contact those employers from whom the applicant was laid off because of lack of work
and request suitable employment.
   (c) If reasonable prospects of suitable employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation do not exist, the applicant must actively seek other suitable employment to be
considered "actively seeking suitable employment." This applies to an applicant who is seasonally
unemployed.
     (d) An applicant who is seeking employment only through a union is ­             no­­t considered actively
seeking suitable employment ­          u­

1.8 times the state average unemployment rate for the prior 12-calendar month period and the state
average unemployment rate for the same 12-calendar month period was at least 4.6 percent. The
commissioner must calculate the applicable unemployment rates within 30 calendar days following
the end of the month. Once it has been calculated that the total unemployment rate in a county
equals or exceeds 1.8 times the state average unemployment rate for the prior 12-calendar month
period, the additional benefits are available beginning the Sunday following the date of calculation
and continuing for a minimum of 13 calendar weeks; or

   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the
meanings given them in this subdivision.
  (b) "Employer" means any person, business entity, or nonprofit organization, having one or more
employees in Minnesota, and includes the state and any political subdivisions of the state.
    (c) "Employee" means a person who performs services for hire in Minnesota for an employer,
but does not include independent contractors.
   (d) "Communication" means any printed or electronic document, letter, brochure, flyer,
advertisement, e-mail, text message, or similar means pertaining to union business or labor
organizing as provided under state or federal law.
    (e) "Employee organization" or "labor organization" have the same meanings given them in
sections 179.01, subdivision 6, and 179A.03, subdivision 6.
    Subd. 2. Prohibited practice. An employer may not refuse to hire a job applicant or discipline
or discharge an employee because the applicant or employee has received or responded to a
communication from an employee organization or labor organization. Nor shall an employer
prohibit an employee from receiving communications from an employee organization at the
employee's work location, work mailbox, in an employee break room or meal area, or on the
employee's work computer. Reasonable rules concerning the quantity of the communications,
political or other inappropriate content of the communications, attachments to electronic
communications, and appropriate nonwork times for review of these types of communications are
permitted. An employer may discipline or discharge an employee for violations of these rules in
accordance with the employer's personnel policies or union contract.
    Subd. 3. Remedy. The remedy for a violation of this section is through any applicable grievance
procedure. Damages are limited to wages and benefits lost by the individual because of the
violation."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.
Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

from student tuition, fees, and other required institutional charges, but in no event less than $10,000
nor greater than $250,000, except that a school may deposit a greater amount at its own discretion.

recruited from Minnesota.
    (2) A school required to obtain a private career school license due to the use of "academy,"

or board shall be required to provide a school bond of $10,000.
    (c) The bond shall run to the state of Minnesota and to any person who may have a cause of action
against the applicant arising at any time after the bond is filed and before it is canceled for breach
of any contract or agreement made by the applicant with any student. The aggregate liability of the
surety for all breaches of the conditions of the bond shall not exceed the principal sum deposited by
the school under paragraph (b). The surety of any bond may cancel it upon giving 60 days' notice
in writing to the office and shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after
the effective date of cancellation.
    (d) In lieu of bond, the applicant may deposit with the commissioner of finance a sum equal to
the amount of the required surety bond in cash, or securities as may be legally purchased by savings
banks or for trust funds in an aggregate market value equal to the amount of the required surety
bond.
    (e) Failure of a school to post and maintain the required surety bond or deposit under paragraph
(d) shall result in denial, suspension, or revocation of the school's license.

   (b) A person's eligibility terminates when the person becomes eligible for benefits under section
135A.52.
    (c) To determine eligibility, the commissioner may require official documentation, including the
person's federal form DD-214 or other official military discharge papers; correspondence from the
United States Veterans Administration; birth certificate; marriage certificate; proof of enrollment at
an eligible institution; signed affidavits; proof of residency; proof of identity; or any other official
documentation the commissioner considers necessary to determine eligibility.
    (d) The commissioner may deny eligibility or terminate benefits under this section to any

in writing to the commissioner at any time. The commissioner must rule on any application
or appeal within 30 days of receipt of all documentation that the commissioner requires. The
decision of the commissioner regarding an appeal is final. However, an applicant whose appeal
of an eligibility determination has been rejected by the commissioner may submit an additional
appeal of that determination in writing to the commissioner at any time that the applicant is able
to provide substantively significant additional information regarding the applicant's eligibility for
the program. An approval of an applicant's eligibility by the commissioner following an appeal by
the applicant is not retroactively effective for more than one year or the semester of the person's
original application, whichever is later.
    (e) Upon receiving an application with insufficient documentation to determine eligibility,
the commissioner must notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application that the
application is being suspended pending receipt by the commissioner of sufficient documentation
from the applicant to determine eligibility.

for use at any time according to program rules at any eligible institution.
    (b) The amount of educational assistance in any semester or term for an eligible person must
be determined by subtracting from the eligible person's cost of attendance the amount the person
received or was eligible to receive in that semester or term from:
   (1) the federal Pell Grant;
   (2) the state grant program under section 136A.121; and
    (3) any federal military or veterans educational benefits including but not limited to the
Montgomery GI Bill, GI Bill Kicker, the federal tuition assistance program, vocational rehabilitation
benefits, and any other federal benefits associated with the person's status as a veteran, except
veterans disability payments from the United States Veterans Administration.
    (c) The amount of educational assistance for any eligible person who is a full-time student must
not exceed the following:
   (1) $1,000 per semester or term of enrollment;
   (2) $2,000 per state fiscal year; and
   (3) $10,000 in a lifetime.
For a part-time student, the amount of educational assistance must not exceed $500 per semester or
term of enrollment. For the purpose of this paragraph, a part-time undergraduate student is a student
taking fewer than 12 credits or the equivalent for a semester or term of enrollment, and a part-time
graduate student is a student considered part time by the eligible institution the graduate student
is attending. The minimum award per term for the undergraduate and graduate students is $50 per
term."
