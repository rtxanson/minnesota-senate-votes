of the following:
     (i) coronary artery disease resulting in an acute infarction or requiring surgery;
     (ii) permanent neurological deficit resulting from cerebral vascular accident;

benefits subject to this chapter.
    Subd. 3. Assignee or beneficiary. Before paying the accelerated benefit, the insurer is required
to obtain from an assignee or irrevocable beneficiary a signed acknowledgment of concurrence
for payout. If the insurer making the accelerated benefit is itself the assignee under the policy, no
acknowledgment is required.
    Subd. 4. Criteria for payment. (a) Contract payment options shall include the option to take
the benefit as a lump sum. The benefit shall not be made available as an annuity contingent upon
the life of the insured.

   (b) No restrictions are permitted on the use of the proceeds.
   (c) If any death benefit remains after payment of an accelerated benefit, the accidental death
benefit provision, if any, in the policy or rider shall not be affected by the payment of the accelerated
benefit.
   Subd. 5. Disclosures. (a) The terminology "accelerated benefit" shall be included in the
descriptive title. Products regulated under this section shall not be described or marketed as
long-term care insurance or as providing long-term care benefits.
    (b) A disclosure statement is required at the time of application for the policy or rider and at the
time the accelerated benefit payment request is submitted that receipt of these accelerated benefits
may be taxable and that assistance should be sought from a personal tax advisor. The disclosure
statement shall be prominently displayed on the first page of the policy or rider and any other related
documents.
    (c)(1) A written disclosure including, but not necessarily limited to, a brief description of the
accelerated benefit and definitions of the conditions or occurrences triggering payment of the
benefits shall be given to the applicant. The description shall include an explanation of any effect of
the payment of a benefit on the policy's cash value, accumulation account, death benefit, premium,
policy loans, and policy liens.
    (i) In the case of agent solicited insurance, the agent shall provide the disclosure form to the
applicant prior to or concurrently with the application. Acknowledgment of the disclosure shall be
signed by the applicant and writing agent.
    (ii) In the case of a solicitation by direct response methods, the insurer shall provide the
disclosure form to the applicant at the time the policy is delivered, with a notice that a full premium
refund shall be received if the policy is returned to the company within the free look period.
    (iii) In the case of group insurance policies, the disclosure form shall be contained as part of the
certificate of coverage or any related document furnished by the insurer for the certificate holder.
    (2) If there is a premium or cost of insurance charge, the insurer shall give the applicant a generic
illustration numerically demonstrating any effect of the payment of a benefit on the policy's cash
value, accumulation account, death benefit, premium, policy loans, and policy liens.
    (i) In the case of agent-solicited insurance, the agent shall provide the illustration to the applicant
prior to or concurrently with the application.
    (ii) In the case of a solicitation by direct response methods, the insurer shall provide the

    (iii) In the case of group insurance policies, the disclosure form shall be contained as part of the
certificate of coverage or any related document furnished by the insurer for the certificate holder.
   (3) Disclosure of premium charge.
    (i) An insurer with financing options other than as described in subdivision 9, paragraph (a),
clauses (2) and (3), shall disclose to the policy owner any premium or cost of insurance charge for
the accelerated benefit. The insurer shall make a reasonable effort to assure that the certificate holder
is aware of any additional premium or cost of insurance charge if the certificate holder is required

to pay a charge.
     (ii) An insurer shall furnish an actuarial demonstration to the state insurance department when
filing the product disclosing the method of arriving at its cost for the accelerated benefit.
   (4) The insurer shall disclose to the policy owner any administrative expense charge. The insurer
shall make a reasonable effort to assure that the certificate holder is aware of any administrative
expense charge if the certificate holder is required to pay the charge.
    (d) When a policy owner or certificate holder requests an acceleration, the insurer shall send a
statement to the policy owner or certificate holder and irrevocable beneficiary showing any effect
that the payment of the accelerated benefit will have on the policy's cash value, accumulation
account, death benefit, premium, policy loans, and policy liens. The statement shall disclose that
receipt of accelerated benefit payments may adversely affect the recipient's eligibility for Medicaid
or other government benefits or entitlements. In addition, receipt of an accelerated benefit payment
may be taxable and assistance should be sought from a personal tax advisor. When a previous
disclosure statement becomes invalid as a result of an acceleration of the death benefit, the insurer
shall send a revised disclosure statement to the policy owner or certificate holder and irrevocable
beneficiary. When the insurer agrees to accelerate death benefits, the insurer shall issue an amended
schedule page to the policy holder or notify the certificate holder under a group policy to reflect
any new reduced in-force face amount of the contract.
    Subd. 6. Effective date of accelerated benefits. The accelerated benefit provision shall be
effective for accidents on the effective date of the policy or rider. The accelerated benefit provision
shall be effective for illness no more than 30 days following the effective date of the policy or rider.
    Subd. 7. Waiver of premiums. The insurer may offer a waiver of premium for the accelerated
benefit provision in the absence of a regular waiver of premium provision being in effect. At the
time the benefit is claimed, the insurer shall explain any continuing premium requirement to keep
the policy in force.
    Subd. 8. Discrimination. An insurer shall not unfairly discriminate among insureds with
differing qualifying events covered under the policy or among insureds with similar qualifying
events covered under the policy. An insurer shall not apply further conditions on the payment of
the accelerated benefits other than those conditions specified in the policy or rider.
   Subd. 9. Actuarial standards. (a) The issuer may use the following financing options:
   (1) requiring a premium charge or cost of insurance charge for the accelerated benefit. This
charge shall be based on sound actuarial principles. In the case of group insurance, the additional
cost may also be reflected in the experience rating.
    (2) paying a present value of the face amount. The calculation shall be based on any applicable
actuarial discount appropriate to the policy design. The interest rate or interest rate methodology
used in the calculation shall be based on sound actuarial principles and disclosed in the contract or
actuarial memorandum. The maximum interest rate used shall be no greater than the greater of:
   (i) current yield on 90-day treasury bills; or
   (ii) current maximum statutory adjustable policy loan interest rate.
1004                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [31ST DAY

    (b) The insurer may accrue an interest charge on the amount of the accelerated benefits. The
interest rate or interest rate methodology used in the calculation shall be based on sound actuarial
principles and disclosed in the contract or actuarial memorandum. The maximum interest rate shall
be no greater than the greater of:
   (1) current yield on 90-day treasury bills; or
   (2) current maximum statutory adjustable policy loan interest rate.
    The interest rate accrued on the portion of the lien that is equal in amount to the cash value of
the contact at the time of the benefit acceleration shall be no more than the policy loan interest rate
stated in the contract.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in clause (2), when an accelerated benefit is payable, there shall be no
more than a pro rata reduction in the cash value based on the percentage of death benefits accelerated
to produce the accelerated benefit payment.
    (2) Alternatively, the payment of accelerated benefits, any administrative expense charges, any
future premiums, and any accrued interest can be considered a lien against the death benefit of the
policy or rider and the access to the cash value may be restricted to any excess of the cash value over
the sum of any other outstanding loans and the lien. Future access to additional policy loans could
also be limited to any excess of the cash value over the sum of the lien and any other outstanding
policy loans.
    (d) When payment of an accelerated benefit results in a pro rata reduction in the cash value,
the payment may not be applied toward repaying an amount greater than a pro rata portion of any
outstanding policy loans.
   Subd. 10. Actuarial disclosure and reserves. (a) A qualified actuary should describe the
accelerated benefits, the risks, the expected costs, and the calculation of statutory reserved in
an actuarial memorandum accompanying each state filing. The insurer shall maintain in its files
descriptions of the bases and procedures used to calculate benefits payable under these provisions.
These descriptions shall be made available for examination by the commissioner upon request.
    (b)(1) When benefits are provided through the acceleration of benefits under group or individual
life policies or riders to such policies, policy reserves shall be determined in accordance with
the Standard Valuation Law. All valuation assumptions used in constructing the reserves shall
be determined as appropriate for statutory valuation purposes by a member in good standing of
the American Academy of Actuaries. Mortality tables and interest currently recognized for life
insurance reserves by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) may be used
as well as appropriate assumptions for the other provisions incorporated in the policy form. The
actuary shall follow both actuarial standards and certification for good and sufficient reserves.
Reserves in the aggregate should be sufficient to cover:
   (i) policies upon which no claim has yet arisen; and
   (ii) policies upon which an accelerated claim has arisen;
    (2) For policies and certificates that provide actuarially equivalent benefits, no additional
reserves need to be established.

    (3) Policy liens and policy loans, including accrued interest, represent assets of the company for
statutory reporting purposes. For a policy on which the policy lien exceeds the policy's statutory
reserve liability, the excess shall be held as a nonadmitted asset.
   Subd. 11. Filing requirement. The filing and prior approval of forms containing an accelerated
benefit is required."

truthfulness of the contents of the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
    The affidavit shall also contain a signed and dated oath in the form required by section 705 of
the Help America Vote Act, Public Law 107-252, which must read:
    "I swear or affirm, under penalty of perjury, that:
    I am a member of the uniformed services or merchant marine on active duty or an eligible spouse
or dependent of such a member; a United States citizen temporarily residing outside the United
States; or other United States citizen residing outside the United States; and I am a United States
citizen, at least 18 years of age (or will be by the date of the election), and I am eligible to vote in
the requested jurisdiction; I have not been convicted of a felony, or other disqualifying offense, or
been adjudicated mentally incompetent, or, if so, my voting rights have been reinstated; and I am
not registering, requesting a ballot, or voting in any other jurisdiction in the United States except
the jurisdiction cited in this voting form. In voting, I have marked and sealed my ballot in private
and have not allowed any person to observe the marking of the ballot, except for those authorized
to assist voters under state or federal law. I have not been influenced.
    My signature and date below indicate when I completed this document.
    The information on this form is true, accurate, and complete to the best of my knowledge.
I understand that a material misstatement of fact in completion of this document may constitute
grounds for a conviction for perjury."
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 203B.22, is amended to read:
    203B.22 MAILING BALLOTS.
    The county auditor shall mail the appropriate ballots, as promptly as possible, to an absent voter
whose application has been recorded under section 203B.19. If the county auditor determines that
a voter is not eligible to vote at the primary but will be eligible to vote at the general election, only
general election ballots shall be mailed. Only one set of ballots shall be mailed to any applicant for
any election, except that the county auditor may mail a replacement ballot to a voter whose ballot
has been spoiled or lost in transit or whose mailing address has changed after the date on which the
original application was submitted as confirmed by the county auditor. Ballots to be sent outside
the United States shall be given priority in mailing. A county auditor may make use of any special
service provided by the United States government for the mailing of voting materials under sections
203B.16 to 203B.27.
    Sec. 8. [203B.225] TRANSMITTING AND RETURNING BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Transmitting ballot and voter certification. Upon receipt of a properly
completed application, the county auditor may electronically transmit to the voter the appropriate
ballots, instructions, and affidavit form and certification of voter eligibility provided in section
203B.21, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 2. Returning voted ballots. The voter must return the voted ballots and the certificate
of voter eligibility to the county auditor in a sealed envelope. Upon receipt of a ballot, the county
auditor must immediately compare the information provided on the absentee ballot application with
the information provided on the certificate of voter eligibility. After the information on the certificate

of voter eligibility has been verified, the certificate must be attached to the ballot secrecy envelope
and placed with the other absentee ballots for the precinct in which the voter resides.
    Subd. 3. Rejecting transmitted ballots. If the county auditor cannot verify that the ballots were
returned by the same person to whom the absentee ballot application was transmitted, the ballots
must be rejected and no votes on the ballots may be counted.
     Sec. 9. [203B.227] WRITE-IN ABSENTEE BALLOT.
    An eligible voter who will be outside the territorial limits of the United States during the 180
days prior to the state general election may use a state write-in absentee ballot to vote in any federal,
state, or local election. In a state or local election, a vote for a political party without specifying the
name of a candidate must not be counted.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 203B.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Check of voter eligibility; proper execution of affidavit. Upon receipt of an
absentee ballot returned as provided in sections 203B.16 to 203B.27, the election judges shall
compare the voter's name with the names appearing on their copy of the application records to
insure that the ballot is from a voter eligible to cast an absentee ballot under sections 203B.16 to
203B.27. The election judges shall mark the return envelope "Accepted" and initial or sign the
return envelope below the word "Accepted" if the election judges are satisfied that:
   (1) the voter's name on the return envelope appears in substantially the same form as on the
application records provided to the election judges by the county auditor;
  (2) the voter has signed the federal oath prescribed pursuant to section 705(b)(2) of the Help
America Vote Act, Public Law 107-252;
     (3) the voter has set forth the same voter's military identification number o                          ­­ r, passport number,

envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject an absentee ballot.
   Election judges must note the reason for rejection on the back of the envelope in the space
provided for that purpose.
   Failure to return unused ballots shall not invalidate a marked ballot, but a ballot shall not be
counted if the affidavit on the return envelope is not properly executed. In all other respects the

under section 12.31, or if a natural disaster or armed conflict involving the United States Armed
Forces, or mobilization of those forces, including National Guard and reserve components of this
state, makes substantial compliance with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting
Act impossible or unreasonable, the secretary of state may prescribe, by emergency orders, special
procedures or requirements necessary to facilitate absentee voting by those citizens directly affected
who otherwise are eligible to vote in this state. The secretary of state shall adopt rules describing
the emergency powers and the situations in which the powers must be exercised."

best interests of the public. With respect to any renewable electric power generation facility, or any
portion of a renewable electric power generation facility, the county may exercise the powers granted
to a municipal power agency and to a city under Minnesota Statutes, sections 453.52, subdivisions
1, 6, 7, and 9 to 13; 453.54, subdivisions 1, 2, 4 to 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 17 to 21; 453.55; 453.57;

Statutes, section 453.58, subdivision 3, does not give the county the authority to enter into contracts
with a municipal power agency for the purchase, sale, exchange, or transmission of electric energy
and other services.
