   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [325E.45] MINNESOTA MEDICAL PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT.
   Subdivision 1. Citation. This section may be cited as the "Minnesota Medical Privacy Protection
Act."
    Subd. 2. Findings. The legislature finds and declares that the protection of financial and
medical debt information of patients, and the provision of health care services, products, or devices
to patients, is an important objective of the government of this state.
    The legislature also finds and declares that medical debt incurred by patients should not prevent
patients from receiving health care services, products, or devices from health care providers that
accept medical assistance. Therefore, the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest
to ensure that health care providers that accept medical assistance do not unnecessarily disclose an
individual patient's financial or medical debt information to another entity, and that such health care
providers do not obtain or use information from any entity that gathers, maintains, evaluates, or
distributes individual patient financial or debt information until after health care services, products,
or devices have been provided by the health care provider to the patient.
    Subd. 3. Purpose. The legislature declares it to be the purpose of this section to protect a patient's
financial and medical debt information and to ensure the provision of health care services, products,
or devices despite a patient's medical debt.
    Subd. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the terms defined in this subdivision have
the meanings given them.
    (a) "Health care provider" has the meaning given in section 62J.03, subdivision 8, but does not
include a "housing with services establishment," as defined in section 144D.01, subdivision 4, or an
entity providing assisted living services, as described in section 144G.01.
    (b) "Medical debt information" means any information relating to the payment history or
indebtedness of a patient regarding health care services, products, or devices provided by a health
care provider to a patient.
    Subd. 5. Prohibited conduct. A health care provider shall not disclose an individual patient's
financial or medical debt information to another entity.
    A health care provider shall not obtain or use information from any entity that gathers,
maintains, evaluates, or distributes individual patient financial or debt information until after health
care services, products, or devices have been provided by the health care provider to the patient.
    Subd. 6. General exclusions. Nothing in this section prevents a health care provider from
sharing an individual patient's financial or medical debt information with the patient; the patient's
insurer; the patient's authorized third-party debt management services provider as defined in section
332A.02; a third-party debt collector as defined in section 332.31, that the health care provider has
contracted to collect the patient's medical debt; an attorney, accountant, or auditor employed by or
acting on behalf of the health care provider; or the state or federal government as required by law.
   Subd. 7. Severability clause. Each provision of this section is severable. Application of any
87TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008                                         6961

provision in this section to a particular circumstance is severable. If any provision of this section
or application of a provision of this section is found to be contrary to law and unenforceable, the
remaining provisions and applications of this section shall remain valid and enforceable under
section 645.20.
   Subd. 8. Enforcement. This section may be enforced pursuant to section 8.31.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Judiciary.
Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

  Senator Prettner Solon from the Committee on Energy, Utilities, Technology and
Communications, to which was re-referred
    S.F. No. 2818: A bill for an act relating to environment; establishing principles of a cap and
trade program for greenhouse gas emissions; establishing a climate trust fund, and specifying its
goals and uses; requiring studies; appropriating money from the general fund; proposing coding for
new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 216H.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [216H.10] TITLE.
   This act may be cited as the Green Solutions Act of 2008.
   Sec. 2. [216H.11] CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Intent. It is the intent of the legislature that Minnesota participate in the midwest
regional cap and trade program to help achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals
established in section 216H.02, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 2. Principles. The legislature recognizes that the atmosphere and climate are common
assets, and damage to them by greenhouse gas emissions are costs now borne by the public. Capping
greenhouse gas emissions gives a market value to the ability to emit, and that market value should
accrue to the public. It is the intent of the legislature that any cap and trade program:
   (1) should cover as many emitting sectors as is administratively feasible, but excluding sectors
from which emissions cannot be reliably quantified;
   (2) should provide that the allowances created under a cap and trade system should accrue to the
benefit of the public. To the extent that allowances are distributed through an auction, the revenue
would help consumers and energy-intensive industries pay their energy costs and reduce their energy
costs more quickly. Business concerns about paying the cost of allowances must be balanced with
benefit to the public;
   (3) should allow auctions to be phased in if necessary to protect consumers and industries from
sudden price increases, provided that protections are in place to ensure that windfall profits do not
accrue to entities allocated allowances during the transition;
6962                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [87TH DAY

   (4) should be designed to obtain the emission reductions necessary to meet the cap from the
capped sectors themselves rather than from sectors outside the cap;
   (5) should not increase the emissions cap by allowing the issuance of allowances beyond the
limits specified in section 216H.02; and
   (6) should provide for equity to communities at risk of disproportionate economic and
environmental impacts.
   Sec. 3. [216H.12] MIDWESTERN GREENHOUSE GAS ACCORD.
    (a) By December 1, 2008, the commissioner of commerce and the commissioner of the Pollution
Control Agency shall submit a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and
house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy, environmental
policy, and transportation policy:
   (1) the status of the development of a model rule establishing a regional cap and trade program
under the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord;
   (2) implementation mechanisms in the model rule, including required legislation;
   (3) whether the regional cap and trade program will operate in a time frame that will allow
Minnesota to meet the greenhouse gas reductions goals under section 216H.02, subdivision 1; and
   (4) an evaluation of legislation enacted or pending in congress to implement a federal cap
and trade program and whether implementation of a regional program is consistent with a federal
program.
    The report must address the degree to which any model rule being developed under the
Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord incorporates the principles set forth in section 216H.11,
and will operate in a time frame that will allow Minnesota to meet its greenhouse gas emissions
reduction goals under section 216H.02, subdivision 1. If a model rule incorporating those principles
and in accord with the state's emissions-reduction goals is not yet ready for adoption, or is unlikely
to be adopted, the report must identify options for Minnesota to supplement the regional agreement
with state policies, to join another regional cap and trade program, or to implement a cap and trade
program in Minnesota alone.
    (b) The senate and house, in accordance with the rules of their respective bodies, must appoint
a bipartisan team of six legislators to serve in an advisory role to the governor's Midwestern
Greenhouse Gas Accord stakeholder group. The legislators must receive regular briefings from the
stakeholder group and have an opportunity to participate as observers in meetings of the regional
negotiations and may offer advice.
   (c) Any cap and trade agreements entered into are not effective in Minnesota until enacted into
law.
   Sec. 4. [216H.13] STUDIES.
    Subdivision 1. Governance study. The commissioner of commerce may contract with the
University of Minnesota or other state public institutions of higher education or may issue a request
for proposals for a study that describes and analyzes several options regarding how decisions on
expenditures of revenues captured by any cap and trade program may be made. The study must
87TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008                                         6963

examine:
  (1) the role that the legislature, citizens, technical experts, and state agencies may play in decision
making; and
    (2) innovative decision-making structures and processes, including the Legislative-Citizens
Commission on Minnesota Resources, and other examples in Minnesota and other states and
countries that may offer useful models to consider. The results of the study must be reported to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house committees with primary jurisdiction
over energy and environmental policy by January 1, 2009. The commissioner may combine the
study under this subdivision with the study described in subdivision 2.
    Subd. 2. Economic and emissions study. The commissioner of commerce shall conduct a study
of the economic, environmental, and public health costs and benefits of a cap and trade program
incorporating the principles established in section 216H.11. The study shall consider the impact of
the cap and trade program on individual industrial sectors subject to the program and on the state
economy and consumers, and how expenditures of any auction revenues on the measures identified
in subdivision 3 can reduce the economic costs and increase the economic, environmental, and
public health benefits. The study must include:
   (1) estimates of allowance prices and rates of investment by facilities subject to the cap and trade
program in infrastructure and equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases over time;
    (2) estimates of increases in energy prices for fuels that produce greenhouse gas emissions, the
impact of price increases on businesses and family income, and the degree of regressivity of the
price increases and how to avoid regressive impacts;
   (3) projections of likely revenues if allowances are auctioned;
    (4) a detailed estimate of the degree to which different levels of expenditures of auction proceeds
on the options listed under subdivision 3, clauses (1) to (6), would:
   (i) reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
   (ii) reduce economic costs to industry and households;
   (iii) yield jobs and other economic benefits by stimulating economic activity, promoting the
growth of new businesses, reducing how much money leaves the state to buy fossil fuels, or other
means;
   (iv) result in environmental and public health co-benefits by reducing pollutants other than
greenhouse gases, improving habitat, or other means; and
   (v) otherwise meet the goals identified in subdivision 4;
   (5) discussion of the potential for any allowances allocated by the program to lead to windfall
profits rather than be used to reduce consumer prices;
   (6) an analysis of options to mitigate adverse competitive impacts on state businesses and
methods to reduce disruptive impacts on workers, businesses, and consumers;
   (7) options for criteria that decision makers can use to determine how to allocate expenditures
6964                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [87TH DAY

among the spending options listed under subdivision 3, balancing the goals set forth in subdivision
4;
    (8) analysis of various mechanisms for protecting job loss in energy intensive industries subject
to competition from outside the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Accord region including steel, cement,
paper, pulp, aluminum, and chemicals, including an analysis of possible mechanisms to account for
the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and transportation of imported goods;
and
    (9) analysis of various mechanisms to provide for equity to communities at risk of
disproportionate economic or environmental impacts.
   The study shall consider the data and policy recommendations developed through the Minnesota
Climate Change Advisory Group as well as the growing literature related to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. By January 1, 2009, the study must be submitted to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the senate and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over
energy policy and environmental policy.
   Subd. 3. Expenditures to be studied. The study required under subdivision 2 shall consider the
impacts of the following types of expenditures:
   (1) direct per capita rebates to Minnesotans;
   (2) grants and incentives to consumers to invest in energy efficiency and utilize renewable energy
sources, or in other technologies, products or practices that help Minnesotans reduce energy costs,
energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions;
   (3) financial assistance to businesses that install technologies that reduce their facilities'
greenhouse gas emissions, targeting energy-intensive industries facing competitors not subject to
comparable regulation including, but not limited to, steel, pulp, paper, cement, chemicals, and
aluminum;
   (4) investments in public infrastructure that reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
   (5) investments in worker training and retraining programs; and
   (6) incentives for carbon sequestration on forest and farmland.
A majority of expenditures from the fund must be directed to uses under clauses (1) and (2).
    Subd. 4. Study criteria. The study required by subdivision 2 shall determine the extent to
which expenditures on the measures identified in subdivision 3 assist Minnesota in its transition to a
low greenhouse gas-emitting economy, and increase the economic gains and reduce the dislocating
impacts of the transition. Specifically, the study shall discuss the extent to which expenditures meet
the following goals:
   (1) produce cost-effective emission reductions;
   (2) increase sustainable economic development, job creation, and job growth;
   (3) reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sectors that do not participate in the cap and trade
program;

   (4) reduce disruptive economic impacts of the transition on workers, businesses, and consumers;
    (5) equitably distribute the costs and benefits among state residents, communities, and economic
sectors;
   (6) assist low-income and other consumers to reduce their costs associated with greenhouse gas
emissions; and
   (7) protect and enhance public health, environmental quality, wildlife habitat, and the state's
natural resources.
   Sec. 5. ASSESSMENT; APPROPRIATION.
   The commissioner of commerce may assess up to $500,000 under Minnesota Statutes, section
216B.62. The sum assessed is appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose of section 4.
The assessment is not subject to the cap on assessments provided by Minnesota Statutes, section
216B.62, or any other law.
   Sec. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Sections 1 to 5 are effective the day following final enactment."

subdivision have the meanings given them.
   (b) "Reductions" means the greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals specified in section
216H.02, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 2. Purpose. This section is intended to create a nonexclusive, regular, mandated process

    Subd. 3. Quantification of annual reduction required. By November 1 of each year, the
commissioners of commerce and the pollution control agency shall jointly report to the chairs
and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with primary policy jurisdiction
over energy and environmental issues and also disseminate through available public channels the
reductions required in each year until 2050. The reductions must be based on and supported by
the best available technical evidence that also must be reported to the legislature and publicly
disseminated in easily understood nontechnical terms.
    Subd. 4. Annual strategic plan. The commissioner shall include in the annual report under
subdivision 3 a detailed plan for attaining the reductions. The plan must include draft legislation,
including any budget requests, that are necessary for reduction attainment. The plan must specify
the reductions that are required for a year and the reductions attributable to each component of the
plan proposed to attain the reduction. The specifics of the plan for a particular year may be more
general the more future the year but the plan must be as specific as available information will justify.
The plan must be based on the principles specified in subdivision 5.
   Subd. 5. Reduction principles. The reduction plan must be based on the following principles:
   (1) the reductions must be attained;
   (2) the reductions must be attained on a schedule that keeps pace with the reduction timetable
required by section 216H.02, subdivision 1;
    (3) conservation, including ceasing some activities, doing some activities less, and doing some
activities more energy efficiently, is the first choice for reduction;
   (4) public education is a key component;
   (5) all levels of government should lead by example;
   (6) strategies that may lead to economic dislocation should be phased in and should be coupled
with strategies that address the dislocation; and
   (7) the plan must coordinate with other federal and regional greenhouse gas emission reduction
requirements so that the state benefits and is not penalized from its reduction activities.
    Subd. 6. Public education. Every plan must include a public education component. The
education component must provide for dissemination of the latest evidence on the effects of
greenhouse gas emissions. The education component must also stress that the reductions not only
seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to conserve nonrenewable fossil fuel resources
that have a dwindling supply. The fact that this dwindling supply may ultimately lead to the
elimination of certain activities that are proposed to be limited by a plan must be emphasized.
   Subd. 7. Other states. Every plan must include a review of the activities of other states to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, including a review of budgetary initiatives to achieve reductions.
    Subd. 8. Stakeholder involvement. Public comment must be solicited in the development of
the plan. The commissioners of commerce and the pollution control agency shall make a formal
presentation of the plan to the Legislative Electric Energy Task Force at a meeting called for that
purpose in November of each year. The commissioner shall provide the task force members with a
preliminary draft plan by October 1 of each year."

    Sec. 3. [469.3101] STATE REVIEW CRITERIA.
    (a) The commissioner may only approve a business subsidy agreement after considering:
   (1) whether the business has local or Minnesota competitors that will be significantly and
adversely effected by the business subsidy agreement;
   (2) whether the proposed job creation, job retention, and capital investment is commensurate
with the estimated tax benefits provided to the business by participating in JOBZ; and
    (3) whether other financial assistance is available.
   (b) Additionally, the commissioner may only approve a business subsidy agreement after
considering if without the estimated tax benefits, the business:
    (1) would not have expanded or began operations within Minnesota;
    (2) would not have relocated from outside the state to Minnesota; or
   (3) would have moved to another state or expanded in another state rather than remaining or
expanding in Minnesota.
    (c) The local government unit and the qualified business must provide the commissioner with the
information that the commissioner needs to review a business subsidy agreement under paragraphs
(a) and (b). The information must be in the form and manner required by the commissioner.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 4. [469.3102] BUSINESS SUBSIDY AGREEMENTS; REPORTS.

effective until the commissioner has approved the agreement in writing. The commissioner may
not approve an agreement that violates sections 116J.993 to 116J.995 or 469.310 to 469.3201. The
commissioner may not approve an agreement unless:
   (1) the qualified business is required to create or retain a minimum number of jobs;
    (2) the agreement defines "jobs" for purposes of determining compliance with wage and job goals
as all jobs and only those jobs that constitute "employment" for purposes of state unemployment
insurance;
   (3) the qualified business is required to report all jobs created or retained because of JOBZ as a
separate business location for purposes of section 268.044; and
   (4) the qualified business agrees to provide the appropriate data practices release so that the
commissioner of revenue and the commissioner of employment and economic development can
monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement.
   Subd. 3. Standard agreement. The commissioner must develop and require the use of a standard
business subsidy agreement that imposes definitive and enforceable obligations on the qualified
business.
    Subd. 4. Business subsidy reports. (a) A local government unit must annually report to the
commissioner on the progress of the qualified business in meeting the goals listed in the business
subsidy agreement. The report must be filed with the commissioner within 30 days of the end
of the immediately preceding yearly period for which job creation, job retention, or investment
obligations are imposed on a business and must be in a form prescribed by the commissioner. The
commissioner must schedule department compliance reviews and reporting dates under business
subsidy agreements so that reports are due throughout the year and compliance reviews are done on
a continuous basis as reports are filed.
    (b) The commissioner must hold a qualified business out of compliance or remove the business
from the program if the qualified business fails to provide the information requested by the
local government unit for the report under paragraph (a) within 30 days of written notice that
the information is overdue. This report is in lieu of the reports required under section 116J.994,
subdivisions 7 and 8.
    Subd. 5. Public notice and hearing. A local government unit must provide public notice and
hearing as required under section 116J.994, subdivision 5, before approving a business subsidy
agreement. Public notice of a proposed business subsidy agreement must be published in a local
newspaper of general circulation. The public hearing must be held in a location specified by the
local government unit. Notwithstanding the requirements of section 116J.994, subdivision 5, the
commissioner is not required to provide an additional public notice and hearing when entering into
a business subsidy agreement with a local government unit and a qualified business.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.312, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Duration limit. (a) The maximum duration of a zone is 12 years. The applicant may
request a shorter duration. The commissioner may specify a shorter duration, regardless of the
requested duration.

    (b) The duration limit under this subdivision and the duration of the zone for purposes of
allowance of tax incentives described in section 469.315 is extended by three calendar years for
each parcel of property that meets the following requirements:
    (1) the qualified business operates an ethanol plant, as defined in section 41A.09, on the site that
includes the parcel; and
    (2) the business subsidy agreement was executed after April 30, 2006.
   (c) (1) Notwithstanding the 12-year zone limitation, all qualified businesses that sign a business
subsidy agreement, as required under sections 469.310, subdivision 11, and 469.313, before
December 31, 2015, are entitled to claim the tax benefits for which they qualify under section
469.315 for the year in which the business subsidy agreement is signed and ten additional years.
    (2) Notwithstanding the 12-year zone limitation, all qualified businesses that sign a business
subsidy agreement, as required under sections 469.310, subdivision 11, and 469.313, before
December 31, 2015, and are located in a targeted rural opportunity community, as defined under
section 116J.03, subdivision 4, are entitled to claim the tax benefits for which they qualify under
section 469.315 for the year in which the business subsidy agreement is signed and 12 additional
years.
    (3) This paragraph does not apply to:
   (i) any acreage designated as a job opportunity building zone for which any person has fully
executed a business subsidy agreement before this paragraph became effective; or
    (ii) any trade or business that relocated as defined in section 469.310, subdivision 12, and
received benefits under section 469.315 prior to the relocation.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 6. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
    The revisor of statutes shall change the term "applicant" or similar terms to "local government
unit" or similar terms wherever the term appears in Minnesota Statutes, sections 469.310 to 469.3201
and in any other sections referring to the JOBZ program. The revisor shall also make grammatical
changes related to the changes in terms.

the qualified business is located, determines that requiring repayment of the tax is not in the best
interest of the state or the local government units and the business ceased operating as a result of
circumstances beyond its control including, but not limited to:
   (1) a natural disaster;
   (2) unforeseen industry trends; or
   (3) loss of a major supplier or customer.
    (b)(1) The commissioner shall waive repayment required under subdivision 1a if the
commissioner has waived repayment by the operating business under subdivision 1, unless the
person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone was a contributing
factor in the qualified business becoming subject to repayment under subdivision 1;
   (2) the commissioner shall waive the repayment required under subdivision 1a, even if the
repayment has not been waived for the operating business if:
   (i) the person that received benefits without having to operate a business in the zone and the
business that operated in the zone are not related parties as defined in section 267(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31, 2007; and

in 2008 and thereafter. The rest of this section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004, except
that for violations that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if
the business has repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 2. [] BREACH OF AGREEMENTS BY BUSINESSES THAT CONTINUE TO
OPERATE IN ZONE.
    (a) A "business in violation of its business subsidy agreement but not subject to section 469.319"
means a business that is operating in violation of the business subsidy agreement but maintains a
level of operations in the zone that does not subject it to the repayment provisions of section 469.319,
subdivision 1, clause (1).
    (b) A business described in paragraph (a) that does not sign a new or amended business subsidy
agreement, as authorized under paragraph (h), is subject to repayment of benefits under section
469.319 from the day that it ceases to perform in the zone a substantial level of activities described
in the business subsidy agreement.
    (c) A business described in paragraph (a) ceases being a qualified business after the last day that
it has to meet the goals stated in the agreement.
   (d) A business is not entitled to any income tax or franchise tax benefits, including refundable

credits, for any part of the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business under
paragraph (c), and thereafter. A business is not eligible for sales tax benefits beginning with goods
or services purchased or put to a taxable use on the day that it is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c). Property is not exempt from tax under section 272.02, subdivision 64, for any
taxes payable in the year following the year in which the business is no longer a qualified business
under paragraph (c), and thereafter.
     (e) A business described in paragraph (a) that wants to resume eligibility for benefits under
section 469.315 must request that the commissioner of employment and economic development
determine the length of time that the business is ineligible for benefits. The commissioner shall
determine the length of ineligibility by applying the proportionate level of performance under the
agreement to the total duration of the zone as measured from the date that the business subsidy
agreement was executed. The length of time must not be less than one full year for each tax benefit
listed in section 469.315. The commissioner of employment and economic development and the
appropriate local government officials shall consult with the commissioner of revenue to ensure
that the period of ineligibility includes at least one full year of benefits for each tax.
   (f) The length of ineligibility determined under paragraph (e) must be applied by reducing the
zone duration for the property by the duration of the ineligibility.
   (g) The zone duration of property that has been adjusted under paragraph (f) must not be altered
again to permit the business additional benefits under section 469.315.
    (h) A business described in paragraph (a) becomes eligible for benefits available under section
469.315 by entering into a new or amended business subsidy agreement with the appropriate local
government unit. The new or amended agreement must cover a period beginning from the date of
ineligibility under the original business subsidy agreement, through the zone duration determined
by the commissioner under paragraph (f). No exemption of property taxes under section 272.02,
subdivision 64, is available under the new or amended agreement for property taxes due or paid
before the date of the final execution of the new or amended agreement, but unpaid taxes due after
that date need not be paid.
   (i) A business that violates the terms of an agreement authorized under paragraph (h) is
permanently barred from seeking benefits under section 469.315 and is subject to the repayment
provisions under section 469.319 effective from the day that the business ceases to operate as a
qualified business in the zone under the second agreement.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2004. For violations
that occur before the day following final enactment, this section does not apply if the business has
repaid the benefits or the commissioner has granted a waiver.
  Sec. 3. [469.3192] PROHIBITION AGAINST AMENDMENTS TO BUSINESS SUBSIDY
AGREEMENT.
    Except as authorized under section , under no circumstance shall terms of any agreement required
as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315 be amended to change job
creation, job retention, or wage goals included in the agreement.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all agreements executed before, on, or after the effective date.

  Sec. 4. [469.3193] CERTIFICATION OF CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY FOR JOBZ
BENEFITS.
    (a) By December 1 of each year, every qualified business must certify to the commissioner of
revenue, on a form prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, whether it is in compliance with any
agreement required as a condition for eligibility for benefits listed under section 469.315. A business
that fails to submit the certification, or any business, including those still operating in the zone, that
submits a certification that the commissioner of revenue later determines materially misrepresents
the business's compliance with the agreement, is subject to the repayment provisions under section
469.319 from January 1 of the year in which the report is due or the date that the business became
subject to section 469.319, whichever is earlier. Any such business is permanently barred from
obtaining benefits under section 469.315. For purposes of this section, the bar applies to an entity
and also applies to any individuals or entities that have an ownership interest of at least 20 percent
of the entity.
    (b) Before the sanctions under paragraph (a) apply to a business that fails to submit the
certification, the commissioner of revenue shall send notice to the business, demanding that the
certification be submitted within 30 days and advising the business of the consequences for failing
to do so. The commissioner of revenue shall notify the commissioner of employment and economic
development and the appropriate job opportunity subzone administrator whenever notice is sent to
a business under this paragraph.
   (c) The certification required under this section is public.
    (d) The commissioner of revenue shall promptly notify the commissioner of employment and
economic development of all businesses that certify that they are not in compliance with the terms
of their business subsidy agreement and all businesses that fail to file the certification.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

of its investments to qualified small businesses within the region. The commissioner shall define
"region" for the purposes of this section.
    Subd. 6. Limitations. The taxpayer must claim the credit in the same tax year for which the fund

made in qualifying regional investment funds after the fund is certified by the commissioner of
employment and economic development under subdivision 4.
    Subd. 7. Statement of credit share. Each fund must provide to each investor a statement
indicating the investor's share of the credit certified to the fund under subdivision 4, based on

business.
    Subd. 8. Carryover. If the amount of the credit under this section for any taxable year exceeds
the amount reached under subdivision 2, clause (1), the excess is a credit carryover to each of the ten
succeeding taxable years. The entire amount of the excess unused credit for the taxable year must
be carried first to the earliest of the taxable years to which the credit may be carried. The amount of
the unused credit that may be added under this subdivision may not exceed the taxpayer's liability
for tax, less the credit for the taxable year.

   (b) Any credits taken on a tax return shall be returned to the commissioner of revenue as an
underpayment of tax, if:

means a physician assistant authorized to prescribe, dispense, and administer under chapter 147A, or
an advanced practice nurse authorized to prescribe, dispense, and administer under section 148.235.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 151.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Prescribing and filing. (a) A licensed practitioner in the course of professional
practice only, may prescribe, administer, and dispense a legend drug, and may cause the same to be
administered by a nurse, a physician assistant, or medical student or resident under the practitioner's
direction and supervision, and may cause a person who is an appropriately certified, registered,
or licensed health care professional to prescribe, dispense, and administer the same within the
expressed legal scope of the person's practice as defined in Minnesota Statutes. A licensed
practitioner may prescribe a legend drug, without reference to a specific patient, by directing a
nurse, pursuant to section 148.235, subdivisions 8 and 9, physician assistant, or medical student
or resident to adhere to a particular practice guideline or protocol when treating patients whose
condition falls within such guideline or protocol, and when such guideline or protocol specifies the
circumstances under which the legend drug is to be prescribed and administered. An individual
who verbally, electronically, or otherwise transmits a written, oral, or electronic order, as an agent
of a prescriber, shall not be deemed to have prescribed the legend drug. This paragraph applies to a
physician assistant only if the physician assistant meets the requirements of section 147A.18.
    (b) A licensed practitioner that dispenses for profit a legend drug that is to be administered
orally, is ordinarily dispensed by a pharmacist, and is not a vaccine, must file with the practitioner's
licensing board a statement indicating that the practitioner dispenses legend drugs for profit, the

general circumstances under which the practitioner dispenses for profit, and the types of legend drugs
generally dispensed. It is unlawful to dispense legend drugs for profit after July 31, 1990, unless
the statement has been filed with the appropriate licensing board. For purposes of this paragraph,
"profit" means (1) any amount received by the practitioner in excess of the acquisition cost of a
legend drug for legend drugs that are purchased in prepackaged form, or (2) any amount received
by the practitioner in excess of the acquisition cost of a legend drug plus the cost of making the drug
available if the legend drug requires compounding, packaging, or other treatment. The statement
filed under this paragraph is public data under section 13.03. This paragraph does not apply to a
licensed doctor of veterinary medicine or a registered pharmacist. Any person other than a licensed
practitioner with the authority to prescribe, dispense, and administer a legend drug under paragraph
(a) shall not dispense for profit. To dispense for profit does not include dispensing by a community
health clinic when the profit from dispensing is used to meet operating expenses.

    For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008, and before January 1, 2011, all of the
percentage rates in this section are reduced by two-tenths of one percent, to 5.15, 6.85, and 7.65
percent. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010, all of the percentage rates in this
section are reduced by 35 hundredths of one percent, to 5, 6.7, and 7.5 percent.
    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and reduced by the Minnesota
assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses
(9), (10), (14), (15), and (16), after applying the allocation and assignability provisions of section
290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and

                 MAXIMUM HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX PROGRAM
   Section 1. [290D.01] MAXIMUM HOMESTEAD PROPERTY TAX PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Maximum homestead property tax. The property taxes payable by a qualified
taxpayer on a qualified homestead must not exceed the lesser of (1) the maximum tax amount
determined under subdivision 2, or (2) the amount otherwise provided by law without regard to
the provisions of this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Determination of maximum tax amount. The maximum tax amount is the amount
of property taxes payable in the base year, but increased by any tax amounts attributable to (1) an
increase after the base year in the square footage of the dwelling, (2) the market value of any other
improvements made after the base year exceeding 15 percent of the estimated market value of the
homestead for the assessment year prior to the year the improvements are initially assessed, or (3)
voter-approved levies exceeding the amount attributable to voter-approved levies in the base year.
   Sec. 2. [290D.02] DEFINITIONS.
   (a) For purposes of this chapter, the terms in this section have the meanings given them.
    (b) "Base year" means the taxes payable year in which the taxpayer is qualified and in which the
taxpayer has applied to the commissioner of revenue and been initially approved for the program
for taxes payable in the following year by the commissioner under section 290D.04.
   (c) "Property taxes payable" means the net property taxes payable on the qualified homestead
excluding special assessments, interest, and penalties, and before any refund under chapter 290A.

home and any other property used for purposes of a homestead as defined in section 273.13,
subdivisions 22 and 23, but not to exceed the immediately surrounding one acre of land in the case
of homestead property classified under section 273.13, subdivision 23. The homestead may be part
of a multidwelling building and the land on which it is built.
    (e) "Qualified taxpayer" means a person who meets the program participation requirements in
section 290D.03.
  Sec. 3. [290D.03] PROGRAM PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS; QUALIFIED
TAXPAYER.
    The qualifications for participation in the maximum homestead property tax program are as
follows:
    (1) the property must be owned and occupied as a homestead in a county that has approved the
program by a person 65 years of age or older. In the case of a married couple, both the spouses must
be at least 65 years old regardless of whether the property is titled in the name of one spouse or both
spouses, or titled in another way that permits the property to have homestead status;
    (2) the taxpayer's total household income, as defined in section 290A.03, subdivision 5, for the
calendar year preceding the year of the initial application may not exceed $60,000; and
    (3) the homestead must have been owned and occupied as the homestead of at least one of the
taxpayers for at least 25 years prior to the year the initial application is filed, regardless of whether
the property is titled in the name of one spouse or both spouses, or a surviving spouse, or titled in
any other way that permits the property to have homestead classification.
   Sec. 4. [290D.04] APPLICATION.
    Subdivision 1. Initial application. A qualified taxpayer may apply to the commissioner of
revenue for participation in the program. Applications are due on or before June 1 for taxes payable
the following year. A taxpayer may apply in the year in which the taxpayer becomes 65 years old.
The application, prescribed by the commissioner of revenue, must include:
   (1) the name, address, and Social Security number of the owner or owners;
   (2) a copy of the property tax statement for the current payable year for the homestead property;
   (3) the initial year of ownership and occupancy as a homestead;
   (4) the owner's household income for the previous calendar year; and
   (5) any other information the commissioner deems necessary.
    Subd. 2. Approval; notification. The commissioner shall approve an initial application
that qualifies under this chapter and shall notify the taxpayer on or before September 1. The
commissioner may investigate the facts or require confirmation in regard to an application.
    Subd. 3. Excess-income certification by taxpayer. The maximum tax amount does not apply
for any assessment year for a taxpayer whose total household income for the previous year exceeds
$60,000. A taxpayer whose initial application has been approved under subdivision 2 shall notify
the commissioner of revenue in writing by June 1 if the taxpayer's household income for the
87TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MARCH 6, 2008                                         7039

preceding calendar year exceeded $60,000. The certification must state the homeowner's total
household income for the previous calendar year. Participation in the program under this chapter is
not allowed in any year following the year in which a program participant filed or should have filed
an excess-income certification under this subdivision, unless the participant has filed a resumption
of eligibility certification as described in subdivision 4. On or before September 1 each year, the
commissioner shall notify the county auditor that the homestead no longer qualifies for a maximum
tax amount.
    Subd. 4. Resumption of eligibility certification by taxpayer. A taxpayer who has previously
filed an excess-income certification under subdivision 3 may resume program participation if the
taxpayer's household income for a subsequent year is $60,000 or less. If the taxpayer chooses to
resume program participation, the taxpayer must notify the commissioner of revenue in writing by
June 1 of the year following a calendar year in which the taxpayer's household income is $60,000
or less. The certification must state the taxpayer's total household income for the previous calendar
year. Once a taxpayer resumes participation in the program under this subdivision, participation
will continue until the taxpayer files a subsequent excess-income certification under subdivision 3 or
until participation is terminated under section 290D.06. On or before September 1, the commissioner
shall notify the county auditor that the homestead qualifies for the maximum tax amount certified
under section 290D.05, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 5. Penalty for failure to file excess-income certification; investigations. The
commissioner shall assess a penalty equal to 20 percent of the reduction in taxes in the case of a
false application, a false certification, or in the case of a required excess-income certification that
was not filed as of the applicable due date. The commissioner shall assess a penalty equal to 50
percent of the reduction in taxes if the taxpayer knowingly filed a false application or certification,
or knowingly failed to file a required excess-income certification by the applicable due date. The
commissioner shall assess penalties under this section through the issuance of an order under the
provisions of chapter 270C. Persons affected by a commissioner's order issued under this section
may appeal as provided in chapter 270C.
    (b) The commissioner may conduct investigations related to initial applications and
excess-income certifications required under this chapter within the period ending 3-1/2 years from
the due date of the application or certification.
  Sec. 5. [290D.05] CERTIFICATION BY COMMISSIONER; CALCULATION OF TAX,
TAX RATE, AND LEVY BY COUNTY AUDITOR.
    Subdivision 1. Commissioner certification. On or before September 1 of the year of initial
application, the commissioner of revenue shall certify to the county auditor of the county in which
the property is located (1) that the property qualifies for the maximum tax amount, (2) the base year,
and (3) the property taxes payable on the property in the base year.
   Subd. 2. County auditor calculations. Each year, the county auditor shall determine the
maximum homestead property tax amount for the property under section 290D.01. This is the
amount that must be used for the notice of proposed property taxes under section 275.065,
subdivision 3.
   Subd. 3. Adjustment of tax rate and levy. (a) If requested by the taxing jurisdiction, the county
auditor may estimate the total loss of revenue to the taxing jurisdiction for taxes levied in the current
year under this chapter and adjust the tax rate accordingly. If the adjustment to the tax rate is made
7040                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [87TH DAY

under this subdivision, in the following levy year the county auditor must adjust the levy of the
taxing district to compensate for the amount of variance between the estimated and actual loss of
revenues.
    (b) If an adjustment is not made under paragraph (a), a taxing jurisdiction may increase its levy
in the following year by the amount of any revenue loss under provisions of this chapter as certified
by the county auditor.
   (c) A levy adjustment under paragraph (a) or (b) is not subject to any levy limitations.
   Sec. 6. [290D.06] TERMINATION OF PROGRAM PARTICIPATION.
   Participation in the maximum homestead property tax program under this chapter terminates
when one of the following occurs:
   (1) the property is sold or transferred;
   (2) all qualifying homeowners have died;
    (3) the homeowner notifies the commissioner in writing that the homeowner cancels
participation in the program; or
   (4) the property no longer qualifies as a homestead.

    Subd. 8. Contingent reduction in tax rate. On September 1 of each odd-numbered year,
beginning September 1, 2009, the commissioner of finance shall determine the projected balance of
the health care access fund as of the end of the current biennium, based on the most recent February
forecast adjusted for any legislative session changes. If the commissioner of finance projects a
surplus in the health care access fund as of the end of the current biennium, the commissioner of
finance, in consultation with the commissioner, shall reduce the tax rates specified in subdivisions
1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4, in one-tenth of one percent increments, making the largest reduction in tax rates
consistent with ensuring that the health care access fund retains a surplus as of the end of the
current biennium. The reduced tax rates take effect on the January 1 that immediately follows the
September 1 on which the commissioner of finance determines the projected balance and remain
in effect for two tax years. The tax rates specified in subdivisions 1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4, apply for
subsequent tax years, unless the commissioner, based on a determination of the projected balance
of the health care access fund made on September 1 of an odd-numbered year, reduces the tax
rates. If the commissioner of finance does not project a surplus in the health care access fund as of
the end of the current biennium, the tax rates specified in subdivisions 1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4, continue
to apply. The commissioner of finance shall publish in the State Register by October 1 of each
odd-numbered year the amount of tax to be imposed for the next two calendar years."
