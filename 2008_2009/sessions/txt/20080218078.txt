appropriated for the purposes of county state
aids or municipal state aids, as appropriate.
If the appropriations under this subdivision
exhaust the balance in the fund from
which it is made in the year for which
it is made, the commissioner of finance
shall notify the chairs and ranking minority
members of the house of representatives
and senate committees with jurisdiction
over transportation finance of the amount by
which the appropriation exceeds the balance
and shall then reduce that amount from the
appropriation.

finance, the commissioner of transportation
may transfer unencumbered balances
among the appropriations from the trunk
highway fund and the state airports fund
made in this section. No transfer may be

   EFFECTIVE DATE. Appropriations for fiscal year 2008 are effective the day following final
enactment.
   Sec. 6. VALUE CAPTURE STUDY; APPROPRIATION.
    Subdivision 1. Findings. The legislature finds that large public investments in state
transportation infrastructure, such as constructing freeway interchanges, new highways, and rail
transit stations, can result in surrounding private land and other property increasing in value,
sometimes by substantial amounts. The special assessment law, Minnesota Statutes, chapter 429,
provides a method for local governments to use similar private or special benefits to help finance
local streets, roads, and other transportation improvements. However, the law does not provide the
state with a similar financing mechanism and the nature of a large state transportation project may
suggest that alternative financing mechanisms are more appropriate.
    Subd. 2. Appropriation; study. $325,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the Board of
Regents of the University of Minnesota for the Center for Transportation Studies to complete a study
to assess the public policy implications of financing new and improved transportation infrastructure
in Minnesota through capturing the value of the benefits created, to prepare a report on its findings,
and to conduct a series of workshops. This is a onetime appropriation and is available in fiscal years
2008 and 2009.
    Subd. 3. Report; workshops. The Center for Transportation Studies must report its preliminary
findings to the legislature by March 1, 2009, and must issue its full report by July 1, 2009. The Center
for Transportation must also offer a series of educational workshops for elected officials during the
summer and fall of 2009.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

            TRUNK HIGHWAY AND LOCAL ROAD AND BRIDGE BONDING
   Section 1. [296A.083] ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE SURCHARGE.
    (a) On June 30, 2008, and each March 1 thereafter, the commissioner of finance shall report to
the commissioner of revenue the amount of the trunk highway debt service transfer forecast in the
next two fiscal years attributable to the trunk highway bonds authorized in this article.
    (b) By July 16, 2008, and each April 1 thereafter, the commissioner of revenue shall compute
and publish a surcharge for each fuel tax provided for in sections 296A.07, subdivision 3, and
296A.08, subdivision 2, in proportion to the rate of tax for each type of fuel. The surcharge must
be calculated to raise an amount of money which, when added to the balance in the trunk highway
debt service account, covers the debt service transfer forecast in the next two fiscal years, except
that the surcharge may not exceed 2.5 cents per gallon for gasoline taxed under section 296A.07,
subdivision 3, clause (3), or a proportional rate for each other type of fuel. The surcharge must be
rounded to the nearest 0.1 cent. The surcharge is effective on August 1, 2008, to June 30, 2009, and
each new surcharge thereafter is effective the following July 1 to June 30.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   (b) Subject to the classification provisions herein, "base value" means the manufacturer's
suggested retail price of the vehicle including destination charge using list price information
published by the manufacturer or determined by the registrar if no suggested retail price exists, and
shall not include the cost of each accessory or item of optional equipment separately added to the

evidenced by a certificate of cost but not including Minnesota sales or use tax or any local sales or
other local tax.
      (e) The registrar shall classify every vehicle in its proper base value class as follows:

and thereafter a series of classes successively set in brackets having a spread of $200 consisting of
such number of classes as will permit classification of all vehicles.
    (f) The base value for purposes of this section shall be the middle point between the extremes
of its class.
    (g) The registrar shall establish the base value, when new, of every passenger automobile and
hearse registered prior to the effective date of Extra Session Laws 1971, chapter 31, using list
price information published by the manufacturer or any nationally recognized firm or association
compiling such data for the automotive industry. If unable to ascertain the base value of any
registered vehicle in the foregoing manner, the registrar may use any other available source or
method. The registrar shall calculate tax using base value information available to dealers and
deputy registrars at the time the application for registration is submitted. The tax on all previously
registered vehicles shall be computed upon the base value thus determined taking into account the
depreciation provisions of paragraph (h).
     (h) The annual additional tax must be computed upon a percentage of the base value as p        ­­ r­

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 34. Lower income motor fuels tax credit. (a) An individual who has attained the age of
18 by the end of the taxable year and cannot be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return
may take a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter. For married couples filing joint returns,
surviving spouses, single filers, and head of household filers, the credit amount is $25. For married
individuals filing separate returns, the credit amount is $12.50. To qualify, the individual's taxable net
income for the taxable year must not exceed the maximum amount for the individual's filing status,
adjusted as provided in subdivision 2d, that is taxable at the lowest rate under subdivision 2c. For
individuals with taxable net income that exceeds the amount of income taxable for the individual's
filing status at the lowest rate under subdivision 2c, adjusted as provided in subdivision 2d, the credit
amount is zero. For a nonresident or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the
percentage calculated under subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).
    (b) If the amount of the credit which the individual is eligible to receive under this subdivision
exceeds the individual's liability for tax under this chapter, the commissioner of revenue shall refund
the excess.
   (c) The amount necessary to pay claims for the refund provided in this section is appropriated
from the general fund to the commissioner.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2008.

the form required by the commissioner. Upon receipt of the request, the commissioner shall appoint
a board consisting of two representatives of the counties, who must be either a county engineer or
member of a county board, from counties other than the requesting county, and a representative of the
commissioner. The board shall investigate the matter and report its findings and recommendations
in writing to the commissioner.

the commissioner shall certify to the commissioner of finance the amount of the aid, and the
commissioner of finance shall then issue a warrant in that amount payable to the county treasurer of
the county. Money so paid must be expended on the county state-aid highway system in accordance

county state-aid highway system under Minnesota Statutes 1961, section 162.02, subdivision 6,
which border and provide substantial access to an outdoor recreation unit as defined in section
86A.04 or which provide access to the headquarters of or the principal parking lot located within
such a unit, and (2) the reconstruction, improvement, repair, and maintenance of county roads, city
streets, and town roads that provide access to public lakes, rivers, state parks, and state campgrounds.
Roads described in clause (2) are not required to meet county state-aid highway standards. At the
request of the commissioner of natural resources the counties wherein such roads are located shall
do such work as requested in the same manner as on any county state-aid highway and shall be
reimbursed for such construction, reconstruction, or improvements from the amount set aside by
this subdivision. Before requesting a county to do work on a county state-aid highway as provided
in this subdivision, the commissioner of natural resources must obtain approval for the project from
the County State-Aid Screening Board. The screening board, before giving its approval, must obtain
a written comment on the project from the county engineer of the county requested to undertake the
project. Before requesting a county to do work on a county road, city street, or a town road that
provides access to a public lake, a river, a state park, or a state campground, the commissioner of
natural resources shall obtain a written comment on the project from the county engineer of the
county requested to undertake the project. Any sums paid to counties or cities in accordance with
this subdivision shall reduce the money needs of said counties or cities in the amounts necessary
to equalize their status with those counties or cities not receiving such payments. Any balance of
the amount so set aside, at the end of each year shall be transferred to the county state-aid highway
fund.

revolving loan account is created in the transportation revolving loan fund. The commissioner
may transfer to the account the amount allocated under section 162.065. Money in the account
may be used to make loans. Funds in the county state-aid highway revolving loan account may be
used only for aid in the construction, improvement, and maintenance of county state-aid highways.
Funds in the account may not be used for any toll facilities project or congestion-pricing project.
Repayments and interest from loans from the county state-aid highway revolving loan account must
be credited to that account. Money in the account is annually appropriated to the commissioner and
does not lapse. Interest earned from investment of money in this account must be deposited in the
county state-aid highway revolving loan account.

county state-aid highways. In 1997 and subsequent years no county may receive, as a result of an
apportionment under this clause based on lane-miles rather than miles of approved county state-aid
highways, an apportionment that is less than its apportionment in 1996.

several counties so that each county shall receive of such amount the percentage that its money needs
bears to the sum of the money needs of all of the individual counties; provided, that the percentage
of such amount that each county is to receive shall be adjusted so that each county shall receive in
1958 a total apportionment at least ten percent greater than its total 1956 apportionments from the
state road and bridge fund; and provided further that those counties whose money needs are thus
adjusted shall never receive a percentage of the apportionment sum less than the percentage that
such county received in 1958.

account, and state park road account.
   (b) The apportionment sum is calculated by subtracting the excess sum, as calculated in
paragraph (c), from the distribution amount.
   (c) The excess sum is calculated as the sum of revenue within the distribution amount:
    (1) attributed to that portion of the gasoline excise tax rate under section 296A.07, subdivision
3, in excess of 20 cents per gallon, and to that portion of the excise tax rates in excess of the
energy equivalent of a gasoline excise tax rate of 20 cents per gallon for E85 and M85 under section
296A.07, subdivision 3, and special fuel under section 296A.08, subdivision 2;
   (2) attributed to a change in the passenger vehicle registration tax under section 168.013,
imposed on or after July 1, 2008, that exceeds (i) the amount collected in fiscal year 2008,
multiplied by (ii) the annual average United States Consumer Price Index for the calendar year
previous to the current calendar year, divided by the annual average United States Consumer Price
Index for calendar year 2007; and
    (3) attributed to that portion of the motor vehicle sales tax revenue in excess of the percentage
allocated to the county state-aid highway fund in fiscal year 2007.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, the United States Consumer Price Index identified in
paragraph (c) is for all urban consumers, United States city average, as determined by the United
States Department of Labor.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 162.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1c. Excess sum. (a) The commissioner shall apportion the excess sum, as calculated in
subdivision 1a, to the several counties as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c).
   (b) An amount equal to 40 percent must be apportioned among the several counties so that each
county receives of that amount the percentage that its motor vehicle registration for the calendar
year preceding the one last past, determined by residence of registrants, bears to the total statewide
motor vehicle registration.
   (c) An amount equal to 60 percent must be apportioned among the several counties so that each
county receives of that amount the percentage that its money needs bears to the sum of the money
needs of all of the individual counties.

    (d) Money that will be used for the restoration of trunk highways that have reverted or that will
revert to cities must be deposited in the municipal turnback account, which is created in the state
treasury.
    (e) Money that will be used for the restoration of trunk highways that have reverted or that will
revert to counties must be deposited in the county turnback account, which is created in the state
treasury.
    (f) Money that will be used for safety improvements must be deposited in the highway safety
improvement account, which is created in the state treasury to be used as grants to statutory or home
rule charter cities, towns, and counties to assist in paying the costs of constructing or reconstructing
city streets, county highways, or town roads to reduce crashes, deaths, injuries, and property damage.
    (g) Money that will be used for routes of regional significance must be deposited in the routes of
regional significance account, which is created in the state treasury, and used as grants to statutory
or home rule charter cities, towns, and counties to assist in paying the costs of constructing or
reconstructing city streets, county highways, or town roads with statewide or regional significance
that have not been fully funded through other state, federal, or local funding sources.
    (h) As part of each biennial budget submission to the legislature, the commissioner shall describe
how the money in the flexible highway account will be apportioned among the county turnback

    Sec. 5. [165.14] TRUNK HIGHWAY BRIDGE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Definition. For purposes of this section, "program" means the trunk highway
bridge improvement program established under this section.
    Subd. 2. Program created. The commissioner shall develop a trunk highway bridge
improvement program for accelerating repair and replacement of trunk highway bridges throughout
the state. The program receives funding for bridge projects as specified by law.
    Subd. 3. Program requirements. (a) The commissioner shall develop an inventory of bridges
included in the program. The inventory must include all bridges on the trunk highway system in
Minnesota that are classified as fracture-critical or structurally deficient, or constitute a priority
project, as identified by the commissioner. In determining whether a bridge is a priority project, the
commissioner may consider national bridge inventory (NBI) condition codes, bridge classification
as functionally obsolete, the year in which the bridge was built, the history of bridge maintenance and
inspection report findings, the average daily traffic count, engineering judgments with respect to the
safety or condition of the bridge, and any other factors specifically identified by the commissioner.
78TH DAY]                          MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2008                                            6553

    (b) For each bridge included in the inventory, the commissioner must provide the following
information: a summary of the bridge, including but not limited to, county and department district,
route number, feature crossed, the year in which the bridge was built, average daily traffic count,
load rating, bridge length and deck area, and main span type; the condition ratings for the deck,
superstructure, and substructure; identification of whether the bridge is structurally deficient,
functionally obsolete, or fracture-critical; the sufficiency rating; a brief description of the work
planned for the bridge, including work type needed; an estimate of total costs related to the bridge,
which may include general and planning cost estimates; and, the year or range of years in which
the work is planned.
    Subd. 4. Prioritization of bridge projects. (a) The commissioner shall classify all bridges in
the program into tier 1, 2, or 3 bridges, where tier 1 is the highest tier. Unless the commissioner
identifies a reason for proceeding otherwise, before commencing bridge projects in a lower tier, all
bridge projects within a higher tier must to the extent feasible be selected and funded in the approved
state transportation improvement program, at any stage in the project development process, solicited
for bids, in contract negotiation, under construction, or completed.
    (b) The classification of each tier is as follows:
    (1) tier 1 consists of any bridge in the program that (i) has an average daily traffic count
that is above 1,000 and has a sufficiency rating that is at or below 50, or (ii) is identified by the
commissioner as a priority project;
    (2) tier 2 consists of any bridge that is not a tier 1 bridge, and (i) is classified as fracture-critical,
or (ii) has a sufficiency rating that is at or below 80; and
    (3) tier 3 consists of any other bridge in the program that is not a tier 1 or tier 2 bridge.
   (c) By June 30, 2018, all tier 1 and tier 2 bridges originally included in the program must be under
contract for repair or replacement with a new bridge that contains a load-path-redundant design,
except that a specific bridge may remain in continued service if the reasons are documented in the
report required under subdivision 5.
   (d) The commissioner shall establish criteria for determining the priority of bridge projects
within each tier, and must include safety considerations as a criterion.
    Subd. 5. Statewide transportation planning report. In conjunction with each update to the
Minnesota statewide transportation plan, or at least every six years, the commissioner shall submit
a report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the house of representatives and senate
committees with jurisdiction over transportation finance. The report must include:
   (1) an explanation of the criteria and decision-making processes used to prioritize bridge
projects;
    (2) a historical and projected analysis of the extent to which all trunk highway bridges meet
bridge performance targets;
    (3) a summary of bridge projects (i) completed in the previous six years or since the last update
to the Minnesota statewide transportation plan, and (ii) currently in progress under the program;
    (4) a summary of bridge projects scheduled in the next four fiscal years and included in the state

transportation improvement program;
    (5) a projection of annual needs over the next 20 years;
    (6) a calculation funding necessary to meet the completion date under subdivision 4, paragraph
(c), compared to the total amount of bridge-related funding available; and
    (8) for any tier 1 fracture-critical bridge that is repaired but not replaced, an explanation of the
reasons for repair instead of replacement.
    Subd. 6. Annual report. Annually by January 15, the commissioner shall submit a report on
the program to the chairs and ranking minority members of the house of representatives and senate
committees with jurisdiction over transportation finance. The report must include the inventory
information required under subdivision 3, and an analysis, including any recommendations for
changes, of the adequacy and efficacy of (1) the program requirements under subdivision 3, and (2)
the prioritization requirements under subdivision 4.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   (1) Twenty percent must be credited to the driver services operating account in the special
revenue fund as specified in section 299A.705.
    (2) Sixty-seven percent must be credited to the general fund.
    (3) Eight percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension account. Money in this account may be appropriated to the commissioner of public
safety and the appropriated amount must be apportioned 80 percent for laboratory costs and 20
percent for carrying out the provisions of section 299C.065.
   (4) Five percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the vehicle forfeiture
account, which is created in the special revenue fund. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner for costs of handling vehicle forfeitures.

surcharge on a reinstatement under paragraph (f) is credited from the first installment payment to
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury account. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner of health to be used as follows: 83 percent for contracts with a
qualified community-based organization to provide information, resources, and support to assist
persons with traumatic brain injury and their families to access services, and 17 percent to maintain
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registry created in section 144.662. For the

purposes of this paragraph, a "qualified community-based organization" is a private, not-for-profit
organization of consumers of traumatic brain injury services and their family members. The
organization must be registered with the United States Internal Revenue Service under section
501(c)(3) as a tax-exempt organization and must have as its purposes:
   (1) the promotion of public, family, survivor, and professional awareness of the incidence and
consequences of traumatic brain injury;
   (2) the provision of a network of support for persons with traumatic brain injury, their families,
and friends;
   (3) the development and support of programs and services to prevent traumatic brain injury;
   (4) the establishment of education programs for persons with traumatic brain injury; and
   (5) the empowerment of persons with traumatic brain injury through participation in its
governance.
A patient's name, identifying information, or identifiable medical data must not be disclosed to the
organization without the informed voluntary written consent of the patient or patient's guardian or,
if the patient is a minor, of the parent or guardian of the patient.
    (d) The remainder of the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be known as the
remote electronic alcohol-monitoring program account. The commissioner shall transfer the balance
of this account to the commissioner of finance on a monthly basis for deposit in the general fund.
    (e) When these fees are collected by a licensing agent, appointed under section 171.061, a
handling charge is imposed in the amount specified under section 171.061, subdivision 4. The
reinstatement fees and surcharge must be deposited in an approved depository as directed under
section 171.061, subdivision 4.
    (f) A person whose driver's license has been revoked as provided in subdivision 1 under section
169A.52 or 169A.54 and who the court certifies as being financially eligible for a public defender
under section 611.17, may choose to pay 50 percent and an additional $25 of the total amount of the
surcharge and 50 percent of the fee required under paragraph (b) to reinstate the person's driver's
license, provided the person meets all other requirements of reinstatement. If a person chooses to
pay 50 percent of the total and an additional $25, the driver's license must expire after two years. The
person must pay an additional 50 percent less $25 of the total to extend the license for an additional
two years, provided the person is otherwise still eligible for the license. After this final payment
of the surcharge and fee, the license may be renewed on a standard schedule, as provided under
section 171.27. A handling charge may be imposed for each installment payment. Revenue from
the handling charge is credited to the driver services operating account in the special revenue fund
and is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any person making installment payments under paragraph (f), whose driver's license
subsequently expires, or is canceled, revoked, or suspended before payment of 100 percent of the
surcharge and fee, must pay the outstanding balance due for the initial reinstatement before the
driver's license is subsequently reinstated. Upon payment of the outstanding balance due for the
initial reinstatement, the person may pay any new surcharge and fee imposed under paragraph (b)
in installment payments as provided under paragraph (f).
