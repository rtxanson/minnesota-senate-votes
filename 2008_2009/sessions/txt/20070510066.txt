The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 65, Senate File 1989, the Omnibus Higher Education
3928                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [66TH DAY

Funding Act.
I appreciate the efforts by the conferees and committee chairs to develop a comprehensive funding
proposal for higher education this session. However, as I have made clear on numerous occasions,
without an agreement on the overall state budget, which includes consideration of available
revenues and expenditures, it is irresponsible to sign a bill of this magnitude. This bill creates
ongoing expenses of $416 million dollars which is $95 million dollars over my administration's
budget recommendations in the 2010-2011 budget period. Committing to this level of spending in
this bill will severely limit the funds available for other priorities such as K-12 education.
I also want to express my disappointment that Senate File 1989 does not include a key initiative
from our budget proposal, the ACHIEVE program. This program would encourage Minnesota
high school students to take rigorous courses to prepare for college by rewarding them with
scholarship funds for completing such courses. Building on the success of existing academic and
grant programs, the ACHIEVE program would begin to address the academic and financial access
needs of a broad spectrum of students. It will also create tangible reform in our high schools
by providing a direct incentive for students to adequately prepare for college. We modified our
ACHIEVE proposal in response to concerns expressed by legislators throughout the process. It is
doubtful that the "alternative" proposal included in this bill would have any significant impact on
the state's future workforce and global competitiveness.
I am also disappointed that the Legislature included a significant number of special interest projects
at particular campuses rather than providing the Board of Trustees for the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities with greater flexibility in determining the best and highest uses for the funds.
I strongly believe that basing funding on progress toward meeting strategic goals will achieve
greater efficiency and accountability in the use of public funds. I am also disappointed that this
bill would reduce the Boards' current flexibility for competitive compensation. This limitation on
Board authority should be eliminated. Finally, I do not support the creation of a new construction
surcharge that would be applied broadly to all non-residential construction permits in the state as a
means to fund a particular type of educational program at public postsecondary institutions.
Finally, I do not agree with the changes this bill makes to designate specific "union" and "business"
positions on the Board of Trustees for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. The current
provisions allow for wide diversity on the Board. To further engage interest groups in these important
board appointments would encourage more parochial advocacy and may hinder the Board's ability
to be collaborative and flexible.
Although I am pleased that this bill includes some assistance to our students who are military
veterans in the form of a Minnesota GI Bill, the amount of funding for this program is only one-third
of our proposal. I believe our returning veterans deserve better. I also appreciate that the Legislature
dropped language proposed earlier that would have mandated that public institutions offer resident
tuition rates to illegal immigrants.
I would like to finalize a higher education bill that strengthens our public systems and supports
quality, choice, and access for students. However, it is essential that such a bill incorporate an
affordable level of future spending commitments. We look forward to working with you in the
coming days to reach a compromise acceptable to all.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
