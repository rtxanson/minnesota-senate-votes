limited to, any damage or breakdown not covered by the service contract. Service contracts may
cover damage resulting from rust, corrosion, or damage caused by a noncovered part or system."

signed by the agent or broker as to whether the agent or broker knows replacement is or may be
involved in the transaction.
   (b) Where a replacement is involved:
    (1) require from the agent or broker with the application for life insurance or annuity, a copy
of the fully completed and signed replacement notice provided the applicant under section 61A.55.
The existing life insurance or annuity must be identified by name of insurer, insured, and contract
number. If a number has not been assigned by the existing insurer, alternative identification, such
as an application or receipt number, must be listed; and
    (2) send to each existing insurer a written communication advising of the replacement or
proposed replacement and the identification information obtained under this section. This written
communication must be made within five working days of the date that the application is received
in the replacing insurer's home or regional office, or the date the proposed policy or contract is
issued, whichever is sooner.
    (c) The replacing insurer shall maintain evidence of the "notice regarding replacement" and a
replacement register, cross-indexed, by replacing agent and existing insurer to be replaced. Evidence
that all requirements were met shall be maintained for at least six years.

    (d) The replacing insurer shall provide in its policy or contract, or in a separate written notice
that is delivered with the policy or contract, that the applicant has a right to an unconditional refund
of all premiums paid, which right may be exercised within a period of 2     ­0­ 30 days beginning from
the date of delivery of the policy."

read:
    Subdivision 1. Inflation protection feature. (a) No insurer may offer a long-term care insurance
policy unless the insurer also offers to the policyholder, in addition to any other inflation protection,
the option to purchase a policy that provides for benefit levels to increase with benefit maximums
or reasonable durations which are meaningful to account for reasonably anticipated increases in
the costs of long-term care services covered by the policy. In addition to other options that may be
offered, insurers must offer to each policyholder, at the time of purchase, the option to purchase a
policy with an inflation protection feature no less favorable than one of the following:
    (1) increases benefit levels annually in a manner so that the increases are compounded annually
at a rate not less than five percent;
    (2) guarantees the insured individual the right to periodically increase benefit levels without
providing evidence of insurability or health status so long as the option for the previous period has
not been declined. The amount of the additional benefit shall be no less than the difference between
the existing policy benefit and that benefit compounded annually at a rate of at least five percent for
the period beginning with the purchase of the existing benefit and extending until the year in which
the offer is made; or
  (3) covers a specified percentage of actual or reasonable charges and does not include a
maximum specified indemnity amount or limit.
   (b) A long-term care partnership policy must provide the inflation protection described in this
subdivision. If the policy is sold to an individual who:
    (1) has not attained age 61 as of the date of purchase, the policy must provide compound annual
inflation protection;
    (2) has attained age 61, but has not attained age 76 as of such date, the policy must provide some
level of inflation protection; and
    (3) has attained the age of 76 as of such date, the policy may, but is not required to, provide some
level of inflation protection.
    Inflation protection for a long-term care partnership policy may not be less than three percent
per year or a rate based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. The commissioner, however, may
approve other types of inflation protection that comply with this section and further the goals of the
partnership program."

    Subd. 2. Life insurance companies. (a) Unless otherwise approved by the commissioner of
commerce, a domestic mutual life insurance company member is any person who is listed on the
records of the company as the owner of an in-force policy, and each member is entitled to one vote
regardless of the number of policies owned by the member or the amounts of coverage provided to
the member. For purposes of this section, "policy" means a policy or contract of insurance, including
an annuity contract issued by the company, but excluding individual noncontributory insurance
policies for which the premiums are paid by a financial institution, association, employer, or other
institutional entity. Except as otherwise provided in the company's certificate or bylaws, a person
covered under a group policy is not a member by virtue of such coverage, except that a person
insured under a group life insurance policy is a member if: (1) the person is insured under a group
life policy under which cash value has accumulated and ­   b­

deposits for the policy.
   (b) Every member of a mutual life insurance company must be notified of its annual meetings by
a written notice mailed to the member's address, or by an imprint on the front or back of the policy,
premium notice, receipt, or certificate of renewal, substantially as follows:
    "The policyowner is hereby notified that by virtue of his or her ownership of this policy, the
policyowner is a member of the .......... Insurance Company, and that the annual meetings of said
company are held at its home office on the .... day of .... in each year, at .... o'clock."
    For mutual life insurance holding companies, the notice of the annual meeting may be modified
to reflect that the policyowner, by virtue of his or her ownership of a policy issued by a subsidiary
insurance company reorganized under section 66A.40, is a member of the mutual insurance holding
company. Notice given in this manner is deemed to comply with the requirements of section
302A.435."

becomes effective.
    The insurer must return all payments made for this policy within ten days after it receives
notice of cancellation and the returned policy. For variable annuity contracts issued pursuant to
sections 61A.13 to 61A.21, this notice shall be suitably modified so as to notify the purchaser that
the purchaser is entitled to a refund of the amount calculated in accordance with the provisions
of section 72A.51, subdivision 3. For variable life insurance policies, this notice must be suitably
modified so as to notify the purchaser that the purchaser is entitled to a refund of: (i) the premiums
paid; or (ii) the variable account value plus any amount deducted from the portion of the premium
applied to the account.
    Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 79A.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Private employers who have ceased to be self-insured. (a) Private employers who
have ceased to be private self-insurers shall discharge their continuing obligations to secure the
payment of compensation which is accrued during the period of self-insurance, for purposes of Laws
1988, chapter 674, sections 1 to 21, by compliance with all of the following obligations of current
certificate holders:
    (1) Filing reports with the commissioner to carry out the requirements of this chapter;
    (2) Depositing and maintaining a security deposit for accrued liability for the payment of any
compensation which may become due, pursuant to chapter 176. However, if a private employer
who has ceased to be a private self-insurer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer authorized
to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state which provides coverage of all claims
for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the entire period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period, the policy will:
    (i) discharge the obligation of the employer to maintain a security deposit for the payment of the
claims covered under the policy;
    (ii) discharge any obligation which the self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment
of all claims for compensation arising out of injuries occurring during the period the employer was
self-insured, whether or not reported during that period; and
   (iii) discharge the obligations of the employer to pay any future assessments to the self-insurers'
security fund.
    A private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may instead buy an insurance
policy described above, except that it covers only a portion of the period of time during which
the private employer was self-insured; purchase of such a policy discharges any obligation that the
self-insurers' security fund has or may have for payment of all claims for compensation arising out of
injuries occurring during the period for which the policy provides coverage, whether or not reported
during that period.
90TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2008                                         7297

   A policy described in this clause may not be issued by an insurer unless it has previously been
approved as to form and substance by the commissioner; and
    (3) Paying within 30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund, for a
period of seven years from the last day its certificate of self-insurance was in effect. Thereafter, the
private employer who has ceased to be a private self-insurer may either: (i) continue to pay within
30 days all assessments of which notice is sent by the security fund until it has no incurred liabilities
for the payment of compensation arising out of injuries during the period of self-insurance; or (ii)
pay the security fund a cash payment equal to four percent of the net present value of all remaining
incurred liabilities for the payment of compensation under sections 176.101 and 176.111 as certified
by a member of the casualty actuarial society. Assessments shall be based on the benefits paid by the
employer during the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the employer's
right to self-insure is terminated or withdrawn.
    (b) With respect to a self-insurer who terminates its self-insurance authority after April 1, 1998,
that member shall obtain and file with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding
liabilities as determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society within 120
days of the date of its termination. If the actuarial opinion is not timely filed, the self-insurers'
security fund may, at its discretion, engage the services of an actuary for this purpose. The expense
of this actuarial opinion must be assessed against and be the obligation of the self-insurer. The
commissioner may issue a certificate of default against the self-insurer for failure to pay this
assessment to the self-insurers' security fund as provided by section 79A.04, subdivision 9. The
opinion must separate liability for indemnity benefits from liability from medical benefits, and must
discount each up to four percent per annum to net present value. Within 30 days after notification
of approval of the actuarial opinion by the commissioner, the member shall pay to the security
fund an amount equal to 120 percent of that discounted outstanding indemnity liability, multiplied
by the greater of the average annualized assessment rate since inception of the security fund or
the annual rate at the time of the most recent assessment before termination. If the payment is not
made within 30 days of the notification, interest on it at the rate prescribed by section 549.09 must
be paid by the former member to the security fund until the principal amount is paid in full.
    (c) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, who
has paid assessments to the self-insurers' security fund for seven years, and whose annualized
assessment is ­$5­0
                  ­0­ $15,000 or less, may buy out of its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers'
security fund by an amount calculated as follows: 1.35 multiplied by the indemnity case reserves
at the time of the calculation, multiplied by the then current self-insurers' security fund annualized
assessment rate.
    (d) A former member who terminated its self-insurance authority before April 1, 1998, and who
is paying assessments within the first seven years after ceasing to be self-insured under paragraph
(a), clause (3), may elect to buy out its outstanding liabilities to the self-insurers' security fund
by obtaining and filing with the commissioner an actuarial opinion of its outstanding liabilities as
determined by an associate or fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society. The opinion must separate
liability for indemnity benefits from liability for medical benefits, and must discount each up to four
percent per annum to net present value. Within 30 days after notification of approval of the actuarial
opinion by the commissioner, the member shall pay to the security fund an amount equal to 120
percent of that discounted outstanding indemnity liability, multiplied by the greater of the average
annualized assessment rate since inception of the security fund or the annual rate at the time of the

most recent assessment.
    (e) A former member who has paid the security fund according to paragraphs (b) to (d) and
subsequently receives authority from the commissioner to again self-insure shall be assessed under
section 79A.12, subdivision 2, only on indemnity benefits paid on injuries that occurred after the
former member received authority to self-insure again; provided that the member furnishes verified
data regarding those benefits to the security fund.
    (f) In addition to proceedings to establish liabilities and penalties otherwise provided, a failure
to comply may be the subject of a proceeding before the commissioner. An appeal from the
commissioner's determination may be taken pursuant to the contested case procedures of chapter
14 within 30 days of the commissioner's written determination.
    Any current or past member of the self-insurers' security fund is subject to service of process
on any claim arising out of chapter 176 or this chapter in the manner provided by section 5.25, or
as otherwise provided by law. The issuance of a certificate to self-insure to the private self-insured
employer shall be deemed to be the agreement that any process which is served in accordance with
this section shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served personally within this state.
   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 79A.22, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. New membership. The commercial self-insurance group shall file with the
commissioner the name of any new employer that has been accepted in the group ­     p­i­­
                                                                                     r­o r­­o

five business days of the initiation date of membership along with the member's signed indemnity
agreement and evidence the member has deposited sufficient premiums with the group as required
by the commercial self-insurance group's bylaws or plan of operation. The security deposit of the
group shall be increased quarterly to an amount equal to 50 percent of the new members' premiums
for that quarter. If the total increase of new members' premiums for the first quarter is less than
five percent of the total annual premium of the group, no quarterly increase is necessary until the
cumulative quarterly increases for that calendar year exceed five percent of the total premium of
the group. The commissioner may, at the commissioner's option, review the financial statement of
any applicant whose premium equals 25 percent or more of the group's total premium.
   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 79A.22, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Commercial self-insurance group common claims fund. (a) Each commercial
self-insurance group shall establish a common claims fund.
    (b) Each commercial self-insurance group shall, not less than ten days prior to the proposed
effective date of the group, collect cash premiums from each member equal to not less than 20
percent of the member's annual workers' compensation premium to be paid into a common claims
fund, maintained by the group in a designated depository. The remaining balance of the member's
premium shall be paid to the group in a reasonable manner over the remainder of the year. Payments
in subsequent years shall be made according to the business plan.
  (c) Each commercial self-insurance group shall initiate proceedings against a member when that
member becomes more than ­ 15
                            ­ 30 days delinquent in any payment of premium to the fund.
    (d) There shall be no commingling of any assets of the common claims fund with the assets of
any individual member or with any other account of the service company or fiscal agent unrelated
to the payment of workers' compensation liabilities incurred by the group.

   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 79A.23, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Required reports from members to group. (a) Each member of the commercial
self-insurance group shall, by September 15, submit to the group its most recent annual financial
statement, together with other financial information the group may require. These financial
statements submitted must not have a fiscal year end date older than January 15 of the group's
calendar year end. Individual group members constituting at least 25 percent of the group's annual
premium shall submit to the group reviewed or audited financial statements. The remaining
members must submit compilation level statements.
    (b) For groups that have been in existence for at least three years, individual group members may
satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) by submitting compiled, reviewed, or audited statements
or the most recent federal income tax return filed by the member.
    (c) Groups that have been in existence for at least five years may satisfy the requirement of
paragraph (a) through submissions from members representing at least 50 percent of the group's
total earned premium. Of those submissions, those from members representing at least 25 percent
of the entire group's total earned premium must be audited or reviewed financial statements. The
remainder of the submissions may be compiled, reviewed, or audited financial statements or the
most recent tax return filed by the members."

by promoting, in the most practicable way possible, the use of energy sources and waste disposal
methods which produce or emit the least air contaminants consistent with the agency's overall goal
of reducing all forms of pollution. The agency shall also adopt standards of air quality, including
maximum allowable standards of emission of air contaminants from motor vehicles, recognizing
that due to variable factors, no single standard of purity of air is applicable to all areas of the state.
In adopting standards the Pollution Control Agency shall give due recognition to the fact that the
quantity or characteristics of air contaminants or the duration of their presence in the atmosphere,
which may cause air pollution in one area of the state, may cause less or not cause any air pollution

in another area of the state, and it shall take into consideration in this connection such factors,
including others which it may deem proper, as existing physical conditions, zoning classifications,
topography, prevailing wind directions and velocities, and the fact that a standard of air quality
which may be proper as to an essentially residential area of the state, may not be proper as to a
highly developed industrial area of the state. Such standards of air quality shall be premised upon
scientific knowledge of causes as well as effects based on technically substantiated criteria and
commonly accepted practices. No local government unit shall set standards of air quality which are
more stringent than those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
    (b) The Pollution Control Agency shall adopt rules, as authorized under the federal Clean Air
Act, United States Code, title 42, section 7507, to regulate emission standards of motor vehicles
sold in this state. The rules:
   (1) must be adopted under section 14.388, subdivision 1, clause (3);
    (2) except as provided in clause (3), must be identical to and must incorporate by reference the
California low emission vehicle regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board under
the California Code of Regulations, title 13;
   (3) must not include the zero emission vehicle standards contained in California Code of
Regulations, title 13, section 1962; and
   (4) must be amended as necessary in a timely fashion to minimize the time during which
Minnesota's rules are not identical with California's regulations, as required under United States
Code, title 42, section 7507. Amendments under this clause must be made under section 14.388,
subdivision 1, clause (3).
The rules shall apply to motor vehicles approved by the National Safety Board for on-road use as
passenger vehicles on state and county highways and interstate freeways.
    If the California regulations are extended to off-road vehicles or engines including, but not
limited to, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, boats, aircraft, lawnmowers, or tractors, this section
is no longer effective, and Minnesota opts for the federal motor vehicle emissions standards by
operation of law without requiring further executive or legislative branch action.
   Any portion of California's regulations requiring a federal waiver under the Clean Air Act in
order to become effective may not be enforced in Minnesota unless and until California receives the
requisite federal waiver.
    (c) The Pollution Control Agency shall promote solid waste disposal control by encouraging
the updating of collection systems, elimination of open dumps, and improvements in incinerator
practices. The agency shall also adopt standards for the control of the collection, transportation,
storage, processing, and disposal of solid waste and sewage sludge for the prevention and abatement
of water, air, and land pollution, recognizing that due to variable factors, no single standard of control
is applicable to all areas of the state. In adopting standards, the Pollution Control Agency shall give
due recognition to the fact that elements of control which may be reasonable and proper in densely
populated areas of the state may be unreasonable and improper in sparsely populated or remote
areas of the state, and it shall take into consideration in this connection such factors, including others
which it may deem proper, as existing physical conditions, topography, soils and geology, climate,
transportation, and land use. Such standards of control shall be premised on technical criteria and

commonly accepted practices.
    (d) The Pollution Control Agency shall also adopt standards describing the maximum levels of
noise in terms of sound pressure level which may occur in the outdoor atmosphere, recognizing that
due to variable factors no single standard of sound pressure is applicable to all areas of the state.
Such standards shall give due consideration to such factors as the intensity of noises, the types of
noises, the frequency with which noises recur, the time period for which noises continue, the times
of day during which noises occur, and such other factors as could affect the extent to which noises
may be injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or could interfere
unreasonably with the enjoyment of life or property. In adopting standards, the Pollution Control
Agency shall give due recognition to the fact that the quantity or characteristics of noise or the
duration of its presence in the outdoor atmosphere, which may cause noise pollution in one area of
the state, may cause less or not cause any noise pollution in another area of the state, and it shall
take into consideration in this connection such factors, including others which it may deem proper,
as existing physical conditions, zoning classifications, topography, meteorological conditions and
the fact that a standard which may be proper in an essentially residential area of the state, may
not be proper as to a highly developed industrial area of the state. Such noise standards shall be
premised upon scientific knowledge as well as effects based on technically substantiated criteria and
commonly accepted practices. No local governing unit shall set standards describing the maximum
levels of sound pressure which are more stringent than those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
    (e) The Pollution Control Agency shall adopt standards for the identification of hazardous waste
and for the management, identification, labeling, classification, storage, collection, transportation,
processing, and disposal of hazardous waste, recognizing that due to variable factors, a single
standard of hazardous waste control may not be applicable to all areas of the state. In adopting
standards, the Pollution Control Agency shall recognize that elements of control which may be
reasonable and proper in densely populated areas of the state may be unreasonable and improper
in sparsely populated or remote areas of the state. The agency shall consider existing physical
conditions, topography, soils, and geology, climate, transportation and land use. Standards of
hazardous waste control shall be premised on technical knowledge, and commonly accepted
practices. Hazardous waste generator licenses may be issued for a term not to exceed five years.
No local government unit shall set standards of hazardous waste control which are in conflict or
inconsistent with those set by the Pollution Control Agency.
    A person who generates less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month is exempt from
the following agency hazardous waste rules:
   (1) rules relating to transportation, manifesting, storage, and labeling for photographic fixer and
X-ray negative wastes that are hazardous solely because of silver content; and
    (2) any rule requiring the generator to send to the agency or commissioner a copy of each
manifest for the transportation of hazardous waste for off-site treatment, storage, or disposal, except
that counties within the metropolitan area may require generators to provide manifests.
Nothing in this paragraph exempts the generator from the agency's rules relating to on-site
accumulation or outdoor storage. A political subdivision or other local unit of government may not
adopt management requirements that are more restrictive than this paragraph.

    (c) Before provisionally discharging, discharging, granting pass-eligible status, approving a pass
plan, or otherwise permanently or temporarily releasing a person committed under this section or
section 253B.185 from a treatment facility, the head of the treatment facility shall make a reasonable
effort to notify any victim of a crime for which the person was convicted that the person may
be discharged or released and that the victim has a right to submit a written statement regarding
decisions of the medical director, special review board, judicial appeal panel, or commissioner with
respect to the person. To the extent possible, the notice must be provided at least 14 days before any
special review board hearing or before a determination on a pass plan.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to victims who have requested notification by contacting, in
writing, the county attorney in the county where the conviction for the crime occurred. A county
attorney who receives a request for notification under this paragraph shall promptly forward the
request to the commissioner of human services.
    (e) The rights under this subdivision are in addition to rights available to a victim under chapter
611A. This provision does not give a victim all the rights of a "notified person" or a person "entitled
to statutory notice" under subdivision 4a, 4b, or 5.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Financial responsibility. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state facility" has the
meaning given in section 246.50. The term also includes state correctional facilities when a proposed
patient remains in a correctional facility beyond the proposed patient's release date as provided in
section 243.053.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 246.54, 253B.045, and any other law to the contrary, when a
petition is filed for commitment under this section pursuant to the notice required in section 244.05,
subdivision 7, the state and county are each responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the person's
confinement at a state facility or county jail, prior to commitment.
    (c) The county shall submit an invoice to the state court administrator for reimbursement of the
state's share of the cost of confinement.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the state's responsibility for reimbursement is limited to the
amount appropriated for this purpose.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Petition for reduction in custody. (a) This subdivision applies only to committed
persons as defined in paragraph (b). The procedures in section 253B.18, subdivision 5a, for victim
notification and right to submit a statement under section 253B.18 apply to petitions filed and
reductions in custody recommended under this subdivision.
   (b) As used in this subdivision:

   (1) "committed person" means an individual committed under this section, or under this section
and under section 253B.18, as mentally ill and dangerous. It does not include persons committed
only as mentally ill and dangerous under section 253B.18; and
    (2) "reduction in custody" means transfer out of a secure treatment facility, a provisional
discharge, or a discharge from commitment.
    (c) A petition for a reduction in custody or an appeal of a revocation of provisional discharge
may be filed by either the committed person or by the head of the treatment facility and must be filed
with and considered by the special review board. A committed person may not petition the special
review board any sooner than six months following either:
    (1) the entry of judgment in the district court of the order for commitment issued under section
253B.18, subdivision 3, or upon the exhaustion of all related appeal rights in state court relating to
that order, whichever is later; or
   (2) any order of the judicial panel or upon the exhaustion of all appeal rights in state court,
whichever is later. The medical director may petition at any time. The special review board
proceedings are not contested cases as defined in chapter 14.
    (d) The special review board shall hold a hearing on each petition before issuing a
recommendation under paragraph (f). Fourteen days before the hearing, the committing court,
the county attorney of the county of commitment, the designated agency, an interested person,
the petitioner and the petitioner's counsel, and the committed person and the committed person's
counsel must be given written notice by the commissioner of the time and place of the hearing
before the special review board. Only those entitled to statutory notice of the hearing or those
administratively required to attend may be present at the hearing. The patient may designate
interested persons to receive notice by providing the names and addresses to the commissioner at
least 21 days before the hearing.
    (e) A person or agency receiving notice that submits documentary evidence to the special
review board before the hearing must also provide copies to the committed person, the committed
person's counsel, the county attorney of the county of commitment, the case manager, and the
commissioner. The special review board must consider any statements received from victims under
section 253B.18, subdivision 5a.
    (f) Within 30 days of the hearing, the special review board shall issue written findings of fact
and shall either deny the petition or recommend approval of the petition to the judicial appeal panel
established under section 253B.19. No reduction in custody or reversal of a revocation of provisional
discharge recommended by the special review board is effective until it has been reviewed by the
judicial appeal panel and until 15 days after an order from the panel affirming or modifying the
recommendation.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 10. Appeal. The committed person or the county attorney of the county from which the
person was committed may petition the judicial appeal panel under section 253B.19 for a rehearing
and reconsideration of a denial of a petition by the special review board under this section. The
petition must be filed, heard, decided, and acted upon, and may be appealed, as set forth in section
253B.19, subdivision 2 to 5.

notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and that the charter school's
board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the sponsor within 14 days of
receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to
make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to
the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the sponsor shall give
reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The sponsor shall

or not renew a contract by the last day of classes in the school year. If the sponsor is a local board,
the school's board of directors may appeal the sponsor's decision to the commissioner.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
   (3) violations of law; or
   (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 308A or 317A, except when the commissioner
approves the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school.
     (c) If at the end of a contract term, either the sponsor or the charter school board of directors wants
to voluntarily terminate the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves
the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school. The commissioner shall
consider whether the charter school and prospective new sponsor have addressed any outstanding
issues raised by the previous sponsor when determining whether to grant the change of sponsor.
The party intending to terminate the contract must notify the other party and the commissioner of
its intent at least 90 days before the date on which the contract ends. The sponsor that is a party to
the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about the fiscal and
student performance of the school. If no different eligible sponsor is approved, the school must be
dissolved according to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
    (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.17, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Referendum revenue. (a) The revenue authorized by section 126C.10, subdivision
1, may be increased in the amount approved by the voters of the district at a referendum called
for the purpose. The referendum may be called by the board or shall be called by the board upon
written petition of qualified voters of the district. The referendum must be conducted one or two
calendar years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one
election to approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted
by mail under paragraph (g), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue per resident
marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board, of increased
revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the number of years
for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall increase annually
by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual inflationary increase
calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing referendum levy
authority is expiring. In this case, the ballot may also compare the proposed levy authority to the
existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount, if any, over the
expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number of years, not to
exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a ballot on the
question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must abbreviate
the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under section
275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies:

    If approved, an amount equal to the approved revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit times
the resident marginal cost pupil units for the school year beginning in the year after the levy is
certified shall be authorized for certification for the number of years approved, if applicable, or until
revoked or reduced by the voters of the district at a subsequent referendum.
    (b) The board must prepare and deliver by first class mail at least 15 days but no more than 30
days before the day of the referendum to each taxpayer a notice of the referendum and the proposed
revenue increase. The board need not mail more than one notice to any taxpayer. For the purpose of
giving mailed notice under this subdivision, owners must be those shown to be owners on the records
of the county auditor or, in any county where tax statements are mailed by the county treasurer,
on the records of the county treasurer. Every property owner whose name does not appear on the
records of the county auditor or the county treasurer is deemed to have waived this mailed notice
unless the owner has requested in writing that the county auditor or county treasurer, as the case
may be, include the name on the records for this purpose. The notice must project the anticipated
amount of tax increase in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads,
apartments, and commercial-industrial property within the school district.
    The notice for a referendum may state that an existing referendum levy is expiring and project
the anticipated amount of increase over the existing referendum levy in the first year, if any,
in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads, apartments, and
commercial-industrial property within the district.

your property taxes."
    (c) A referendum on the question of revoking or reducing the increased revenue amount
authorized pursuant to paragraph (a) may be called by the board and shall be called by the board
upon the written petition of qualified voters of the district. A referendum to revoke or reduce the
revenue amount must state the amount per resident marginal cost pupil unit by which the authority
is to be reduced. Revenue authority approved by the voters of the district pursuant to paragraph
(a) must be available to the school district at least once before it is subject to a referendum on its
revocation or reduction for subsequent years. Only one revocation or reduction referendum may be
held to revoke or reduce referendum revenue for any specific year and for years thereafter.
     (d) A petition authorized by paragraph (a) or (c) is effective if signed by a number of qualified
voters in excess of 15 percent of the registered voters of the district on the day the petition is filed
with the board. A referendum invoked by petition must be held on the date specified in paragraph
(a).
    (e) The approval of 50 percent plus one of those voting on the question is required to pass a
referendum authorized by this subdivision.
    (f) At least 15 days before the day of the referendum, the district must submit a copy of the notice
required under paragraph (b) to the commissioner and to the county auditor of each county in which
the district is located. Within 15 days after the results of the referendum have been certified by the
board, or in the case of a recount, the certification of the results of the recount by the canvassing
board, the district must notify the commissioner of the results of the referendum.

lifelong learning, is to ensure individual academic achievement, an informed citizenry, and a highly
productive work force. This system focuses on the learner, promotes and values diversity, provides
participatory decision making, ensures accountability, models democratic principles, creates and
sustains a climate for change, provides personalized learning environments, encourages learners to
reach their maximum potential, and integrates and coordinates human services for learners. The
public schools of this state shall serve the needs of the students by cooperating with the students'
parents and legal guardians to develop the students' intellectual capabilities and lifework skills in
a safe and positive environment. It is part of the department's mission that within the department's
resources the commissioner shall endeavor to:
   (1) prevent the waste or unnecessary spending of public money;
    (2) use innovative fiscal and human resource practices to manage the state's resources and operate
the department as efficiently as possible;
   (3) coordinate the department's activities wherever appropriate with the activities of other
governmental agencies;
    (4) use technology where appropriate to increase agency productivity, improve customer service,
increase public access to information about government, and increase public participation in the
business of government;
   (5) utilize constructive and cooperative labor-management practices to the extent otherwise
required by chapters 43A and 179A;
   (6) report to the legislature on the performance of agency operations and the accomplishment of
agency goals in the agency's biennial budget according to section 16A.10, subdivision 1; and
   (7) recommend to the legislature appropriate changes in law necessary to carry out the mission
and improve the performance of the department.

early;
   (2) in the area of educator quality, ensure that great teachers and principals are recruited,
prepared, supported, and retained;
   (3) in the area of academic rigor, ensure all roads are rigorous, and all lead to higher education;
    (4) in the area of family and community involvement, ensure families and communities are full
partners in education;
   (5) ensure that all cultures are included and supported, and connections are made across local
and global cultural divides;
    (6) in the area of data and research, ensure that educators use data and research to improve
teaching and learning every day;

    (7) ensure schools are provided with funding that is predictable and sufficient to produce world
class performance;
     (8) ensure schedules and calendars are designed to help all students reach high standards:
    (9) in the area of special education, ensure services for students with disabilities are proactive,

      (2) any state action regarding the rule must evidence consideration of school district autonomy;
and
    (3) the Department of Education, with the assistance of school districts, must make available
information about all state initiatives related to the rule to students and parents, teachers, and the
general public in a timely format that is appropriate, comprehensive, and readily understandable.

require students to satisfactorily complete, as determined by the school district, the course credit
requirements under section 120B.024 and:   ­ successfully pass graduation examinations as required
under section 120B.30.

    Sec. 10. [120B.299] DEFINITIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section apply to this chapter.
   Subd. 2. Growth. "Growth" compares the difference between a student's achievement score at
two distinct points in time.
   Subd. 3. Value-added. "Value-added" is the amount of achievement a student demonstrates
above an established baseline.
    Subd. 4. Growth-based value-added. "Growth-based value-added" is a value-added system of
assessments that measures the difference between an established baseline of growth and a student's
growth over time.
   Subd. 5. Adequate yearly progress. Adequate yearly progress compares the average
achievement of two different groups of students at two different points in time.
    Subd. 6. State growth norm. "State growth norm" is an established statewide percentile, or
standard applicable to all students in a particular grade benchmarked to an established school year.
Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth norm is benchmarked to 2006-2007
school year data until the commissioner next changes the vertically linked scale score. Each time
the commissioner changes the vertically linked scale score, a recognized Minnesota assessment
group composed of assessment and evaluation directors and staff and researchers, under Minnesota
Statutes, section 120B.299, subdivision 6, in collaboration with the Independent Office of
Educational Accountability under section 120B.31, subdivision 3, must recommend a new state
growth norm that the commissioner shall consider with the revised standards. For each newly
established state growth norm, the commissioner also must establish criteria for identifying schools
and school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth in order to advance educators' professional
development and to replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 120B.30, is amended to read:

with subdivision 1a.
   (e) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations, alternate assessments, or exemptions
consistent with applicable federal law, only with parent or guardian approval, for those very few
students for whom the student's individual education plan team under sections 125A.05 and 125A.06
determines that the general statewide test is inappropriate for a student, or for a limited English
proficiency student under section 124D.59, subdivision 2;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
    (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
   Subd. 1a. Statewide and local assessments; results. (a) The commissioner must develop
reading, mathematics, and science assessments aligned with state academic standards that districts
and sites must use to monitor student growth toward achieving those standards. The commissioner
must not develop statewide assessments for academic standards in social studies, health and
physical education, and the arts. The commissioner must require:
    (1) annual reading and mathematics assessments in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school
level for the 2005-2006 school year and later; and
    (2) annual science assessments in one grade in the grades 3 through 5 span, the grades 6 through

     (b) The commissioner must ensure that all statewide tests administered to elementary and
secondary students measure students' academic knowledge and skills and not students' values,
attitudes, and beliefs.

    (1) provide timely, useful, and understandable information on the performance of individual
students, schools, school districts, and the state;

proficiency in the context of the state's grade level academic standards. If a state assessment is not
available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript.
    Subd. 2. Department of Education assistance. The Department of Education shall contract for
professional and technical services according to competitive bidding procedures under chapter 16C
for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. Reporting. The commissioner shall report test data publicly and to stakeholders,
including the performance achievement levels developed from students' unweighted test scores
in each tested subject and a listing of demographic factors that strongly correlate with student
performance. The commissioner shall also report data that compares performance results among
school sites, school districts, Minnesota and other states, and Minnesota and other nations. The
commissioner shall disseminate to schools and school districts a more comprehensive report
containing testing information that meets local needs for evaluating instruction and curriculum.
   Subd. 4. Access to tests. The commissioner must adopt and publish a policy to provide public
and parental access for review of basic skills tests, Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments, or any
other such statewide test and assessment. Upon receiving a written request, the commissioner must

system. The commissioner must apply the state growth norm to students in grades 4 through 8
beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, consistent with section 120B.299, subdivision 6, initially
benchmarking the state growth norm to 2007-2008 school year data. The model must allow the
user to:
      (1) report student growth at and above the state norm; and
    (2) for all student categories with a cell size of at least 20, report and compare aggregated and
disaggregated state growth data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001
No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively. The
model must have the ability to measure the effects on student growth at the teacher team level, grade
teacher teams level, school level, and school district level.

            ­­s If a district has an accountability plan that includes other growth-based value-added
             e­
analysis, the commissioner may, to the extent practicable and consistent with this section,
incorporate those measures in determining whether the district or school site shows growth.
    (d) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2011, must report two core measures indicating the
extent to which current high school graduates are being prepared for postsecondary academic and
career opportunities:
    (1) a preparation measure indicating the number and percentage of high school graduates
in the most recent school year who completed course work important to preparing them for
postsecondary academic and career opportunities, consistent with the core academic subjects
required for admission to Minnesota's public four-year colleges and universities as determined by
the Minnesota Office of Higher Education under chapter 136A; and
   (2) a rigorous coursework measure indicating the number and percentage of high school
graduates in the most recent school year who successfully completed one or more college-level
advanced placement, international baccalaureate, postsecondary enrollment options, other rigorous
courses of study under section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, or industry certification courses.
When reporting the core measures under clauses (1) and (2), the commissioner must also analyze
and report separate categories of information using the nine student categories identified under the
federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female,
respectively.
    (d) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2011, must include summary data showing student's
average self-reported sense of school safety, engagement in school, and the quality of students'
relationship with teachers, administrators, and other students. The commissioner must gather these
data consistently from students in grade 4 or 5, in one grade level in grades 6 through 8, and in
one grade level in high school, as determined by the commissioner in consultation with recognized
and qualified experts.

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­­
                   l­a b­e
                        l­­, valid, replicated evidence showing that when these programs or practices
are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory reading progress. The
program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, instruction in five areas of reading:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and ­e    t­x­­
                                                                            t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
    (b) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
7372                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [90TH DAY

    (c) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships between
written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that stresses
learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and spelling.
   (d) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read orally with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
    (e) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.
    (f) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.18, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Teacher and support personnel qualifications. (a) The Board of Teaching must issue
licenses under its jurisdiction to persons the board finds to be qualified and competent for their
respective positions.
    (b) The board must require a person to successfully complete an examination of skills in
reading, writing, and mathematics before being granted an initial teaching license to provide direct
instruction to pupils in prekindergarten, elementary, secondary, or special education programs. In
addition, the board must require a person to successfully complete a Minnesota reading instruction
competence assessment consistent with subdivision 2c before being granted an initial teaching
license to provide direct instruction to pupils in prekindergarten or elementary programs. The board
must require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program to
provide remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in
their institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination or Minnesota
reading instruction competence assessment, including those for whom English is a second
language. The colleges and universities must provide assistance in the specific academic areas of
deficiency in which the person did not achieve a qualifying score. School districts must provide
similar, appropriate, and timely remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component
and mentoring to those persons employed by the district who completed their teacher education
program outside the state of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach in Minnesota and did
not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English
is a second language. The Board of Teaching shall report annually to the education committees of
the legislature on the total number of teacher candidates during the most recent school year taking
the skills examination, the number who achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the number
who do not achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the distribution of all candidates' scores,
the number of candidates who have taken the examination at least once before, and the number of
candidates who have taken the examination at least once before and achieve a qualifying score.

development efforts. A district may annually waive the requirement to reserve their basic revenue
under this section if a majority vote of the licensed teachers in the district and a majority vote of the

exempt from reserving basic revenue according to this section. Districts may expend an additional
amount of unreserved revenue for staff development based on their needs. With the exception of
amounts reserved for staff development from revenues allocated directly to school sites, the board

percent to be used for district wide staff development efforts. The remaining 25 percent of the
revenue must be used to make grants to school sites for best practices methods. A grant may be

The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online
learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students.
If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation
standard or grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement
is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or
courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03,
subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning student
in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online learning
provider that is not the enrolling district.
      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for payment of any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning

purposes.
    (d) An enrolling district or charter school may offer online learning to its enrolled students.
Such online learning does not generate online learning funds under this section. An enrolling
district or charter school that offers online learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to
the reporting requirements or review criteria under subdivision 7, unless the enrolling district or
charter school is a full-time online provider. A teacher with a Minnesota license must assemble
and deliver instruction to enrolled students receiving online learning from an enrolling district or
charter school. The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts with the computer
or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The instruction may
include curriculum developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota license.

Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students. The delivery of
instruction occurs when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing
assistance and assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons
other than a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants a waiver, a teacher
providing online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in any one online
learning course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply for enrollment to an approved full-time online learning program following
appropriate procedures in subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll
in classes at a local school per contract for instructional services between the online learning provider
and the school district.

The online learning provider must also demonstrate expectations for actual teacher contact time or
other student-to-teacher communication. Once an online learning provider is approved under this
paragraph, all of its online learning course offerings are eligible for payment under this section
unless a course is successfully challenged by an enrolling district or the department under paragraph
(b).
    (b) An enrolling district may challenge the validity of a course offered by an online learning
provider. The department must review such challenges based on the certification procedures under
paragraph (a). The department may initiate its own review of the validity of an online learning course
offered by an online learning provider.
    (c) The department may collect a fee not to exceed $250 for certifying online learning providers

not expire and the expiration date provided in section 15.059, subdivision 5, does not apply to this
section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from June 30, 2007.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) A sponsor may authorize one or more licensed teachers under
section 122A.18, subdivision 1, to operate a charter school subject to approval by the commissioner.
A board must vote on charter school application for sponsorship no later than 90 days after receiving
the application. The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A or
nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply
to the school except as provided in this section. Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a
school district may create a corporation for the purpose of creating a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may form and operate a school, the sponsor must file an affidavit with
the commissioner stating its intent to authorize a charter school. The affidavit must demonstrate the
sponsor's abilities, capacities, and expertise in fulfilling the responsibilities of a sponsor and state the
terms and conditions under which the sponsor would authorize a charter school and how the sponsor
intends to oversee the fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the
terms of the written contract between the sponsor and the charter school board of directors under
subdivision 6 in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The sponsor must submit an
affidavit to the commissioner for each charter school it proposes to authorize. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove the sponsor's proposed authorization within 90 days of receipt of the
affidavit. Failure to obtain commissioner approval precludes a sponsor from authorizing the charter
school that was the subject of the affidavit.
    (c) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as a
cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish
a board of directors composed of at least five nonrelated members until a timely election for members
of the charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws. A
charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members. Any staff members
who are employed at the school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a
cooperative, and all parents of children enrolled in the school m
                                                                ­­ay
                                                                   ­ are eligible to participate in the
election for members of the school's board of directors. Licensed teachers employed at the school,
including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, must be a majority of
the members of the board of directors before the school completes its third year of operation, unless
the commissioner waives the requirement for a majority of licensed teachers on the board. Board of
director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.
   (d) The granting or renewal of a charter by a sponsoring entity must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
   (e) The granting or renewal of a charter school by a sponsor must not be contingent on the

charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the sponsor. A sponsor is
prohibited from entering into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school
that it is authorized to sponsor.

     e­
      ) (f) A sponsor may authorize the operators of a charter school to expand the operation of the
charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those described
in the sponsor's application as approved by the commissioner only after submitting a supplemental
application to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The
supplemental application must provide evidence that:
   (1) the expansion of the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
   (2) the charter school is fiscally sound;
   (3) the sponsor supports the expansion; and
    (4) the building of the additional site meets all health and safety requirements to be eligible for
lease aid.
   ­(­) (g) The commissioner annually must provide timely financial management training to newly
     f­
elected members of a charter school board of directors and ongoing training to other members of a
charter school board of directors. Training must address ways to:
   (1) proactively assess opportunities for a charter school to maximize all available revenue
sources;
   (2) establish and maintain complete, auditable records for the charter school;
   (3) establish proper filing techniques;
    (4) document formal actions of the charter school, including meetings of the charter school board
of directors;
   (5) properly manage and retain charter school and student records;
   (6) comply with state and federal payroll record-keeping requirements; and
    (7) address other similar factors that facilitate establishing and maintaining complete records on
the charter school's operations.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) A member of a charter school board of directors is prohibited
from serving as a member of the board of directors or as an employee or agent of or a contractor
with a for-profit entity with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional
services, goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable at the option
of the commissioner. The charter school's state aid may be reduced by the commissioner under
section 127A.42 if the charter school board fails to correct violations under this subdivision in a
timely manner. A member of a charter school board of directors who violates this prohibition shall
be individually liable to the charter school for any damage caused by the violation.
   (b) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.

    (c) A member of a charter school board of directors that serves as a member of the board of
directors or as an employee or agent of or a contractor with a nonprofit entity with whom the charter
school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional services, goods, or facilities, must disclose all
potential conflicts to the commissioner. A violation of this requirement renders a contract voidable
at the option of the commissioner. The charter school's aid may be reduced by the commissioner
under section 127A.42 if the charter school fails to correct violations under this subdivision in a
timely manner.
    (d) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid
to a teacher employed by the charter school who also serves as a member of the board of directors.
    (e) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to a teacher who
provides services to a charter school through a cooperative formed under chapter 308A when the
teacher also serves on the charter school board of directors.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Contract. The sponsor's authorization for a charter school must be in the form of a
written contract signed by the sponsor and the board of directors of the charter school. The contract
must be completed within 90 days of the commissioner's approval of the sponsor's proposed
authorization. The contract for a charter school must be in writing and contain at least the following:
   (1) a description of a program that carries out one or more of the purposes in subdivision 1;
   (2) specific outcomes pupils are to achieve under subdivision 10;
   (3) admission policies and procedures;
   (4) management and administration of the school;
   (5) requirements and procedures for program and financial audits;
   (6) how the school will comply with subdivisions 8, 13, 16, and 23;
   (7) assumption of liability by the charter school;
   (8) types and amounts of insurance coverage to be obtained by the charter school;
    (9) the term of the contract, which may be up to three years for the initial contract, and up to
five years for renewed contracts based on the academic, financial, and operational performance of
the school;
    (10) ­f
         i­ how the board of directors or the operators of the charter school will provide special
instruction and services for children with a disability under sections 125A.03 to 125A.24, and
125A.65, a description of the financial parameters within which the charter school will operate to
provide the special instruction and services to children with a disability; and
    (11) the process and criteria the sponsor intends to use to monitor and evaluate the fiscal and
student performance of the charter school, consistent with subdivision 15.

wishes to return, or February 1 of the calendar year in which the leave is scheduled to terminate.
Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and except for section 122A.46, subdivision 7,

intention to return, seniority, salary, and insurance.

Retirement Association account by paying both the employer and employee contributions
based upon the annual salary of the teacher for the last full pay period before the leave began.
The retirement association may impose reasonable requirements to efficiently administer this

of the contract with a sponsor must be for the term contained in the contract according to subdivision
6. The sponsor may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground listed in
paragraph (b). A sponsor may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the contract for
any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating a contract,
the sponsor shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed action in writing
by registered mail. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail
and that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before
the sponsor within 14 days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure
by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall
be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a
hearing, the sponsor shall give reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the
hearing date. The sponsor shall conduct an informal hearing before taking final action. The sponsor

    Subdivision 1. Duties of fire marshal. Consistent with sections 121A.035, 121A.037, and this
section, it shall be the duty of the state fire marshal, deputies and assistants, to require public and
private schools and educational institutions to have at least five fire drills each school year, to expect
students to be present and participate in these drills, and to keep all doors and exits unlocked from
the inside of the building during school hours.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2008-2009 school year and later.
     Sec. 51. Laws 2007, chapter 146, article 2, section 46, subdivision 13, is amended to read:

and 124D.091:
7392                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [90TH DAY

       $           6,500,000       .....   2008
       $           6,500,000       .....   2009

   Of this amount, $2,500,000 each year is for concurrent enrollment program aid under
Minnesota Statutes, section 124D.091. If the appropriation is insufficient, the commissioner must
proportionately reduce the aid payment to each district. Any balance in the first year does not
cancel but is available in the second year.
   The base appropriation for fiscal year 2010 and later is $2,000,000.
   Sec. 52. IMPLEMENTING A STUDENT GROWTH-BASED VALUE-ADDED SYSTEM.
    (a) To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), and to help parents and members of the public compare the reported data, the
commissioner must convene a group of expert school district assessment and evaluation staff,
including a recognized Minnesota assessment group composed of assessment and evaluation
directors and staff and researchers under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.299, subdivision 6, and
interested stakeholders, including school superintendents, school principals, and school teachers to
examine the actual statewide performance of students using Minnesota's growth-based value-added
system and establish criteria for identifying schools and school districts that demonstrate
accelerated growth in order to advance educators' professional development and replicate programs
that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs.
    (b) The commissioner must submit a written report to the education committees of the house of
representatives and senate by February 15, 2009, describing the criteria for identifying schools and
school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards in the 2008-2009 school year and later.
  Sec. 53. IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS COURSEWORK MEASURES RELATED TO
STUDENT PERFORMANCE.
    To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (2), and to help parents and members of the public compare
the reported data, the commissioner of education must convene a group of recognized and
qualified experts and interested stakeholders including parents to develop a model projecting
anticipated performance of each high school on preparation and rigorous coursework measures
that compares the school with similar schools. The model must use information about entering
high school students based on particular background characteristics that are predictive of differing
rates of college readiness. The characteristics include grade 8 achievement levels, high school
student mobility, high school student attendance, the nine student categories identified under the
federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, and two student gender categories of male and female,
respectively, to predict student performance on these two core measures. The commissioner must
use the anticipated level of entering students' performance to provide a context for interpreting
graduating students' actual performance.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2011.

  Sec. 54. IMPLEMENTING MEASURES FOR ASSESSING STUDENTS'
SELF-REPORTED SENSE OF SCHOOL SAFETY, ENGAGEMENT IN SCHOOL, AND
THE QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHERS, ADMINISTRATORS, AND
OTHER STUDENTS.
   (a) To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (d), and to help parents and members of the public compare the reported data, the
commissioner of education, in consultation with interested stakeholders, must convene a group of
recognized and qualified experts including parents to:
   (1) analyze the University of Minnesota student safety and engagement survey instrument and
other commonly recognized survey instruments to select or devise the survey instrument that best
meets state accountability requirements;
    (2) ensure that the identified survey instrument has sound psychometric properties and is useful
for intervention planning;
    (3) determine at what grade levels to administer the survey instrument and ensure that the survey
instrument can be used at those grade levels; and
    (4) determine through disaggregated use of survey indicators or other means how to report
"safety" in order to comply with federal law.
    (b) The commissioner must submit a written report to the education committees of the house of
representatives and senate by February 15, 2009, presenting the experts' responses to paragraph (a),
clauses (1) to (4).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2011.
   Sec. 55. GROWTH-BASED VALUE-ADDED SYSTEM.
    The growth-based value-added system used by the commissioner of education to comply with
Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), must be consistent with the
growth-based value-added model contained in the document labeled "Educational Report Card
Growth Model, 2008." The document must be deposited with the Minnesota Office of the Revisor
of Statutes, the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, and the Minnesota State Law Library,
where the document shall be maintained until the commissioner implements the growth-based
value-added system under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). The
recognized Minnesota assessment group composed of assessment and evaluation directors and
staff and researchers under Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.299, subdivision 6, must determine
whether the growth-based value-added model the commissioner uses to comply with Minnesota

placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
    (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
    (b) If the placement of a pupil for care and treatment is not made by the district of residence, the
district of residence must be notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement

decision. When an immediate emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident
district participation in the placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed,
if different from the district of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency
placement within 15 days of the placement. When placement has been made without prior
consultation with the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days following
notice of the emergency placement to respond and must, at that time, be provided an opportunity
to participate in the placement decision.
    ­
    (b
     ­­) (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in
another district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care
and treatment ­f­
                a­i­i
                 c­l­t
                     ­y­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident
district may establish reasonable restrictions on transportation; however, if a court or state agency
has ordered the placement at the day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a
copy of the order, the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless
the court or agency otherwise orders. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district
during regular operating hours of ­h
                                   t­­e that district. The resident district may provide the educational
program at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which
the day treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­

However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be the
district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational program
in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­
                                                                                 c­

    (­
     e­
      ) (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When placement has been made without prior consultation with the resident district, the
resident district has up to five business days following notice of the emergency placement to respond
and must, at that time, be provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­
                                  a­ i­i
                                    c­l­t
                                        ­y­ program for the pupil. The resident district may establish
reasonable restrictions on transportation; however, if a Minnesota court or state agency has ordered
the placement at the day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the
order, the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency otherwise orders. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of ­h t­­
                                e that district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract

with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 125A.744, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Implementation. Consistent with section 256B.0625, subdivision 26, school districts
may enroll as medical assistance providers or subcontractors and bill the Department of Human
Services under the medical assistance fee for service claims processing system for special education
services which are covered services under chapter 256B, which are provided in the school setting
for a medical assistance recipient, and for whom the district has secured informed consent consistent
with section 13.05, subdivision 4, paragraph (d), and section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),
to bill for each type of covered service. School districts shall be reimbursed by the commissioner of
human services for the federal share of individual education plan health-related services that qualify
for reimbursement by medical assistance, minus up to five percent retained by the commissioner of
human services for administrative costs,  ­­n

may withhold up to five percent of each payment to a school district. Following the end of each fiscal
year, the commissioner shall settle up with each school district in order to ensure that collections
from each district for departmental administrative costs are made on a pro rata basis according
to federal earnings for these services in each district. A school district is not eligible to enroll as
a home care provider or a personal care provider organization for purposes of billing home care
services under sections 256B.0651 and 256B.0653 to 256B.0656 until the commissioner of human
services issues a bulletin instructing county public health nurses on how to assess for the needs
of eligible recipients during school hours. To use private duty nursing services or personal care
services at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care
plan identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school.

The definition may not allow "major renovations" to encompass less than 10,000 square feet or to
encompass less than the complete replacement of the mechanical, ventilation, or cooling system
of the building or a section of the building. The design guidelines must establish sustainability
guidelines that include air quality and lighting standards and that create and maintain a healthy
environment and facilitate productivity improvements; specify ways to reduce material costs; and
must consider the long-term operating costs of the building, including the use of renewable energy
sources and distributed electric energy generation that uses a renewable source or natural gas or a
fuel that is as clean or cleaner than natural gas.
   Subd. 3. Development of guidelines; applicability. (a) In developing the guidelines, the
departments shall use an open process, including providing the opportunity for public comment.
The guidelines established under this section are mandatory for all new buildings receiving funding
from the bond proceeds fund after January 1, 2004, and for all major renovations receiving funding
from the bond proceeds fund after January 1, 2009.
   (b) The commissioners of administration and commerce shall review the guidelines periodically

    Subdivision 1. Bonding authority. (a) The commissioner of finance, if requested by the
commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency, shall sell and issue state revenue bonds for the
following purposes:
   (1) to take actions related to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants at and from
qualified landfill facilities as provided in section 115B.42, subdivision 2;
   (2) to pay the costs of issuance, debt service, and bond insurance or other credit enhancements
and to fund reserves; and

    Subd. 2. Procedure. The commissioner of finance may sell and issue the bonds on the terms
and conditions the commissioner of finance determines to be in the best interests of the state. The
bonds may be sold at public or private sale. The commissioner of finance may enter any agreements
or pledges the commissioner of finance determines necessary or useful to sell the bonds that are

and any interest accrued or to accrue to the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding
bonds. The proceeds of the refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the commissioner of finance,
be applied to the purchases or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or the redemption
of the outstanding bonds on the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and
may, until so used, be placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption.
Refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be issued and secured in the manner provided
by the commissioner of finance.
   Subd. 5. Not a general or moral obligation. Bonds issued under this section are not public
debt, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of the state are not pledged for their payment. The
bonds may not be paid, directly in whole or in part from a tax of statewide application on any class of
property, income, transaction, or privilege. Payment of the bonds is limited to the revenues explicitly
authorized to be pledged under this section. The state neither makes nor has a moral obligation to
pay the bonds if the pledged revenues and other legal security for them is insufficient.

bondholders. The trustee has the powers and authority vested in it by the commissioner of finance
under the bond and trust indentures.
    Subd. 7. Pledges. Any pledge made by the commissioner of finance is valid and binding from the
time the pledge is made. The money or property pledged and later received by the commissioner of
finance is immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the property
or money or further act, and the lien of any pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having
claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the commissioner of finance, whether or
not those parties have notice of the lien or pledge. Neither the order nor any other instrument by
which a pledge is created need be recorded.
    Subd. 8. Bonds; purchase and cancellation. The commissioner of finance, subject to
agreements with bondholders that may then exist, may, out of any money available for the purpose,
purchase bonds of the commissioner of finance at a price not exceeding (1) if the bonds are then
redeemable, the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment
date thereon, or (2) if the bonds are not redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first
date after the purchase upon which the bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest
to that date.
    Subd. 9. State pledge against impairment of contracts. The state pledges and agrees with the
holders of any bonds that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the commissioner of
finance to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the bondholders, or in any way impair
the rights and remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with interest on them, with interest
on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or
proceeding by or on behalf of the bondholders, are fully met and discharged. The commissioner of
finance may include this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders of
bonds issued under this section.

   (i) the work is appropriate for Youthbuild, as mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the local
Youthbuild program, considering safety and skills needed;
    (ii) it is demonstrated by Youthbuild that using Youthbuild will not increase the overall cost of
the project; and

  Sec. 43. [137.63] BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH FACILITIES FUNDING
PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Program established. A biomedical science research facilities funding program
is established to provide appropriations to the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota for
up to 80 percent of the project costs for each of four projects approved by the Board of Regents
under section 137.64.
    Subd. 2. Project requirements. The Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota, either
acting on its own or in collaboration with another private or public entity, must pay at least 20 percent
of the project costs for each of four projects.
   Sec. 44. [137.64] CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENTS TO UNIVERSITY.
    Subdivision 1. Certifications. Before the commissioner may make any payments authorized
in this section to the Board of Regents for a biomedical science research facility project, the
commissioner must certify that the board has, by board resolution, approved the maximum project
cost for the project and complied with the requirements of section 137.63, subdivision 2. For each
project approved by the board, the board must certify to the commissioner the amount of the annual
payments of principal and interest required to service each series of bonds issued by the University
of Minnesota for the project, and the actual amount of the state's annual payment to the University
of Minnesota under subdivision 2. The annual payment must not exceed the amount required to
pay debt service on the bonds issued to finance 80 percent of the project costs.
    Subd. 2. Payments. On July 15 of each year after the certification under subdivision 1, but
no earlier than July 15, 2009, and for so long thereafter as any bonds issued by the board for the
construction of a project are outstanding, the state must transfer to the board annual payments as
certified under subdivision 1, up to the maximum amounts in the appropriation schedule under
subdivision 3. Payments under this section are to reimburse the Board of Regents for the state's
share of the project costs for the biomedical science research facility projects, provided that the
principal amount of bonds issued by the University of Minnesota to pay the state's share of the costs
must not exceed $233,600,000.
   Subd. 3. Appropriations. Annual appropriations are made from the general fund to the
commissioner of finance for transfer to the Board of Regents, as follows:
   (1) up to $1,000,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2010;

following the certification of the last project by the commissioner.
    Subd. 4. Reinvestment. The Board of Regents must, to the extent permitted under federal law
and University of Minnesota policies, place a priority on reducing the state's share of project costs by
dedicating a share of the proceeds from any commercialization or licensing revenues attributable to
research conducted in the biomedical science facilities to reducing the appropriations needed under
subdivision 3.

      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 341.26, is amended to read:
      341.26 MEETINGS.
    The commission shall hold a regular meeting quarterly and may hold special meetings. Except as
otherwise provided in law, all meetings of the commission must be open to the public and reasonable
notice of the meetings must be given under chapter 13D. If compliance with section 13D.02 is
impractical, the commission may conduct a meeting of its members by telephone or other electronic
means so long as the following conditions are met:
   (1) all members of the commission participating in the meeting, wherever their physical location,
can hear one another and can hear all discussion and testimony;
    (2) members of the public present at the regular meeting location of the commission can hear
clearly all discussion and testimony and all votes of members of the commission and, if needed,
receive those services required by sections 15.44 and 15.441;
      (3) at least one member of the commission is physically present at the regular meeting location;
and
   (4) all votes are conducted by roll call, so each member's vote on each issue can be identified
and recorded.
    Each member of the commission participating in a meeting by telephone or other electronic
means is considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum and participating
in all proceedings.
    If a telephone or other electronic means is used to conduct a regular, special, or emergency
meeting, the commission, to the extent practical, shall allow a person to monitor the meeting
electronically from a remote location. The commission may require the person making such a
connection to pay for documented costs that the commission incurs as a result of the additional
connection.
    If a telephone or other electronic means is used to conduct a regular, special, or emergency
meeting, the commission shall provide notice of the regular meeting location, of the fact that some
members may participate by telephone or other electronic means, and that a person may monitor
the meeting electronically from a remote location. The timing and method of providing notice is
governed by section 13D.04.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

    (7) immediately suspend an individual license for a medical condition, including but not
limited to a medical condition resulting from an injury sustained during a match, bout, or contest
