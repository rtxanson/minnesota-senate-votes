      Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.9512, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Applicants. (a) Interested eligible organizations may apply to the commissioner for
grants under this section. Two or more eligible organizations may jointly apply for a grant. Priority
shall be given to community action agencies in greater Minnesota and to either community action
agencies or neighborhood based nonprofit organizations in cities of the first class. Of the total
annual appropriation, 12.5 percent may be used for administrative purposes. The commissioner may
deviate from this percentage if a grantee can justify the need for a larger administrative allowance.
Of this amount, up to five percent may be used by the commissioner for state administrative

purposes. Applications must provide information requested by the commissioner, including at least
the information required to assess the factors listed in paragraph (d).
    (b) The commissioner must consult with boards of health to provide swab team services
for purposes of secondary prevention. The priority for swab teams created by grants to eligible
organizations under this section must be work assigned by the commissioner of health, or by a
board of health if so designated by the commissioner of health, to provide secondary prevention
swab team services to fulfill the requirements of section 144.9504, subdivision 6, in response to a
lead order. Swab teams assigned work under this section by the commissioner, that are not engaged
daily in fulfilling the requirements of section 144.9504, subdivision 6, must deliver swab team
services in response to elevated blood lead levels as defined in section 144.9501, subdivision 9,
where lead orders were not issued, and for purposes of primary prevention in census tracts known
to be in areas at high risk for toxic lead exposure as described in section 144.9503, subdivision 2.
   (c) Any additional money must be used for grants to establish swab teams for primary prevention
under section 144.9503, in census tracts in areas at high risk for toxic lead exposure as determined
under section 144.9503, subdivision 2.
     (d) In evaluating grant applications, the commissioner must consider the following criteria:
     (1) the use of lead contractors and lead workers for residential swab team services;
   (2) the participation of neighborhood groups and individuals, as swab team workers, in areas at
high risk for toxic lead exposure;
   (3) plans for the provision of swab team services for primary and secondary prevention as
required under subdivision 4;
   (4) plans for supervision, training, career development, and postprogram placement of swab
team members; and

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 49. Lead risk assessments. (a) Effective October 1, 2007, or six months after federal
approval, whichever is later, medical assistance covers lead risk assessments provided by a lead
risk assessor who is licensed by the commissioner of health under section 144.9505 and employed
by an assessing agency as defined in section 144.9501. Medical assistance covers a onetime on-site
investigation of a recipient's home or primary residence to determine the existence of lead so long as
the recipient is under the age of 21 and has a venous blood lead level specified in section 144.9504,
subdivision 2, paragraph (a).
    (b) Medical assistance reimbursement covers the lead risk assessor's time to complete the
following activities:
   (1) gathering samples;
   (2) interviewing family members;
   (3) gathering data, including meter readings; and
   (4) providing a report with the results of the investigation and options for reducing lead-based
paint hazards.
    Medical assistance coverage of lead risk assessment does not include testing of environmental
substances such as water, paint, or soil or any other laboratory services. Medical assistance coverage
of lead risk assessments is not included in the capitated services for children enrolled in health plans
through the prepaid medical assistance program and the MinnesotaCare program.
    (c) Payment for lead risk assessment must be cost-based and must meet the criteria for
federal financial participation under the Medicaid program. The rate must be based on allowable
expenditures from cost information gathered. Under section 144.9507, subdivision 5, federal
medical assistance funds may not replace existing funding for lead-related activities. The
nonfederal share of costs for services provided under this subdivision must be from state or
local funds and is the responsibility of the agency providing the risk assessment. When the risk
assessment is conducted by the commissioner of health, the state share must be from appropriations
to the commissioner of health for lead programs under sections 144.9502 and 144.9508. Eligible
expenditures for the nonfederal share of costs may not be made from federal funds or funds used to
match other federal funds. Any federal disallowances are the responsibility of the agency providing
risk assessment services.
   Sec. 7. STUDY OF BLOOD LEAD TESTING METHODS.
    (a) The commissioner of health, in consultation with the commissioner of human services, cities
of the first class, health care providers, and other interested parties, shall conduct a study to evaluate
blood lead testing methods used to confirm elevated blood lead status. The study shall examine:
   (1) the false positive rate of capillary tests for children who are younger than 72 months old;
   (2) current protocols for conducting capillary testing, including filter paper methodology; and
    (3) existing guidelines and regulations from other states and federal agencies regarding lead
testing.

   (b) The commissioner shall make recommendations on:
    (1) the use of capillary tests to initiate environmental investigations and case management,
including number and timing of tests and fiscal implications for state and local lead programs; and
   (2) reducing the state mandatory intervention to ten micrograms of lead per deciliter of whole
blood.
   (c) The commissioner shall submit the results of the study and recommendations, including any
necessary legislative changes, to the legislature by January 15, 2008.
   Sec. 8. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.9512, subdivisions 4, 6, 7, and 8, are repealed."

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 287.21, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Determination of tax. (a) A tax is imposed on each deed or instrument by
which any real property in this state is granted, assigned, transferred, or otherwise conveyed. The
tax applies against the net consideration. For purposes of the tax, the conversion of a corporation
to a limited liability company, a limited liability company to a corporation, a partnership to a
limited partnership, a limited partnership to another limited partnership or other entity, or a similar
conversion of one entity to another does not grant, assign, transfer, or convey real property.
    (b) The tax is determined in the following manner: (1) when transfers are made by instruments
pursuant to (i) consolidations or mergers, or (ii) designated transfers, the tax is $1.65; (2) when there
is no consideration or when the consideration, exclusive of the value of any lien or encumbrance

             ­ .005 of the net consideration.
     (c) If, within six months from the date of a designated transfer, an ownership interest in the
grantee entity is transferred by an initial owner to any person or entity with the result that the
designated transfer would not have been a designated transfer if made to the grantee entity with
its subsequent ownership, then a tax is imposed at .0033 of the net consideration for the designated
transfer. If the subsequent transfer of ownership interests was reasonably expected at the time of
the designated transfer, the applicable penalty under section 287.31, subdivision 1, must be paid.
The deed tax imposed under this paragraph is due within 30 days of the subsequent transfer that
caused the tax to be imposed under this paragraph. Involuntary transfers of ownership shall not be
considered transfers of ownership under this paragraph. The commissioner may adopt rules defining
the types of transfers to be considered involuntary.
    (d) The tax is due at the time a taxable deed or instrument is presented for recording, except
as provided in paragraph (c). The commissioner may require the tax to be documented in a manner
prescribed by the commissioner, and may require that the documentation be attached to and recorded
as part of the deed or instrument. The county recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the attachment
for recording as part of the deed or instrument and may not require, as a condition of recording a
deed or instrument, evidence that a transfer is a designated transfer in addition to that required by
the commissioner. Such an attachment shall not, however, provide actual or constructive notice of
the information contained therein for purposes of determining any interest in the real property. The
commissioner shall prescribe the manner in which the tax due under paragraph (c) is to be paid and
may require grantees of designated transfers to file with the commissioner subsequent statements
verifying that the tax provided under paragraph (c) does not apply.

the general fund to the commissioner of finance for transfer to the housing development fund and
credit to the housing trust fund account to be used for rental assistance. No more than ten percent
of this appropriation may be used to operate rental housing under this section. This appropriation
to the housing trust fund account must not be used to supplant appropriation levels for housing in
effect on June 30, 2007.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 462A.33, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
