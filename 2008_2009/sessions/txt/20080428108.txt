The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
8910                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 599, a legislative resolution urging Congress and the
President to end trade, financial, and travel restrictions to Cuba.
I am aware of the desire of Minnesota's agriculture community to increase trade with Cuba.
However, this non-binding resolution is not appropriate and would not further that goal.
Minnesota farmers produce some of the best agricultural products in the world. Current federal
policy allows for the sale of food, agricultural products, and medicine with Cuba. As Governor, I
have sought to expand the global reach of our state's goods and services. However, it is important
that we do so in a manner that is consistent with our country's foreign policy.
Current federal law and U.S. State Department policy already provide Minnesota producers with
opportunities to expand the sale of agricultural and other marketable goods to Cuban citizens.
Without fundamental change in the Cuban government, removing current trade restrictions would
not necessarily increase sales of Minnesota agricultural products in Cuba. In 2007, the U.S.
government authorized more than $3.6 billion in agricultural product sales to Cuba. However,
Cuba elected to purchase less than 1/7 of that amount. Accordingly, there is room for an expansion
of sales to Cuba under current policy.
Moreover, our federal government should address foreign policy matters, not state legislatures.
Forwarding this resolution to the federal government would have Minnesota promoting a position
that is contradictory to the long-standing policy of the United States. That policy has been adhered
to and supported by both parties for decades.
The Cuban government is totalitarian. Most of Cuba's economy is state-owned, private property
rights are essentially disregarded, and Cuba's human rights record is poor. Significant progress needs
to be made before the United States should consider establishing full diplomatic and commercial
relations with Cuba. Providing more economic opportunity for Cuba through trade will enable and
empower the current regime.
The Organization of American States (OAS) brings together all 35 nations from the Western
Hemisphere, including the United States, to strengthen cooperation on democratic values, promote
human rights, and address shared problems. Although Cuba is listed as a member, the OAS has
excluded the government of Cuba from participation in the OAS.
In 2001, governments of the OAS member nations adopted the "Inter-American Democratic
Charter" which provides: "cooperation between American states require the political organization
of those states based on the effective exercise of representative democracy." This charter outlined
numerous additional economic development objectives for trade between nations, all of which
were fundamentally underpinned by governmental acceptance of representative democracy. Cuba
has yet to meet this standard in any meaningful way.
Ultimately, expanded trade with Cuba will occur only when there is fundamental change in Cuba's
government.
It is unfortunate that the Legislature passed a bill that completely contradicts a long history of U.S.
policy against a totalitarian nation. We are hopeful that someday the Cuban government will make
the changes necessary to join other democracies and avail itself of the opportunity to import even

employee's work location, work mailbox, in an employee break room or meal area, or on the
employee's work computer. Reasonable rules concerning the quantity of the communications,
political or other inappropriate content of the communications, attachments to electronic
communications, and appropriate nonwork times for review of these types of communications are
permitted. An employer may discipline or discharge an employee for violations of these rules in
accordance with the employer's personnel policies or union contract.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.047, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. General rule. Unemployment benefits paid to an applicant, including extended,       ­
ad
­­d  i­i
   ­­t  ­n
       ­o ­­l­and shared work benefits, will be used in computing the future tax rate of a taxpaying base
           a­,
period employer or charged to the reimbursable account of a base period nonprofit or government
employer that has elected to be liable for reimbursements except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3.
The amount of unemployment benefits used in computing the future tax rate of taxpaying employers
or charged to the reimbursable account of a nonprofit or government employer that has elected to
be liable for reimbursements is the same percentage of the total amount of unemployment benefits
paid as the percentage of wage credits from the employer is of the total amount of wage credits from
all the applicant's base period employers.
  In making computations under this subdivision, the amount of wage credits, if not a whole dollar,
must be computed to the nearest whole dollar.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.047, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Exceptions for all employers. Unemployment benefits paid will not be used in
computing the future tax rate of a taxpaying base period employer or charged to the reimbursable
account of a base period nonprofit or government employer that has elected to be liable for
reimbursements when:
   (1) the applicant was discharged from the employment because of aggravated employment
misconduct as determined under section 268.095. This exception applies only to unemployment
benefits paid for periods after the applicant's discharge from employment;
    (2) an applicant's discharge from that employment occurred because a law required removal of
the applicant from the position the applicant held;
   (3) the employer is in the tourist or recreation industry and is in active operation of business less
than 15 calendar weeks each year and the applicant's wage credits from the employer are less than
600 times the applicable state or federal minimum wage;
    (4) the employer provided regularly scheduled part-time employment to the applicant during the
applicant's base period and continues to provide the applicant with regularly scheduled part-time
employment during the benefit year of at least 90 percent of the part-time employment provided in
the base period, and is an involved employer because of the applicant's loss of other employment.
This exception terminates effective the first week that the employer fails to meet the benefit year
employment requirements. This exception applies to educational institutions without consideration
of the period between academic years or terms;
    (5) the employer is a fire department or firefighting corporation or operator of a life-support
transportation service, and continues to provide employment for the applicant as a volunteer
firefighter or a volunteer ambulance service personnel during the benefit year on the same basis that
employment was provided in the base period. This exception terminates effective the first week
that the employer fails to meet the benefit year employment requirements;

    (6) the applicant's unemployment from this employer was a direct result of the condemnation
of property by a governmental agency, a fire, flood, or act of nature, where 25 percent or more of
the employees employed at the affected location, including the applicant, became unemployed as a
result. This exception does not apply where the unemployment was a direct result of the intentional
act of the employer or a person acting on behalf of the employer;
   (7) the unemployment benefits were paid by another state as a result of the transferring of wage
credits under a combined wage arrangement provided for in section 268.131;
  (8) the applicant stopped working because of a labor dispute at the applicant's primary place of
employment if the employer was not a party to the labor dispute;
   (9) the unemployment benefits were determined overpaid unemployment benefits under section
268.18; ­
        o­r
    (10) the applicant was employed as a replacement worker, for a period of six months or longer,
for an employee who is in the military reserve and was called for active duty during the time the
applicant worked as a replacement, and the applicant was laid off because the employee returned to
employment after active duty; or
   (11) the trust fund was reimbursed for the unemployment benefits by the federal government.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Payments that delay unemployment benefits. (a) An applicant is not eligible to
receive unemployment benefits for any week with respect to which the applicant is receiving, has
received, or has filed for payment, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, in the form of:
   (1) vacation pay paid upon temporary, indefinite, or seasonal separation. This clause does not
apply to (i) vacation pay paid upon a permanent separation from employment, or (ii) vacation pay
paid from a vacation fund administered by a union or a third party not under the control of the
employer;
   (2) severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, and any other payments, except earnings under
subdivision 5, and back pay under subdivision 6, paid by an employer because of, upon, or after
separation from employment, but only if the payment is considered wages at the time of payment
under section 268.035, subdivision 29; or
     (3) pension, retirement, or annuity payments from any plan contributed to by a base period
employer including the United States government, except Social Security benefits that are provided
for in subdivision 4. The base period employer is considered to have contributed to the plan if the
contribution is excluded from the definition of wages under section 268.035, subdivision 29, clause
(1).
   An applicant is not considered to have received the lump sum payment if the applicant
immediately deposits that payment in a qualified pension plan or account.
    (b) This subdivision applies to all the weeks of payment. Payments under paragraph (a), clauses
(1) and (2), are applied to the period immediately following the last day of employment ­an­d­. The

    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received is divided by
the applicant's last level of regular weekly pay from the employer; or
   (2) if the payment is made in a lump sum, that sum is divided by the applicant's last level of
regular weekly pay from the employer.
   (c) If the payment is less than the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount,
unemployment benefits are reduced by the amount of the payment. If the computation of reduced
unemployment benefits is not a whole dollar, it is rounded down to the next lower whole dollar.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 16, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 16. Actively seeking suitable employment defined. (a) "Actively seeking suitable
employment" means those reasonable, diligent efforts an individual in similar circumstances would
make if genuinely interested in obtaining suitable employment under the existing conditions in the
labor market area. Limiting the search to positions that are not available or are above the applicant's
training, experience, and qualifications is not "actively seeking suitable employment."
    (b) To be considered "actively seeking suitable employment" an applicant must, when
reasonable, contact those employers from whom the applicant was laid off because of lack of work
and request suitable employment.
   (c) If reasonable prospects of suitable employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation do not exist, the applicant must actively seek other suitable employment to be
considered "actively seeking suitable employment." This applies to an applicant who is seasonally
unemployed.
     (d) An applicant who is seeking employment only through a union is ­             no­­t considered actively

state average unemployment rate for the prior 12-month period and the state average unemployment
rate for the same 12-month period was at least 4.6 percent. The commissioner must calculate the

    Sec. 3. [246B.06] ESTABLISHMENT OF MINNESOTA STATE INDUSTRIES.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; purpose. (a) The commissioner of human services may
establish, equip, maintain, and operate the Minnesota State Industries at any Minnesota sex
offender program facility under this chapter. The commissioner may establish industrial and
commercial activities for sex offender treatment patients as the commissioner deems necessary and
suitable to the profitable employment, educational training, and development of proper work habits
of patients consistent with the requirements in section 246B.05. The industrial and commercial
activities authorized by this section are designated Minnesota State Industries and must be for the
primary purpose of sustaining and ensuring Minnesota State Industries' self-sufficiency, providing
educational training, meaningful employment, and the teaching of proper work habits to the
patients of the Minnesota sex offender program under this chapter, and not solely as competitive
business ventures.
    (b) The net profits from Minnesota State Industries must be used for the benefit of the
patients as it relates to building education and self-sufficiency skills. Prior to the establishment
of any industrial and commercial activity, the commissioner of human services may consult with
8950                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

stakeholders including representatives of business, industry, organized labor, the commissioner
of education, the state Apprenticeship Council, the commissioner of labor and industry, the
commissioner of employment and economic development, the commissioner of administration, and
other stakeholders the commissioner deems qualified. The purpose of the stakeholder consultation
is to determine the quantity and nature of the goods, wares, merchandise, and services to be made
or provided, and the types of processes to be used in their manufacture, processing, repair, and
production consistent with the greatest opportunity for the reform and educational training of the
patients, and with the best interests of the state, business, industry, and labor.
    (c) The commissioner of human services shall, at all times in the conduct of any industrial or
commercial activity authorized by this section, utilize patient labor to the greatest extent feasible,
provided that the commissioner may employ all administrative, supervisory, and other skilled
workers necessary to the proper instruction of the patients and the profitable and efficient operation
of the industrial and commercial activities authorized by this section.
    (d) The commissioner of human services may authorize the director of any Minnesota sex
offender treatment facility under the commissioner's control to accept work projects from outside
sources for processing, fabrication, or repair, provided that preference is given to the performance
of work projects for state departments and agencies.
    Subd. 2. Revolving fund. As described in section 246B.05, subdivision 2, there is established
a Minnesota State Industries revolving fund under the control of the commissioner of human
services. The revolving fund must be used for Minnesota State Industries authorized under this
section, including, but not limited to, the purchase of equipment and raw materials, the payment
of salaries and wages, and other necessary expenses as determined by the commissioner of
human services. The purchase of services, materials, and commodities used in and held for resale
are not subject to the competitive bidding procedures of section 16C.06, but are subject to all
other provisions of chapters 16B and 16C. When practical, purchases must be made from small
targeted group businesses designated under section 16C.16. Additionally, the expenses of patient
educational training and self-sufficiency skills may be financed from the revolving fund in an
amount to be determined by the commissioner or designee. The proceeds and income from all
Minnesota State Industries conducted at the Minnesota sex offender treatment facilities must be
deposited in the revolving fund subject to disbursement under subdivision 3. The commissioner
of human services may request that money in the fund be invested pursuant to section 11A.25.
Proceeds from the investment not currently needed must be accounted for separately and credited
to the revolving fund.
    Subd. 3. Disbursement from fund. The Minnesota State Industries revolving fund must be
deposited in the state treasury and paid out only on proper vouchers as authorized and approved by
the commissioner of human services, and in the same manner and under the same restrictions as are
now provided by law for the disbursement of funds by the commissioner. An amount deposited in
the state treasury equal to six months of net operating cash as determined by the prior 12 months
of revenue and cash flow statements must be restricted for use only by Minnesota State Industries
as described under subdivision 2. For purposes of this subdivision, "net operating cash" means net
income, minus sales, plus cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold include all direct costs of industry
products attributable to the goods' production.
   Subd. 4. Revolving fund; borrowing. The commissioner of human services is authorized
to borrow sums of money as the commissioner deems necessary to meet current demands on
108TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008                                         8951

the Minnesota State Industries revolving fund. The sums borrowed must not exceed, in any
calendar year, six months of net operating cash as determined by the previous 12 months of the
industries' revenue and cash flow statements. If the commissioner of human services determines
that borrowing of funds is necessary, the commissioner of human services shall certify this need
to the commissioner of finance. Funds may be borrowed from general fund appropriations to the
Minnesota sex offender program with the authorization of the commissioner of finance. Upon
authorization of the commissioner of finance, the transfer must be made and credited to the
Minnesota State Industries revolving fund. The sum transferred to the Minnesota State Industries
revolving fund must be repaid by the commissioner of human services from the revolving fund
to the fund from which it was transferred in a time period specified by the commissioner of
finance, but by no later than the end of the biennium, as defined in section 16A.011, in which the
loan is made. When any transfer is made to the Minnesota State Industries revolving fund, the
commissioner of finance shall notify the commissioner of human services of the amount transferred
to the fund and the date the transfer is to be repaid.
    Subd. 5. Federal grant fund transfers. Grants received by the commissioner of human
services from the federal government for any vocational training program or for administration by
the commissioner of human services must (1) be credited to a federal grant fund and then (2) be
transferred from the federal grant fund to the credit of the commissioner of human services in the
appropriate account upon certification by the commissioner of human services that the amounts
requested to be transferred have been earned or are required for the purposes of this section. Funds
received by the federal grant fund need not be budgeted as such, provided transfers from the fund
are budgeted for allotment purposes in the appropriate appropriation.
    Subd. 6. Wages. Notwithstanding section 177.24 or any other law to the contrary, wages paid to
patients working within this program are at the discretion of the commissioner of human services.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Restriction. Except when ordered by the court pursuant to a finding of necessity
to protect the life of the proposed patient or others, or as provided under subdivision 1a, no person
subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be confined in a jail or correctional institution, except
pursuant to chapter 242 or 244.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Exception. A person who is being petitioned for commitment under section 253B.185
and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision 2b or 7, may be
confined at a Department of Corrections or a county correctional or detention facility, rather than
a secure treatment facility, until a determination of the commitment petition as specified in this
subdivision.
   (a) A court may order that a person who is being petitioned for commitment under section
253B.185 be confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to the judicial hold order
under the following circumstances and conditions:
   (1) the person is currently serving a sentence in a Department of Corrections facility and the
court determines that the person has made a knowing and voluntary: (i) waiver of the right to be
8952                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [108TH DAY

held in a secure treatment facility; and (ii) election to be held in a Department of Corrections facility.
The order confining the person in the Department of Corrections facility shall remain in effect until
the court vacates the order or the person's criminal sentence and conditional release term expire.
In no case may the person be held in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant only to this
subdivision, and not pursuant to any separate correctional authority, for more than 210 days;
    (2) a person who has elected to be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this
subdivision may revoke the election by filing a written notice of intent to revoke the election with the
court and serving the notice upon the Department of Corrections and the county attorney. The court
shall order the person transferred to a secure treatment facility within 15 days of the date that the
notice of revocation was filed with the court, except that, if the person has additional time to serve
in prison at the end of the 15-day period, the person shall not be transferred to a secure treatment
facility until the person's prison term expires. After a person has revoked an election to remain in a
Department of Corrections facility under this subdivision, the court may not adopt another election
to remain in a Department of Corrections facility without the agreement of both parties and the
Department of Corrections;
    (3) upon petition by the commissioner of corrections, after notice to the parties and opportunity
for hearing and for good cause shown, the court may order that the person's place of confinement
be changed from the Department of Corrections to a secure treatment facility;
    (4) while at a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this subdivision, the person shall
remain subject to all rules and practices applicable to correctional inmates in the facility in which
the person is placed, including, but not limited to, the powers and duties of the commissioner of
corrections under section 241.01, powers relating to the use of force under section 243.52, and
the right of the commissioner of corrections to determine the place of confinement in a prison,
reformatory, or other facility;
    (5) a person may not be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this provision
beyond the end of the person's executed sentence or the end of any applicable conditional release
period, whichever is later. If a person confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to
this provision reaches the person's supervised release date and is subject to a period of conditional
release, the period of conditional release shall commence on the supervised release date even though
the person remains in the Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this provision. At the end
of the later of the executed sentence or any applicable conditional release period, the person shall
be transferred to a secure treatment facility; and
    (6) nothing in this section may be construed to establish a right of an inmate in a state
correctional facility to participate in sex offender treatment. This section must be construed in a
manner consistent with the provisions of section 244.03.
    (b) The committing county may offer a person who is being petitioned for commitment under
section 253B.185, and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision
2b or 7, the option to be held in a county correctional or detention facility rather than a secure
treatment facility, under such terms as may be agreed to by the county, the commitment petitioner,
and the commitment respondent. If a person makes such an election under this paragraph, the
court-hold order shall specify the terms of the agreement, including the conditions for revoking
the election.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
108TH DAY]                                     MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008                                                           8953

     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Facilities. Each county or a group of counties shall maintain or provide by contract
a facility for confinement of persons held temporarily for observation, evaluation, diagnosis,
treatment, and care. When the temporary confinement is provided at a regional treatment center,
the commissioner shall charge the county of financial responsibility for the costs of confinement of
persons hospitalized under section 253B.05, subdivisions 1 and 2, and section 253B.07, subdivision
2b, except that the commissioner shall bill the responsible health plan first. If the person has
health plan coverage, but the hospitalization does not meet the criteria in subdivision 6 or section
62M.07, 62Q.53, or 62Q.535, the county is responsible. When a person is temporarily confined in
a Department of Corrections facility solely under subdivision 1a, and not based on any separate
correctional authority:
   (1) the commissioner of corrections may charge the county of financial responsibility for the
costs of confinement; and
   (2) the Department of Human Services shall use existing appropriations to fund all remaining
nonconfinement costs. The funds received by the commissioner for the confinement and
nonconfinement costs are appropriated to the department for these purposes.
"County of financial responsibility" means the county in which the person resides at the time
of confinement or, if the person has no residence in this state, the county which initiated the
confinement. The charge for confinement in a facility operated by the commissioner of human
service shall be based on the commissioner's determination of the cost of care pursuant to section
246.50, subdivision 5. When there is a dispute as to which county is the county of financial
responsibility, the county charged for the costs of confinement shall pay for them pending final
determination of the dispute over financial responsibility. Disputes about the county of financial
responsibility shall be submitted to the commissioner to be settled in the manner prescribed in
section 256G.09.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.18, subdivision 4c, is amended to read:

plan, or otherwise permanently or temporarily releasing a person committed under this section or
section 253B.185 from a treatment facility, the head of the treatment facility shall make a reasonable
effort to notify any victim of a crime for which the person was convicted that the person may
be discharged or released and that the victim has a right to submit a written statement regarding
decisions of the medical director, special review board, or commissioner with respect to the person.
To the extent possible, the notice must be provided at least 14 days before any special review board
hearing or before a determination on a pass plan. Notwithstanding section 611A.06, subdivision 4,
the commissioner shall provide the judicial appeal panel with victim information in order to comply
with the provisions of this section. The judicial appeal panel shall ensure that the data on victims
remains private as provided for in section 611A.06, subdivision 4.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to victims who have requested notification by contacting, in
writing, the county attorney in the county where the conviction for the crime occurred. A county
attorney who receives a request for notification under this paragraph shall promptly forward the
request to the commissioner of human services.
    (e) The rights under this subdivision are in addition to rights available to a victim under chapter
611A. This provision does not give a victim all the rights of a "notified person" or a person "entitled
to statutory notice" under subdivision 4a, 4b, or 5.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 253B.185, subdivision 1b, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 1b. County attorney access to data. Notwithstanding sections 144.291 to 144.298;
245.467, subdivision 6; 245.4876, subdivision 7; 260B.171; 260B.235, subdivision 8; 260C.171;
and 609.749, subdivision 6, or any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, prior to filing a
petition for commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person,
and upon notice to the proposed patient, the county attorney or the county attorney's designee may
move the court for an order granting access to any records or data, to the extent it relates to the
proposed patient, for the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if
a petition is filed, to support the allegations set forth in the petition.
   The court may grant the motion if: (1) the Department of Corrections refers the case for
commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or a sexually dangerous person; or (2) upon a

showing that the requested category of data or records may be relevant to the determination by the
county attorney or designee. The court shall decide a motion under this subdivision within 48 hours
after a hearing on the motion. Notice to the proposed patient need not be given upon a showing
that such notice may result in harm or harassment of interested persons or potential witnesses.
Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, a county attorney considering the
civil commitment of a person under this section may obtain records and data from the Department
of Corrections or any probation or parole agency in this state upon request, without a court order,
for the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition, and if a petition is filed,
to support the allegations set forth in the petition. At the time of the request for the records, the
county attorney shall provide notice of the request to the person who is the subject of the records.
   Data collected pursuant to this subdivision shall retain their original status and, if not public, are
inadmissible in any court proceeding unrelated to civil commitment, unless otherwise permitted.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Financial responsibility. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state facility" has the
meaning given in section 246.50, and also includes a Department of Corrections facility when the
proposed patient is confined in such a facility pursuant to section 253B.045, subdivision 1a.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 246.54, 253B.045, and any other law to the contrary, when a
petition is filed for commitment under this section pursuant to the notice required in section 244.05,
subdivision 7, the state and county are each responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the person's
confinement at a state facility or county jail, prior to commitment.
    (c) The county shall submit an invoice to the state court administrator for reimbursement of the
state's share of the cost of confinement.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the state's responsibility for reimbursement is limited to the
amount appropriated for this purpose.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Petition for reduction in custody. (a) This subdivision applies only to committed
persons as defined in paragraph (b). The procedures in section 253B.18, subdivision 5a, for victim
notification and right to submit a statement under section 253B.18 apply to petitions filed and
reductions in custody recommended under this subdivision.
   (b) As used in this subdivision:
   (1) "committed person" means an individual committed under this section, or under this section
and under section 253B.18, as mentally ill and dangerous. It does not include persons committed
only as mentally ill and dangerous under section 253B.18; and
    (2) "reduction in custody" means transfer out of a secure treatment facility, a provisional
discharge, or a discharge from commitment.
   (c) A petition for a reduction in custody or an appeal of a revocation of provisional discharge

may be filed by either the committed person or by the head of the treatment facility and must be filed
with and considered by the special review board. A committed person may not petition the special
review board any sooner than six months following either:
    (1) the entry of judgment in the district court of the order for commitment issued under section
253B.18, subdivision 3, or upon the exhaustion of all related appeal rights in state court relating to
that order, whichever is later; or
    (2) any recommendation of the special review board or order of the judicial appeal panel, or
upon the exhaustion of all appeal rights in state court, whichever is later. The medical director may
petition at any time. The special review board proceedings are not contested cases as defined in
chapter 14.
    (d) The special review board shall hold a hearing on each petition before issuing a
recommendation under paragraph (f). Fourteen days before the hearing, the committing court,
the county attorney of the county of commitment, the designated agency, an interested person,
the petitioner and the petitioner's counsel, and the committed person and the committed person's
counsel must be given written notice by the commissioner of the time and place of the hearing
before the special review board. Only those entitled to statutory notice of the hearing or those
administratively required to attend may be present at the hearing. The patient may designate
interested persons to receive notice by providing the names and addresses to the commissioner at
least 21 days before the hearing.
    (e) A person or agency receiving notice that submits documentary evidence to the special
review board before the hearing must also provide copies to the committed person, the committed
person's counsel, the county attorney of the county of commitment, the case manager, and the
commissioner. The special review board must consider any statements received from victims under
section 253B.18, subdivision 5a.
    (f) Within 30 days of the hearing, the special review board shall issue written findings of fact
and shall recommend denial or approval of the petition to the judicial appeal panel established under
section 253B.19. The commissioner shall forward the recommendation of the special review board
to the judicial appeal panel and to every person entitled to statutory notice. No reduction in custody
or reversal of a revocation of provisional discharge recommended by the special review board is
effective until it has been reviewed by the judicial appeal panel and until 15 days after an order
from the judicial appeal panel affirming, modifying, or denying the recommendation.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256.01, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 2. Specific powers. Subject to the provisions of section 241.021, subdivision 2, the
commissioner of human services shall carry out the specific duties in paragraphs (a) through (cc):
8960                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

    (a) Administer and supervise all forms of public assistance provided for by state law and other
welfare activities or services as are vested in the commissioner. Administration and supervision of
human services activities or services includes, but is not limited to, assuring timely and accurate
distribution of benefits, completeness of service, and quality program management. In addition
to administering and supervising human services activities vested by law in the department, the
commissioner shall have the authority to:
   (1) require county agency participation in training and technical assistance programs to promote
compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations, and policies governing human services;
   (2) monitor, on an ongoing basis, the performance of county agencies in the operation and
administration of human services, enforce compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations,
and policies governing welfare services and promote excellence of administration and program
operation;
   (3) develop a quality control program or other monitoring program to review county performance
and accuracy of benefit determinations;
    (4) require county agencies to make an adjustment to the public assistance benefits issued to any
individual consistent with federal law and regulation and state law and rule and to issue or recover
benefits as appropriate;
   (5) delay or deny payment of all or part of the state and federal share of benefits and
administrative reimbursement according to the procedures set forth in section 256.017;
   (6) make contracts with and grants to public and private agencies and organizations, both profit
and nonprofit, and individuals, using appropriated funds; and
    (7) enter into contractual agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes with a reservation
in Minnesota to the extent necessary for the tribe to operate a federally approved family assistance
program or any other program under the supervision of the commissioner. The commissioner shall
consult with the affected county or counties in the contractual agreement negotiations, if the county
or counties wish to be included, in order to avoid the duplication of county and tribal assistance
program services. The commissioner may establish necessary accounts for the purposes of receiving
and disbursing funds as necessary for the operation of the programs.
   (b) Inform county agencies, on a timely basis, of changes in statute, rule, federal law, regulation,
and policy necessary to county agency administration of the programs.
     (c) Administer and supervise all child welfare activities; promote the enforcement of laws
protecting disabled, dependent, neglected and delinquent children, and children born to mothers
who were not married to the children's fathers at the times of the conception nor at the births of the
children; license and supervise child-caring and child-placing agencies and institutions; supervise
the care of children in boarding and foster homes or in private institutions; and generally perform
all functions relating to the field of child welfare now vested in the State Board of Control.
    (d) Administer and supervise all noninstitutional service to disabled persons, including those
who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or physically impaired or otherwise disabled. The
commissioner may provide and contract for the care and treatment of qualified indigent children in
facilities other than those located and available at state hospitals when it is not feasible to provide
the service in state hospitals.
108TH DAY]                         MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008                                       8961

   (e) Assist and actively cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, local, state,
and federal, by performing services in conformity with the purposes of Laws 1939, chapter 431.
    (f) Act as the agent of and cooperate with the federal government in matters of mutual concern
relative to and in conformity with the provisions of Laws 1939, chapter 431, including the
administration of any federal funds granted to the state to aid in the performance of any functions
of the commissioner as specified in Laws 1939, chapter 431, and including the promulgation of
rules making uniformly available medical care benefits to all recipients of public assistance, at such
times as the federal government increases its participation in assistance expenditures for medical
care to recipients of public assistance, the cost thereof to be borne in the same proportion as are
grants of aid to said recipients.
   (g) Establish and maintain any administrative units reasonably necessary for the performance of
administrative functions common to all divisions of the department.
    (h) Act as designated guardian of both the estate and the person of all the wards of the state
of Minnesota, whether by operation of law or by an order of court, without any further act or
proceeding whatever, except as to persons committed as developmentally disabled. For children
under the guardianship of the commissioner or a tribe in Minnesota recognized by the Secretary
of the Interior whose interests would be best served by adoptive placement, the commissioner
may contract with a licensed child-placing agency or a Minnesota tribal social services agency
to provide adoption services. A contract with a licensed child-placing agency must be designed
to supplement existing county efforts and may not replace existing county programs or tribal
social services, unless the replacement is agreed to by the county board and the appropriate
exclusive bargaining representative, tribal governing body, or the commissioner has evidence that
child placements of the county continue to be substantially below that of other counties. Funds
encumbered and obligated under an agreement for a specific child shall remain available until the
terms of the agreement are fulfilled or the agreement is terminated.
   (i) Act as coordinating referral and informational center on requests for service for newly arrived
immigrants coming to Minnesota.
   (j) The specific enumeration of powers and duties as hereinabove set forth shall in no way be
construed to be a limitation upon the general transfer of powers herein contained.
   (k) Establish county, regional, or statewide schedules of maximum fees and charges which may
be paid by county agencies for medical, dental, surgical, hospital, nursing and nursing home care
and medicine and medical supplies under all programs of medical care provided by the state and for
congregate living care under the income maintenance programs.
    (l) Have the authority to conduct and administer experimental projects to test methods and
procedures of administering assistance and services to recipients or potential recipients of public
welfare. To carry out such experimental projects, it is further provided that the commissioner
of human services is authorized to waive the enforcement of existing specific statutory program
requirements, rules, and standards in one or more counties. The order establishing the waiver
shall provide alternative methods and procedures of administration, shall not be in conflict with
the basic purposes, coverage, or benefits provided by law, and in no event shall the duration of a
project exceed four years. It is further provided that no order establishing an experimental project
as authorized by the provisions of this section shall become effective until the following conditions
have been met:
8962                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [108TH DAY

   (1) the secretary of health and human services of the United States has agreed, for the same
project, to waive state plan requirements relative to statewide uniformity; and
  (2) a comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs, shall be approved by the Legislative
Advisory Commission and filed with the commissioner of administration.
   (m) According to federal requirements, establish procedures to be followed by local welfare
boards in creating citizen advisory committees, including procedures for selection of committee
members.
    (n) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions which are based on quality control error
rates for the aid to families with dependent children program formerly codified in sections 256.72
to 256.87, medical assistance, or food stamp program in the following manner:
    (1) one-half of the total amount of the disallowance shall be borne by the county boards
responsible for administering the programs. For the medical assistance and the AFDC program
formerly codified in sections 256.72 to 256.87, disallowances shall be shared by each county
board in the same proportion as that county's expenditures for the sanctioned program are to the
total of all counties' expenditures for the AFDC program formerly codified in sections 256.72 to
256.87, and medical assistance programs. For the food stamp program, sanctions shall be shared
by each county board, with 50 percent of the sanction being distributed to each county in the same
proportion as that county's administrative costs for food stamps are to the total of all food stamp
administrative costs for all counties, and 50 percent of the sanctions being distributed to each
county in the same proportion as that county's value of food stamp benefits issued are to the total
of all benefits issued for all counties. Each county shall pay its share of the disallowance to the
state of Minnesota. When a county fails to pay the amount due hereunder, the commissioner may
deduct the amount from reimbursement otherwise due the county, or the attorney general, upon the
request of the commissioner, may institute civil action to recover the amount due; and
    (2) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (1), if the disallowance results from knowing
noncompliance by one or more counties with a specific program instruction, and that knowing
noncompliance is a matter of official county board record, the commissioner may require payment
or recover from the county or counties, in the manner prescribed in clause (1), an amount equal to
the portion of the total disallowance which resulted from the noncompliance, and may distribute
the balance of the disallowance according to clause (1).
    (o) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the
recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may
enter into contracts with third parties. Any recoveries that result from projects or contracts entered
into under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account
until the balance in the account reaches $1,000,000. When the balance in the account exceeds
$1,000,000, the excess shall be transferred and credited to the general fund. All money in the
account is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this paragraph.
     (p) Have the authority to make direct payments to facilities providing shelter to women and their
children according to section 256D.05, subdivision 3. Upon the written request of a shelter facility
that has been denied payments under section 256D.05, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall review
all relevant evidence and make a determination within 30 days of the request for review regarding
issuance of direct payments to the shelter facility. Failure to act within 30 days shall be considered
a determination not to issue direct payments.
108TH DAY]                                   MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008                                                        8963

    (q) Have the authority to establish and enforce the following county reporting requirements:
    (1) the commissioner shall establish fiscal and statistical reporting requirements necessary to
account for the expenditure of funds allocated to counties for human services programs. When
establishing financial and statistical reporting requirements, the commissioner shall evaluate all
reports, in consultation with the counties, to determine if the reports can be simplified or the number
of reports can be reduced;
    (2) the county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required
by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the
month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless
the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid
jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports
that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner;
   (3) if the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (2), the
commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next
reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late
report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county
boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal
funding is received;
    (4) a county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required
format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county
board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason
the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective
action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan
must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received
notice of noncompliance;
    (5) the final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date
the report was originally due. If the commissioner does not receive a report by the final deadline, the
county board forfeits the funding associated with the report for that reporting period and the county
board must repay any funds associated with the report received for that reporting period;
     (6) the commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under
clause (3) or (5) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate
forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements.
If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5), the
county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69; and
   (7) counties subject to withholding of funds under clause (3) or forfeiture or repayment of funds
under clause (5) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred
due to actions taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5).
    (r) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions when federal fiscal
disallowances or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample ­                           fo

or when the applicant or participant disputes the loan value listed in the guidebook as unreasonable
given the condition of the particular vehicle, the county agency may require the applicant or
participant document the loan value by securing a written statement from a motor vehicle dealer
licensed under section 168.27, stating the amount that the dealer would pay to purchase the vehicle.
The county agency shall reimburse the applicant or participant for the cost of a written statement
that documents a lower loan value;
   (2) the value of life insurance policies for members of the assistance unit;
   (3) one burial plot per member of an assistance unit;

are essential for the self-employment business;
   (5) the value of personal property not otherwise specified which is commonly used by household
members in day-to-day living such as clothing, necessary household furniture, equipment, and other
basic maintenance items essential for daily living;
   (6) the value of real and personal property owned by a recipient of Supplemental Security Income
or Minnesota supplemental aid;
   (7) the value of corrective payments, but only for the month in which the payment is received

assistance payments are made on their behalf; and
   (19) the assets of persons whose income is excluded under section 256J.21, subdivision 2, clause
(43).

    The commissioner shall annually publish in the State Register the transitional standard for an
assistance unit sizes 1 to 10 including a breakdown of the cash and food portions.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.425, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility. (a) To be eligible for a hardship extension, a participant in an
assistance unit subject to the time limit under section 256J.42, subdivision 1, must be in compliance
in the participant's 60th counted month. For purposes of determining eligibility for a hardship
extension, a participant is in compliance in any month that the participant has not been sanctioned.
In order to maintain eligibility for any of the hardship extension categories a participant shall
develop and comply with either an employment plan or a family stabilization services plan,
whichever is appropriate.
    (b) If one participant in a two-parent assistance unit is determined to be ineligible for a hardship
extension, the county shall give the assistance unit the option of disqualifying the ineligible
participant from MFIP. In that case, the assistance unit shall be treated as a one-parent assistance
unit and the assistance unit's MFIP grant shall be calculated using the shared household standard
under section 256J.08, subdivision 82a.
   (c) Prior to denying an extension, the county must review the sanction status and determine
whether the sanction is appropriate or if good cause exists under section 256J.57. If the sanction
was inappropriately applied or the participant is granted a good cause exception before the end of
month 60, the participant shall be considered for an extension.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256J.49, subdivision 13, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 13. Work activity. "Work activity" means any activity in a participant's approved
employment plan that leads to employment. For purposes of the MFIP program, this includes
activities that meet the definition of work activity under the participation requirements of TANF.
Work activity includes:
    (1) unsubsidized employment, including work study and paid apprenticeships or internships;
    (2) subsidized private sector or public sector employment, including grant diversion as specified
in section 256J.69, on-the-job training as specified in section 256J.66, ­h                 t­­

to participating in unpaid work experience, the participant's employment plan may only include
unpaid work experience if including the unpaid work experience in the plan will meet the following
criteria:
    (i) the unpaid work experience will provide the participant specific skills or experience that
cannot be obtained through other work activity options where the participant resides or is willing to
reside; and
   (ii) the skills or experience gained through the unpaid work experience will result in higher
wages for the participant than the participant could earn without the unpaid work experience;
   (4) job search including job readiness assistance, job clubs, job placement, job-related
counseling, and job retention services;
     (5) job readiness education, including English as a second language (ESL) or functional work
literacy classes as limited by the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 2, general educational
development (GED) course work, high school completion, and adult basic education as limited by
the provisions of section 256J.531, subdivision 1;
    (6) job skills training directly related to employment, including education and training that can
reasonably be expected to lead to employment, as limited by the provisions of section 256J.53;
     (7) providing child care services to a participant who is working in a community service program;
   (8) activities included in the employment plan that is developed under section 256J.521,
subdivision 3; and
    (9) preemployment activities including chemical and mental health assessments, treatment, and
services; learning disabilities services; child protective services; family stabilization services; or
other programs designed to enhance employability.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.521, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Self-employment. (a) Self-employment activities may be included in an employment
plan contingent on the development of a business plan which establishes a timetable and earning
goals that will result in the participant exiting MFIP assistance. Business plans must be developed
with assistance from an individual or organization with expertise in small business as approved by
the job counselor.
   (b) Participants with an approved plan that includes self-employment must meet the participation
requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1. Only hours where the participant earns at least
minimum wage shall be counted toward the requirement. Additional activities and hours necessary
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, must be included in the
employment plan.

months. Participants who fail, without good cause, to make satisfactory progress as established in the
business plan must revise the employment plan to replace the self-employment with other approved
work activities.

Minor parents, or 18- or 19-year-old parents without a high school diploma or its equivalent who
chooses an employment plan with an education option must attend school unless:
     (1) transportation services needed to enable the caregiver to attend school are not available;
   (2) appropriate child care services needed to enable the caregiver to attend school are not
available;
     (3) the caregiver is ill or incapacitated seriously enough to prevent attendance at school; or
    (4) the caregiver is needed in the home because of the illness or incapacity of another member
of the household. This includes a caregiver of a child who is younger than six weeks of age.
    (b) The caregiver must be enrolled in a secondary school and meeting the school's attendance
requirements. The county, social service agency, or job counselor must verify at least once per
quarter that the caregiver is meeting the school's attendance requirements. An enrolled caregiver
is considered to be meeting the attendance requirements when the school is not in regular session,
including during holiday and summer breaks.

       "Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
      Subd. 3a. County authority. (a) The commissioner, when implementing the general assistance
medical care, or medical assistance prepayment program within a county, must include the county
board in the process of development, approval, and issuance of the request for proposals to provide
services to eligible individuals within the proposed county. County boards must be given reasonable
opportunity to make recommendations regarding the development, issuance, review of responses,
and changes needed in the request for proposals. The commissioner must provide county boards the
opportunity to review each proposal based on the identification of community needs under chapters
145A and 256E and county advocacy activities. If a county board finds that a proposal does not
address certain community needs, the county board and commissioner shall continue efforts for
improving the proposal and network prior to the approval of the contract. The county board shall
make recommendations regarding the approval of local networks and their operations to ensure
adequate availability and access to covered services. The provider or health plan must respond
directly to county advocates and the state prepaid medical assistance ombudsperson regarding
service delivery and must be accountable to the state regarding contracts with medical assistance
and general assistance medical care funds. The county board may recommend a maximum number
of participating health plans after considering the size of the enrolling population; ensuring
adequate access and capacity; considering the client and county administrative complexity; and
considering the need to promote the viability of locally developed health plans. The county board
or a single entity representing a group of county boards and the commissioner shall mutually select
health plans for participation at the time of initial implementation of the prepaid medical assistance
program in that county or group of counties and at the time of contract renewal. The commissioner
shall also seek input for contract requirements from the county or single entity representing a group
of county boards at each contract renewal and incorporate those recommendations into the contract
negotiation process. T                  ­h ­­e­­co­m ­m  ­ ­s i­­s­o

the achievement of local public health goals to meet the health needs of medical assistance and
general assistance medical care enrollees. These requirements must be reasonably related to the
performance of health plan functions and within the scope of the medical assistance and general
assistance medical care benefit sets. If the county board and the commissioner mutually agree to such
requirements, the department shall include such requirements in all health plan contracts governing
the prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care programs in that county at initial
implementation of the program in that county and at the time of contract renewal. The county board
may participate in the enforcement of the contract provisions related to local public health goals.
    (c) For counties in which prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care
programs have not been established, the commissioner shall not implement those programs if
a county board submits acceptable and timely preliminary and final proposals under section
256B.692, until county-based purchasing is no longer operational in that county. For counties in
which prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care programs are in existence on
or after September 1, 1997, the commissioner must terminate contracts with health plans according
to section 256B.692, subdivision 5, if the county board submits and the commissioner accepts
preliminary and final proposals according to that subdivision. The commissioner is not required to
terminate contracts that begin on or after September 1, 1997, according to section 256B.692 until
two years have elapsed from the date of initial enrollment.
     (d) In the event that a county board or a single entity representing a group of county boards
and the commissioner cannot reach agreement regarding: (i) the selection of participating health
plans in that county; (ii) contract requirements; or (iii) implementation and enforcement of county
requirements including provisions regarding local public health goals, the commissioner shall
resolve all disputes after taking into account the recommendations of a three-person mediation
panel. The panel shall be composed of one designee of the president of the association of
Minnesota counties, one designee of the commissioner of human services, and one ­          d­e­

county-based purchasing, it is prohibited from assuming the responsibility of county-based
purchasing for a period of five years from the date it discontinues purchasing.

to use single-health plan, county-based purchasing arrangements for medical assistance and
general assistance medical care managed care programs and products for the counties that were
in single-health plan, county-based purchasing arrangements on March 1, 2008. This paragraph
does not require the commissioner to terminate an existing contract with a noncounty-based
purchasing health plan that had enrollment in a medical assistance program or product in these
counties on March 1, 2008. This paragraph expires on December 31, 2010, or the effective date of
new contracts for medical assistance and general assistance medical care managed care programs
entered into at the conclusion of the commissioner's next scheduled reprocurement process for the
county-based purchasing entities covered by this paragraph, whichever is later.
       (b) The commissioner shall consider, and may approve, contracting on a single-health plan
basis with other county-based purchasing plans, or with other qualified health plans that have
coordination arrangements with counties, to serve persons with a disability who voluntarily enroll,
in order to promote better coordination or integration of health care services, social services
and other community-based services, provided that all requirements applicable to health plan
purchasing, including those in Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, are satisfied.

108TH DAY]                                                   MONDAY, APRIL 28, 2008                                                                                 8981

    (c) A permit once granted continues in full force and effect until abandoned or unless suspended
or revoked, subject to compliance by the permit holder with the applicable provisions of law and
the rules of the commissioner governing permit carriers.
    (d) No permit may be issued to a common carrier by rail permitting the common carrier to operate
trucks for hire within this state, nor may a common carrier by rail be permitted to own, lease, operate,
control, or have an interest in a permit carrier by truck, either by stock ownership or otherwise,
directly, indirectly, through a holding company, or by stockholders or directors in common, or in
any other manner. Nothing in sections 221.011 to 221.291 prevents the commissioner from issuing a
permit to a common carrier by rail authorizing the carrier to operate trucks wholly within the limits
of a municipality or within adjacent or contiguous municipalities or a common rate point served by
the railroad and only as a service supplementary to the rail service now established by the carriers.
      Sec. 94. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 221.121, subdivision 6a, is amended to read:
      Subd. 6a. Household goods carrier. A person who desires to hold out or to operate as a carrier

be assigned or transferred but only upon the order of the commissioner approving the transfer or
assignment after notice and hearing.
      (b) The proposed seller and buyer or lessor and lessee of a permit, except for livestock carrier
permits, shall file a joint notarized petition with the commissioner setting forth the name and address
of the parties, the identifying number of the permit, and the description of the authority which the
parties seek to sell or lease, a short statement of the reasons for the proposed sale or lease, a statement
of outstanding claims of creditors which are directly attributable to the operation to be conducted
under the permit, a copy of the contract of sale or lease, and a financial statement with a balance
sheet and an income statement, if existent, of the buyer or lessee. If it appears to the commissioner,                     ­

   (c) The commissioner shall look to the substance of the transaction rather than the form. An
agreement for the transfer or sale of a permit must be reported and filed with the commissioner
within 30 days of the agreement.
    (d) If an authority to operate as a permit carrier is held by a corporation, a sale, assignment,
pledge, or other transfer of the stock interest in the corporation which will accomplish a substantial
or material change or transfer of the majority ownership of the corporation, as exercised through its
stockholders, must be reported in the manner prescribed in the rules of the commissioner within 30
days after the sale, assignment, pledge, or other transfer of stock. The commissioner shall then make
a finding whether or not the stock transfer does, in fact, constitute a sale, lease, or other transfer of
the permit of the corporation to a new party or parties and, if they so find, then the continuance of the
permit issued to the corporation may only be upon the corporation's complying with the standards
and procedures otherwise imposed by this section."
