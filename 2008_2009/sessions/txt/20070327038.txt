INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.
    A utility that owns a nuclear generating plant may propose to the commission electric and natural
gas infrastructure improvements that result in the reduction of greenhouse gases. The commission
may approve proposals if it determines, after notice and comment, that the project is consistent with
the public interest and appropriately reduces greenhouse gases from the utility's electric or natural
gas generating, transmission, or distribution assets without excessive cost. The commission shall
provide timely recovery of the utility's costs of any approved projects through a rate adjustment
similar to that provided for transmission projects under section 216B.16, subdivision 7b."
