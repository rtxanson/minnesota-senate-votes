The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 2688, Chapter 172, the bill removing some independent
contractors from the law defining independent contractor status for the trucking industry.
Under current law, there is a specific standard that applies to determining whether owners-operators
in the trucking industry are independent contractors. The standard involves six clearly defined
criteria that are specific to the nature of work performed by individual owner-operators in the
100TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2008                                         8495

trucking industry.
This bill singles out owner-operators who "deliver shipments less than 250 pounds per parcel" for
different treatment than other carriers. Nothing in connection with the existing criteria would suggest
that the criteria are more or less appropriate for the industry on the basis of the size or weight of the
individual items being transported. The weight designation of 250 pounds is an arbitrary distinction
with no rational basis and would result in treating similarly situated businesses to different standards.
The distinction used in the bill does not define "parcel," which can mean either a distinct bundle
such as a package or more broadly any distinct item of a whole. Accordingly, this provision could
apply to any owner-operator who transports items that independently weigh less than 250 pounds.
This ambiguity will certainly create unwarranted confusion in the industry.
Current law appears adequate to address the needs of this industry. Moreover, a recent analysis by
the legislative auditor found that the percentage of misclassified individuals in this industry is no
greater than other industries.
                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2688 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.
