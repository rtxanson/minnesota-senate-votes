adopt rules consistent with sections 116C.91 to 116C.96 that require an environmental assessment

    Subd. 2. Federal oversight. (a) If the board determines, upon its own volition or at the
request of any person, that a federal program exists for regulating the release of certain genetically
engineered organisms and the federal oversight under the program is adequate to protect human
health or the environment, then any person may release such genetically engineered organisms
after obtaining the necessary federal approval and without obtaining a state release permit or a
significant environmental permit or complying with the other requirements of sections 116C.91 to
116C.96 and the rules of the board adopted pursuant to section 116C.94.
    (b) If the board determines the federal program is adequate to meet only certain requirements
of sections 116C.91 to 116C.96 and the rules of the board adopted pursuant to section 116C.94, the

    (c) A person proposing a release for which a federal authorization is required may apply to the
board for an exemption from the board's permit or to a state agency with a significant environmental
permit for the proposed release for an exemption from the agency's permit. The proposer must file
with the board or state agency a written request for exemption with a copy of the federal application
and the information necessary to determine if there is a potential for significant environmental effects
under chapter 116D and rules adopted under it. The board or state agency shall give public notice
of the request in the first available issue of the EQB Monitor and shall provide an opportunity
for public comment on the environmental review process consistent with chapter 116D and rules
adopted under it. The board or state agency may grant the exemption if the board or state agency
finds that the federal authorization issued is adequate to meet the requirements of chapter 116D and
rules adopted under it and any other requirement of the board's or state agency's authority regarding
the release of genetically engineered organisms. The board or state agency must grant or deny the
exemption within 45 days after the receipt of the written request and the information required by

service providers.
