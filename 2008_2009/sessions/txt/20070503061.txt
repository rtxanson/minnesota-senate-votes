of reproducing x-rays, plus no more than $10 for the time spent retrieving and copying the x-rays.
    (c) The respective maximum charges of 75 cents per page and $10 for time provided in this

61ST DAY]                            THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2007                                         2729

    Subd. 3. Release from one provider to another. A patient's health record, including, but not
limited to, laboratory reports, x-rays, prescriptions, and other technical information used in assessing
the patient's condition, or the pertinent portion of the record relating to a specific condition, or a
summary of the record, shall promptly be furnished to another provider upon the written request of
the patient. The written request shall specify the name of the provider to whom the health record
is to be furnished. The provider who furnishes the health record or summary may retain a copy of
the materials furnished. The patient shall be responsible for the reasonable costs of furnishing the
information.
    Subd. 4. Duration of consent. Except as provided in this section, a consent is valid for one year
or for a lesser period specified in the consent or for a different period provided by law.
   Subd. 5. Exceptions to consent requirement. This section does not prohibit the release of health
records:
    (1) for a medical emergency when the provider is unable to obtain the patient's consent due to
the patient's condition or the nature of the medical emergency;
    (2) to other providers within related health care entities when necessary for the current treatment
of the patient; or
    (3) to a health care facility licensed by this chapter, chapter 144A, or to the same types of health
care facilities licensed by this chapter and chapter 144A that are licensed in another state when a
patient:
   (i) is returning to the health care facility and unable to provide consent; or
   (ii) who resides in the health care facility, has services provided by an outside resource under
Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.75(h), and is unable to provide consent.
    Subd. 6. Consent does not expire. Notwithstanding subdivision 4, if a patient explicitly gives
informed consent to the release of health records for the purposes and restrictions in clauses (1) and
(2), the consent does not expire after one year for:
   (1) the release of health records to a provider who is being advised or consulted with in
connection with the releasing provider's current treatment of the patient;
    (2) the release of health records to an accident and health insurer, health service plan corporation,
health maintenance organization, or third-party administrator for purposes of payment of claims,
fraud investigation, or quality of care review and studies, provided that:
   (i) the use or release of the records complies with sections 72A.49 to 72A.505;
    (ii) further use or release of the records in individually identifiable form to a person other than
the patient without the patient's consent is prohibited; and
    (iii) the recipient establishes adequate safeguards to protect the records from unauthorized
disclosure, including a procedure for removal or destruction of information that identifies the
patient.
    Subd. 7. Exception to consent. Subdivision 2 does not apply to the release of health records
to the commissioner of health or the Health Data Institute under chapter 62J, provided that the
2730                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [61ST DAY

commissioner encrypts the patient identifier upon receipt of the data.
    Subd. 8. Record locator service. (a) A provider or group purchaser may release patient
identifying information and information about the location of the patient's health records to a record
locator service without consent from the patient, unless the patient has elected to be excluded from
the service under paragraph (d). Only a provider may have access to patient identifying information
in a record locator service. Except in the case of a medical emergency, a provider participating
in a health information exchange using a record locator service does not have access to patient
identifying information and information about the location of the patient's health records unless the
patient specifically consents to the access. A consent does not expire but may be revoked by the
patient at any time by providing written notice of the revocation to the provider.
    (b) A health information exchange maintaining a record locator service must maintain an audit
log of providers accessing information in a record locator service that at least contains information
on:
   (1) the identity of the provider accessing the information;
   (2) the identity of the patient whose information was accessed by the provider; and
   (3) the date the information was accessed.
    (c) No group purchaser may in any way require a provider to participate in a record locator
service as a condition of payment or participation.
    (d) A provider or an entity operating a record locator service must provide a mechanism under
which patients may exclude their identifying information and information about the location of their
health records from a record locator service. At a minimum, a consent form that permits a provider
to access a record locator service must include a conspicuous check-box option that allows a patient
to exclude all of the patient's information from the record locator service. A provider participating
in a health information exchange with a record locator service who receives a patient's request to
exclude all of the patient's information from the record locator service or to have a specific provider
contact excluded from the record locator service is responsible for removing that information from
the record locator service.
    Subd. 9. Documentation of release. In cases where a provider releases health records without
patient consent as authorized by law, the release must be documented in the patient's health record.
In the case of a release under section 144.294, subdivision 2, the documentation must include the
date and circumstances under which the release was made, the person or agency to whom the release
was made, and the records that were released.
   Subd. 10. Warranties regarding consents, requests, and disclosures. (a) When requesting
health records using consent, a person warrants that the consent:
   (1) contains no information known to the person to be false; and
   (2) accurately states the patient's desire to have health records disclosed or that there is specific
authorization in law.
   (b) When requesting health records using consent, a provider warrants that the request:
   (1) contains no information known to the provider to be false;
61ST DAY]                             THURSDAY, MAY 3, 2007                                         2731

   (2) accurately states the patient's desire to have health records disclosed or that there is specific
authorization in law; and
      (3) does not exceed any limits imposed by the patient in the consent.
      (c) When disclosing health records, a person releasing health records warrants that the person:
      (1) has complied with the requirements of this section regarding disclosure of health records;
      (2) knows of no information related to the request that is false; and
      (3) has complied with the limits set by the patient in the consent.
      Sec. 4. [144.294] RECORDS RELATING TO MENTAL HEALTH.
    Subdivision 1. Provider inquiry. Upon the written request of a spouse, parent, child, or sibling
of a patient being evaluated for or diagnosed with mental illness, a provider shall inquire of a patient
whether the patient wishes to authorize a specific individual to receive information regarding the
patient's current and proposed course of treatment. If the patient so authorizes, the provider shall
communicate to the designated individual the patient's current and proposed course of treatment.
Section 144.293, subdivisions 2 and 4, apply to consents given under this subdivision.
    Subd. 2. Disclosure to law enforcement agency. Notwithstanding section 144.293,
subdivisions 2 and 4, a provider must disclose health records relating to a patient's mental health
to a law enforcement agency if the law enforcement agency provides the name of the patient and
communicates that the:
      (1) patient is currently involved in an emergency interaction with the law enforcement agency;
and
   (2) disclosure of the records is necessary to protect the health or safety of the patient or of another
person.
    The scope of disclosure under this subdivision is limited to the minimum necessary for law
enforcement to respond to the emergency. A law enforcement agency that obtains health records

facility with x-ray equipment for use on humans that is registered under subdivision 1 may not
operate, nor may the facility allow the individual to operate, x-ray equipment unless the individual
has passed a national examination for limited x-ray machine operators that meets the requirements
of paragraphs (b) and (c) and is approved by the commissioner of health.
    (b) The commissioner shall establish criteria for the approval of examinations based on national
standards, such as the examination in radiography from the American Registry of Radiologic
Technologists, the examination for limited scope of practice in radiography from the American
Registry of Radiologic Technologists for limited x-ray machine operators, and the American
Registry of Chiropractic Radiography Technologists for limited radiography in spines and
extremities; or equivalent examinations approved by other states. Equivalent examinations may be
approved by the commissioner, if the examination is consistent with the standards for educational
and psychological testing as recommended by the American Education Research Association, the
American Psychological Association, the National Council on Measurement in Education, or the
National Commission for Certifying Agencies. The organization proposing the use of an equivalent
examination shall submit a fee to the commissioner of $1,000 per examination to cover the cost of
determining the extent to which the examination meets the examining standards. The collected fee
shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the state government special revenue fund.
      (c) The examination for limited x-ray machine operators must include:
   (1) radiation protection, equipment maintenance and operation, image production and
evaluation, and patient care and management; and
    (2) at least one of the following regions of the human anatomy: chest, extremities, skull and
sinus, spine, or ankle and foot. The examinations must include the anatomy of, and positioning for,
the specific regions.
    (d) A limited x-ray operator who is required to take an examination under this subdivision
must submit to the commissioner an application for the examination, a $25 processing fee, and
the required examination fee set by the national organization offering the examination. The
processing fee and the examination fee shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the
state government special revenue fund. The commissioner shall submit the fee to the national
organization providing the examination.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.121, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5a. Limited x-ray machine operator practice. (a) A limited x-ray operator may only
practice medical radiography on limited regions of the human anatomy for which the operator has
successfully passed an examination identified in subdivision 5, unless the operator meets one of the
exemptions described in paragraph (b). The operator may practice using only routine radiographic
procedures, for the interpretation by and under the direction of a licensed practitioner, excluding
computed tomography, the use of contrast media, and the use of fluoroscopic or mammographic
equipment.

   (b) This subdivision does not apply to:
   (1) limited x-ray machine operators who passed the examination that was required before
January 1, 2008;
    (2) certified radiologic technologists, licensed dental hygienists, registered dental assistants,
certified registered nurse anesthetists, and registered physician assistants;
   (3) individuals who are licensed in Minnesota to practice medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic,

(2) or (3) for the duration and within the scope of the training course.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.121, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Variance of scope of practice. The commissioner may grant a variance according
to Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7000 to 4717.7050, to a facility for the scope of practice of an
x-ray operator in cases where the delivery of health care would otherwise be compromised if a
variance were not granted. The request for a variance must be in writing, state the circumstances that
constitute hardship, state the period of time the facility wishes to have the variance for the scope of
practice in place, and state the alternative measures that will be taken if the variance is granted. The
commissioner shall set forth in writing the reasons for granting or denying the variance. Variances
granted by the commissioner specify in writing the time limitation and required alternative measures
to be taken by the facility. A request for the variance shall be denied if the commissioner finds the
circumstances stated by the facility do not support a claim of hardship, the requested time period
for the variance is unreasonable, the alternative measures proposed by the facility are not equivalent
to the scope of practice, or the request for the variance is not submitted to the commissioner in a
timely manner.
   Sec. 4. APPROPRIATIONS.
    $10,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2008 and $5,000 is appropriated in fiscal year 2009 from
the state government special revenue fund to the commissioner of health for the purpose of the
examination procedures for individuals operating x-ray equipment.
