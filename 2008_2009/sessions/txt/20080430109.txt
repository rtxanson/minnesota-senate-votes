systems, holding tanks, and privies on land that is owned or leased by the farmer; or
   (4) an individual who performs labor or services for a person licensed under this section in

such conditions as it may prescribe for the prevention of pollution, for the storage, collection,
transportation, processing, or disposal of waste, or for the installation or operation of any system or
facility, or any part thereof, related to the storage, collection, transportation, processing, or disposal
of waste.
     The agency may not issue a new permit to a new facility located in a community in a city of the
first class in Hennepin County that meets all of the following conditions:

pollution.
    (b) The Pollution Control Agency has the authority for approval over the siting, expansion,
or operation of a solid waste facility with regard to environmental issues. However, the agency's
issuance of a permit does not release the permittee from any liability, penalty, or duty imposed by any
applicable county ordinances. Nothing in this chapter precludes, or shall be construed to preclude,
a county from enforcing land use controls, regulations, and ordinances existing at the time of the
permit application and adopted pursuant to sections 366.10 to 366.181, 394.21 to 394.37, or 462.351

   Section 1. [84.66] MINNESOTA FORESTS FOR THE FUTURE PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose. The Minnesota forests for the future program identifies and protects
private, working forest lands for their timber, scenic, recreational, fish and wildlife habitat,
threatened and endangered species, and other cultural and environmental values.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given:
   (1) "forest land" has the meaning given under section 89.001, subdivision 4;
   (2) "forest resources" has the meaning given under section 89.001, subdivision 8;
   (3) "guidelines" has the meaning given under section 89A.01, subdivision 8;
   (4) "riparian land" has the meaning given under section 103F.511, subdivision 8a; and
    (5) "working forest land" means land that provides a broad range of goods and services, including
forest products, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, clean air and water, and carbon sequestration.
   Subd. 3. Establishment. The commissioner of natural resources shall establish and administer
a Minnesota forests for the future program. Land selected for inclusion in the program shall be
evaluated on the land's potential for:
   (1) producing timber and other forest products;
   (2) maintaining forest landscapes;
   (3) providing public recreation; and
   (4) providing ecological, fish and wildlife habitat, other cultural and environmental values, and
values consistent with working forest lands.
     Subd. 4. Land eligibility. Land may be placed in the Minnesota forests for the future program
if it:
   (1) is:
   (i) forest land;
   (ii) desirable land adjacent to forest land, as determined by the commissioner; or
   (iii) beneficial to forest resource protection;
    (2) is at least five acres in size, except for a riparian area or an area providing access to state
forest land; and
    (3) is not set aside, enrolled, or diverted under another federal or state program, unless enrollment
in the Minnesota forests for the future program would provide additional conservation benefits or a
longer enrollment term than under the current federal or state program.
   Subd. 5. Land interests. The commissioner may acquire permanent interests in lands by fee title,
easement acquisition, gift, or donation. An acquired easement shall require a forestry management
plan unless the requirement is waived or modified by the commissioner. The plan will guide forest
9032                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [109TH DAY

management activities consistent with the purposes and terms of the easement and shall incorporate
guidelines and other forest management practices as determined by the commissioner to provide
perpetuation of the forest. The plan shall be developed in accordance with the guidelines.
    Subd. 6. Application. The commissioner shall accept applications from owners of eligible lands
at the time, in the form, and containing the information as the commissioner may prescribe. If
the number of applications exceeds the ability to fund them all, priority shall be given to those
applications covering lands providing the greatest public benefits for timber productivity, public
access, and ecological and wildlife values.
    Subd. 7. Landowner responsibilities. The commissioner may enroll eligible land in the program
by signing an easement in recordable form with a landowner in which the landowner agrees to:
   (1) convey to the state a permanent easement that is not subject to any prior title, lien, or
encumbrance; and
    (2) manage the land in a manner consistent with the purposes for which the land was selected
for the program and not convert the land to other uses.
   Subd. 8. Advisory team. In administering the program, the commissioner may establish an
advisory team to provide advice on program management.
    Subd. 9. Correction of easement boundary lines. To correct errors in legal descriptions for
easements that affect the ownership interests in the state and adjacent landowners, the commissioner
may, in the name of the state, convey without consideration, interests of the state necessary to correct
legal descriptions of boundaries. The conveyance must be by quitclaim deed or release in a form
approved by the attorney general.
    Subd. 10. Terminating or changing an easement. The commissioner may terminate an
easement, with the consent of the property owner, if the commissioner determines termination to be
in the public interest. The commissioner may modify the terms of an easement if the commissioner
determines that modification will help implement the Minnesota forests for the future program or
facilitate the program's administration.
   Subd. 11. Payments. Payments to landowners under the Minnesota forests for the future program
shall be made in accordance with law and Department of Natural Resources acquisition policies,
procedures, and other funding requirements.
   Subd. 12. Monitoring, enforcement, and damages. (a) The commissioner shall establish a
long-term program for monitoring and enforcing Minnesota forests for the future easements.
    (b) A landowner who violates the terms of an easement under this section or induces, assists, or
allows another to do so is liable to the state for damages due to the loss of timber, scenic, recreational,
fish and wildlife habitat, threatened and endangered species, and other cultural and environmental
values.
    (c) Upon request of the commissioner, the attorney general may commence an action for specific
performance, injunctive relief, damages, including attorney's fees, and any other appropriate relief
to enforce this section in district court in the county where all or part of the violation is alleged to

road centerlines and that has been duly recorded with the county recorder is an adequate description
for purposes of recording road easements and the map is the legally constituted description and
prevails when a deed for a parcel abutting a road contains no reference to a road easement. Nothing
prevents the commissioner from accepting a more definitive metes and bounds or survey description
of a road easement for a road of record if the description of the easement is referenced to equal
distance on both sides of the existing road centerline.
   (f) The commissioner shall consult with representatives of county land commissioners, county
auditors, county recorders, and Torrens examiners in implementing this subdivision.

designation and only for those portions of the map designation that directly affect them.
    (b) A property owner may appeal the map designation to the commissioner within 60 days of
the map being recorded by filing a written request for review. The commissioner shall review the
request and any supporting evidence and render a decision within 45 days of receipt of the request
for review.
   (c) If a property owner wishes to appeal a decision of the commissioner after review under
paragraph (b), the property owner must file an appeal with the district court within 60 days of the
commissioner's decision.
   (d) If any portion of a map appealed under paragraph (b) is modified or found to be invalid by a

wildlife feeding under this paragraph may not obtain a hunting license to take a wild animal for two
years after the date of conviction.
    (c) The commissioner may prevent or control wildlife disease in a species of wild animal in the
state by emergency rule adopted under section 84.027, subdivision 13.
    (d) If the commissioner determines that a disease in wildlife in this state presents a substantial
and imminent threat to the state's wildlife or to livestock or human health, the commissioner may
declare an emergency under this section for purposes of establishing wildlife disease management
zones to prevent the spread of disease and carry out the functions of this section. In an established
wildlife disease management zone, the following restrictions on wildlife feeding activities are in
effect:
    (1) except as provided in clauses (2) and (3), a person may not place or distribute feed in an area
frequented by deer or elk or knowingly allow another person to place or distribute feed on property
under the person's ownership or lease. For purposes of this paragraph, "feed" means grains, fruits,
vegetables, nuts, hay, or other food that is capable of attracting or enticing deer or elk. Liquid scents
are not feed;
    (2) unless otherwise prescribed by the commissioner, wildlife feeding is allowed if the feed is
placed in such a manner as to exclude access to deer and elk or the feed is placed at least six feet
above the ground; and
    (3) the prohibition in clause (1) does not apply to feed that is present solely as a result of normal
agriculture, forest management, or wildlife feed planting practices. It also does not apply to feed
that is for agricultural or livestock purposes if the feed is:
   (i) placed for domestic livestock that are present and actively consuming the feed on a daily
basis;
    (ii) covered to deter deer or elk from gaining access to the feed; or
    (iii) stored consistently with normal agricultural practices.

located and furnish them a description of the land to be acquired. The county board must approve
or disapprove the proposed acquisition within 90 days after being notified. The commissioner may
extend the time up to 30 days. The soil and water conservation district supervisors shall counsel the
county board on drainage and flood control and the best utilization and capability of the land.
  (c) If the county board approves the acquisition within the prescribed time, the commissioner
may acquire the land.
    (d) If the county board disapproves the acquisition, it must state valid reasons. The commissioner
may not purchase or lease the land if the county board disapproves the acquisition and states its
reasons within the prescribed time period. The landowner or the commissioner may appeal the
disapproval to the district court having jurisdiction where the land is located.
    (e) The commissioner or the owner of the land may submit the proposed acquisition to the
Land Exchange Board if: (1) the county board does not give reason for disapproval, or does not
approve or disapprove the acquisition within the prescribed time period; or (2) the court finds that
the disapproval is arbitrary and capricious, or that the reasons stated for disapproval are invalid.
    (f) The Land Exchange Board must conduct a hearing and make a decision on the acquisition
within 60 days after receiving the proposal. The Land Exchange Board must give notice of the
hearing to the county board, the commissioner, the landowner, and other interested parties. The
Land Exchange Board must consider the interests of the county, the state, and the landowner in
determining whether the acquisition is in the public interest. If a majority of the Land Exchange
Board members approves the acquisition, the commissioner may acquire the land. If a majority
disapproves, the commissioner may not purchase or lease the land.
   (g) This subdivision does not apply to land acquired for the Carlos Avery and Lamprey Pass

    (2) the licensee is unable to participate in the licensed activity because the licensee is called
to active military duty or military leave is canceled during the entire open season of the licensed
activity. The original license and a copy of the military orders or notice of cancellation of leave must

read:
     Subd. 2. Personal possession. (a) A person acting under a license or traveling from an area where
a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp
validation and a valid state driver's license, state identification card, or other form of identification
provided by the commissioner, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but
the actual license has not been issued and received. A person charged with violating the license
possession requirement shall not be convicted if the person produces in court or the office of the
arresting officer, the actual license previously issued to that person, which was valid at the time
of arrest, or satisfactory proof that at the time of the arrest the person was validly licensed. Upon
request of a conservation officer or peace officer, a licensee shall write the licensee's name in the
presence of the officer to determine the identity of the licensee.
    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.
    (d) A license issued electronically and not immediately provided to the licensee shall be mailed

that is unable to hunt or take rough fish by archery because of a permanent or temporary physical
disability. A crossbow permit issued under this section also allows the permittee to use a bow with a

   Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97C.203, is amended to read:
  97C.203 EXCHANGE OF FISH OR WILDLIFE RESOURCES; DISPOSAL OF STATE
HATCHERY PRODUCTS.
    (a) The commissioner shall dispose of fish hatchery products or exchange fish or wildlife
resources only after they have been tested for certifiable diseases. The testing must have been
completed within the 12 months preceding the disposal or exchange. Fish or wildlife resources
subject to an exchange must have received a disease-free certification for those certifiable diseases
not currently documented in Minnesota. Disease certification must be provided prior to accepting
the fish or wildlife resource. When the fish or wildlife resource is not certified as disease-free, they
may be stocked or transferred only into waters that already contain that disease.
   (b) State hatchery products shall be disposed of according to the following order of priorities:
   (1) distribution of fish eggs and fry to state hatcheries to hatch fry or raise fingerlings for stocking
waters of the state for recreational fishing;
    (2) transfer to other government agencies in exchange for fish or wildlife resources of equal value
or private fish hatcheries in exchange for fish to be stocked in waters of the state for recreational
fishing;
   (3) sale to private fish hatcheries or licensed aquatic farms at a price not less than the fair
wholesale market value, established as the average price charged at the state's private hatcheries
and contiguous states per volume rates;
  (4) transfer to other government agencies, colleges, or universities for cooperative fish
management and research purposes; and
    (5) sale of not more than $25 fair market value to any school, museum, or commercial enterprise
for curriculum implementation, educational programs, public exhibition, or cooperative displays.
   Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97C.205, is amended to read:
   97C.205 TRANSPORTING AND STOCKING FISH.
   (a) Except on the water body where taken, a person may not transport a live fish in a quantity of
water sufficient to keep the fish alive, unless the fish:
   (1) is being transported under an aquaculture license as authorized under sections 17.4985 and
17.4986;
   (2) is being transported for a fishing contest weigh-in under section 97C.081;
   (3) is a minnow being transported under section 97C.505 or 97C.515;
   (4) is being transported by a commercial fishing license holder under section 97C.821; or
    (5) is being transported as otherwise authorized in this section or as prescribed for certifiable
diseases under sections 17.46 to 17.4999.
   (b) The commissioner may adopt rules to allow and regulate:
   (1) the transportation of fish and fish eggs; and

   (2) the stocking of waters with fish or fish eggs.
    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe rules designed to encourage local sporting organizations
to propagate game fish by using rearing ponds. The rules must:
   (1) prescribe methods to acquire brood stock for the ponds by seining public waters;
   (2) allow the sporting organizations to own and use seines and other necessary equipment; and
   (3) prescribe methods for stocking the fish in public waters that give priority to the needs of the
community where the fish are reared and the desires of the organization operating the rearing pond.
    (d) A person age 16 or under may, for purposes of display in a home aquarium, transport
largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rock bass, black crappie, white crappie, bluegill
pumpkinseed, green sunfish, orange spotted sunfish, and black, yellow, and brown bullheads
taken by angling. No more than four of each species may be transported at any one time, and any
individual fish can be no longer than ten inches in total length.
   Sec. 61. [97C.303] CONSERVATION ANGLING LICENSE.
    Subdivision 1. Availability. The commissioner shall make available a conservation angling
license according to this section. Conservation angling licenses shall be offered for resident
and nonresident individuals, resident married couples, nonresident married couples valid for 14
consecutive days, and nonresident families.
    Subd. 2. Daily and possession limits. Daily and possession limits for fish taken under a
conservation angling license are one-half the daily and possession limits for the corresponding fish
taken under a standard angling license, rounded down to the next whole number if necessary.
    Subd. 3. License fee. The fee for a conservation angling license issued under this section is
two-thirds of the corresponding standard angling license fee under section 97A.475, subdivision 6
or 7, rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

land to be appraised, utilize the valuation process provided under section 84.0272, subdivision 3,
or obtain a market analysis from a qualified real estate broker. Merchantable timber value must be
determined and considered in finalizing valuation of the lands.
     (b) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
utilize title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. All expedited land exchanges under this
section, and the terms and conditions of the exchanges, require the unanimous approval of the
Land Exchange Board.

executed by the commissioner of natural resources in the name of the state. Conveyance of Class
2 land given in exchange shall be by a deed executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name
of the state. Conveyance of Class 3 land shall be by a deed executed by the governing body in the
name of the governing authority.

shall first be delivered to the commissioner of natural resources. Following the recording of the
deed, the commissioner of natural resources shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 1 land.

reverter that provides that title to the land automatically reverts to the conveying governmental unit
if:
   (1) the receiving governmental unit sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers title of the land
within 40 years of the date of the deed conveying ownership; and
   (2) there is no prior written approval for the transfer from the conveying governmental unit. The
authority for granting approval is the commissioner of natural resources for former Class 1 land, the
county board for former Class 2 land, and the governing body for former Class 3 land.
    (b) Class 1 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section 94.343,
subdivision 4. Class 2 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section
94.344, subdivision 4. County fee land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of
section 373.01, subdivision 1, paragraph (g).
    Subd. 8. Land status. Land received in exchange for Class 1 land is subject to the same trust,
if any, and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange
for Class 2 land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision wherein it lies and all
laws relating to tax-forfeited land. Land received in exchange for Class 3 land has the same status
as the land given in exchange.

section. A petition may seek a certificate for a single crime or multiple crimes. When filing the
petition, the person shall pay a filing fee in the amount required under section 357.021, subdivision
2, clause (1).
    (b) A person is not eligible for a certificate of good conduct and may not file a petition under
this section if the person has filed a petition for a certificate of good conduct or expungement in the
past two years.
   Subd. 2. Contents of petition. (a) A petition for a certificate of good conduct must be signed
under oath by the petitioner and state the following:
   (1) the petitioner's full name and all other legal names or aliases by which the petitioner has been
known at any time;
   (2) the petitioner's date of birth;
    (3) all of the petitioner's addresses from the date of the offense in connection with which a
certificate is sought, to the date of the petition;
   (4) why the certificate is sought and why it should be granted;
    (5) the details of the offense for which the certificate is sought, including the date and jurisdiction
of the offense; either the names of any victims or that there were no identifiable victims; whether
there is a current order for protection, restraining order, or other no contact order prohibiting the
petitioner from contacting the victims or whether there has ever been a prior order for protection or
restraining order prohibiting the petitioner from contacting the victims; the court file number; and
the date of conviction;
    (6) what steps the petitioner has taken since the time of the offense toward personal rehabilitation,
including treatment, work, or other personal history that demonstrates rehabilitation;
    (7) the petitioner's criminal conviction record indicating all convictions for misdemeanors, gross
misdemeanors, or felonies in this state, and for all comparable convictions in any other state, federal
court, or foreign country, whether the convictions occurred before or after the conviction for which
the certificate is sought;

petition for a certificate of good conduct and a proposed certificate order on the prosecutorial office
that had jurisdiction over the offense for which the certificate is sought.
    (b) The prosecutorial office that had jurisdiction over the offense for which the certificate is
sought shall serve by mail the petition for the certificate and the proposed certificate order on any
victims of the offense for which the certificate is sought who have requested notice pursuant to
section 611A.06. Service under this paragraph does not constitute a violation of an existing order
for protection, restraining order, or other no contact order.
    (c) The prosecutorial office's notice to victims of the offense under this subdivision must
specifically inform the victims of the victims' right to be present and to submit an oral or written
statement at the hearing described in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 4. Hearing. If the petition is filed in the judicial district where the offender was sentenced,
the sentencing judge should preside over the hearing when possible. A victim of the offense for
which a certificate is sought has a right to submit an oral or written statement to the court at the
time of the hearing describing any conduct of the offender that has occurred after the offender's
sentencing that is relevant to the issue of whether the offender has been rehabilitated, including the
effect of this conduct upon the victim. The judge shall consider the victim's statement when making
a decision.
    Subd. 5. Eligibility. A person is eligible for a certificate of good conduct under this section if
the following conditions are met:
   (1) the person has been successfully discharged from the sentence imposed for the offense for
which the certificate is sought and is not under correctional supervision for any other offense;
   (2) the person is not currently required to register as a predatory offender under section 243.166;
    (3) the person has been law abiding for the following period immediately preceding the filing of
the petition: (i) for a person convicted of a crime against the person or who was required to register
as a predatory offender, five years; or (ii) for all other persons, three years;
    (4) the person demonstrates rehabilitation, which may be shown, among other ways, by evidence
of the person's good character, employment, volunteer activities, or participation in vocational,
educational, treatment, or rehabilitation programs;
    (5) the person has paid or the court determines the person is making a good faith and consistent
effort to pay court-ordered fines, restitution, and other costs related to the crime for which the
certificate is sought;
    (6) for petitions for certificates for crimes where an element of the offense involved alcohol or
a controlled substance, that the person is not abusing alcohol or using a controlled substance;
   (7) the issuance of the certificate is consistent with the public interest; and
    (8) any other factor deemed relevant by the court, including, but not limited to, the severity of
the conduct that constituted the offense for which the certificate is sought.
    Subd. 6. Issuance of certificate. A judge shall issue a certificate of good conduct to a petitioner if
the petitioner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner meets the eligibility
requirements specified in subdivisions 1, paragraph (b); 5, clauses (1) to (7); and any other factor
9112                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [109TH DAY

required by the court under subdivision 5, clause (8).
    Subd. 7. Record with Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. After ruling on a petition under this
section, the court shall notify the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension of the court's ruling. The bureau
shall record the court's ruling on the petitioner's criminal record.
    Subd. 8. Effect of certificate. (a) A certificate of good conduct issued under this section creates
a presumption of rehabilitation in favor of the person to whom it was issued and relieves the person
of any state-imposed collateral sanction, as defined in section 609B.050, relating to eligibility for
housing, employment, or professional or occupational licensing arising from a crime for which the
certificate was issued. For background studies under chapter 245C, the commissioner of human
services may not disqualify any individual solely for a crime for which the individual has received
a certificate of good conduct. When an individual obtains a certificate of good conduct for a crime
for which the commissioner of human services had previously disqualified the individual, upon
presentation of the certificate of good conduct by the individual, the commissioner shall rescind the
relevant disqualification.
   (b) A certificate of good conduct has no effect on collateral sanctions that are unrelated to
housing, employment, or licensing.
    (c) Consistent with paragraph (a) and other applicable law, a housing or licensing authority or
employer may, but is not required to, take into account a conviction that is the subject of a certificate
of good conduct when making a housing, licensing, or hiring decision.
    (d) A housing or licensing authority or employer is not civilly or criminally liable for relying
on a certificate of good conduct when offering housing, employment, or licensing to a person. This
paragraph does not relieve a person from any other legal duty in making a housing, employment, or
licensing decision not related to the conduct that is the subject of the certificate of good conduct.
   (e) Evidence relating to a conviction for which a certificate of good conduct has been issued is
inadmissible in a civil action against a housing or licensing authority or employer for negligence or
other fault in renting, leasing, licensing, or hiring if the authority or employer relied on the certificate
when making the underlying decision.
    (f) The existence of a certificate of good conduct is admissible as evidence of reasonable care by
a person who relied on it when making a housing, licensing, or hiring decision related to the subject
of the certificate.
    Subd. 9. Revocation. A certificate of good conduct is revoked by operation of law if the subject
of the certificate is subsequently convicted or adjudicated delinquent for a new crime.
    Subd. 10. Limited effect. A certificate of good conduct has only the effect given in this section.
A certificate does not act as a pardon or expungement. The certificate does not relieve the person
to whom it was issued of any collateral sanctions or legal disabilities related to predatory offender
registration, eligibility to possess firearms, or driver's license sanctions.
    Subd. 11. Crime for misuse. Unless a greater penalty is specified elsewhere in statute, a person
who knowingly uses or attempts to use a revoked certificate of good conduct or who fraudulently
alters or forges a certificate of good conduct is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008.
109TH DAY]                        WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2008                                         9113

  Sec. 6. [364.20] USE OF NONCONVICTION RECORDS BY PRIVATE EMPLOYERS;
IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL LIABILITY.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
   (1) "conviction" has the meaning given in section 609.02, subdivision 5;
    (2) "nonconviction criminal record" means a record of an arrest, citation, complaint, prosecution,
or other record relating to a criminal proceeding that is not pending and did not result in a conviction;
stayed sentence under section 152.18, subdivision 1; or referral to a diversion program; and
    (3) "private employer" means a person hiring or employing individuals in this state, but does not
include the state or a political subdivision of the state governed by sections 364.01 to 364.10.
   Subd. 2. Use of nonconviction records for private employment. Unless a criminal background
investigation is specifically required or permitted by law, a private employer must not:
   (1) request information regarding a nonconviction criminal record from an employee or
prospective employee or obtain access to a nonconviction criminal record from another source; or
    (2) take adverse action against an employee or prospective employee based on a nonconviction
criminal record.
    Subd. 3. Affirmative defense. (a) To the extent a criminal record as of the date an individual
was hired is alleged as the basis for negligent hiring, a private employer shall not be held liable for
the hiring of the individual if the employer establishes that they followed the provisions applicable
to public employers in section 364.03 and reasonably determined that:
   (1) the conviction did not directly relate to the position of employment being sought; or
    (2) the individual showed evidence of sufficient rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the
duties of the employment being sought.
    (b) This subdivision does not create any duty on the part of an employer to follow the provisions
of paragraph (a).
     Subd. 4. Remedy. A private employer who violates subdivision 2 is liable to the individual who
is the subject of the criminal record for $1,000 or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever
is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 15A.0815, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Appointing authorities to recommend certain salaries. (a) The governor, or
other appropriate appointing authority, may submit to the Legislative Coordinating Commission
recommendations for salaries within the salary limits for the positions listed in subdivisions 2 to 4.
An appointing authority may also propose additions or deletions of positions from those listed.
   (b) Before submitting the recommendations, the appointing authority shall consult with the
commissioner of employee relations concerning the recommendations.
    (c) In making recommendations, the appointing authority shall consider the criteria established
in section 43A.18, subdivision 8, and the performance of individual incumbents. The performance
evaluation must include a review of an incumbent's progress toward attainment of affirmative action
goals. The appointing authority shall establish an objective system for quantifying knowledge,
abilities, duties, responsibilities, and accountabilities, and in determining recommendations, rate
each position by this system.
    (d) Before the appointing authority's recommended salaries take effect, the recommendations
must be reviewed and approved, rejected, or modified by the Legislative Coordinating Commission
and the legislature under section 3.855, subdivisions 2 and 3. If, when the legislature is not in session,
the commission fails to reject or modify salary recommendations of the governor within 30 calendar
days of their receipt, the recommendations are deemed to be approved.
    (e) The appointing authority shall set the initial salary of a head of a new agency or a chair of
a new metropolitan board or commission whose salary is not specifically prescribed by law after
consultation with the commissioner, whose recommendation is advisory only. The amount of the
new salary must be comparable to the salary of an agency head or commission chair having similar
duties and responsibilities.

                                    4, may be increased or decreased by the appointing authority from
the salary previously set for that position within 30 days of the new appointment after consultation
with the commissioner. If the appointing authority increases a salary under this paragraph, the
appointing authority shall submit the new salary to the Legislative Coordinating Commission and
the full legislature for approval, modification, or rejection under section 3.855, subdivisions 2
and 3. If, when the legislature is not in session, the commission fails to reject or modify salary
recommendations of the governor within 30 calendar days of their receipt, the recommendations
are deemed to be approved.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Budget format. In each even-numbered calendar year the commissioner shall
prepare budget forms and instructions for all agencies, including guidelines for reporting agency
performance measures, subject to the approval of the governor. In addition to the review required
under subdivision 1c, the commissioner shall request and receive advisory recommendations
from the chairs of the senate Finance Committee and house of representatives Ways and
Means Committee before adopting a format for the biennial budget document. By June 15, the
commissioner shall send the proposed budget forms to the appropriations and finance committees.
The committees have until July 15 to give the commissioner their advisory recommendations on
possible improvements. To facilitate this consultation, the commissioner shall establish a working
group consisting of executive branch staff and designees of the chairs of the senate Finance and
house of representatives Ways and Means Committees. The commissioner must involve this group
in all stages of development of budget forms and instructions. The budget format must show actual
expenditures and receipts for the most recent fiscal year, estimated expenditures and receipts for the
current fiscal year, and estimates for each fiscal year of the next biennium. Estimated expenditures
must be classified by funds and character of expenditures and may be subclassified by programs
and activities. Agency revenue estimates must show how the estimates were made and what factors
were used. Receipts must be classified by funds, programs, and activities. Expenditure and revenue
estimates must be based on the law in existence at the time the estimates are prepared.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.10, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Performance measures for change items. For each change item in the budget
proposal requesting new or increased funding, the budget document must present proposed
performance measures that can be used to determine if the new or increased funding is
accomplishing its goals. To the extent possible, each budget change item must identify relevant
Minnesota Milestones and other statewide goals and indicators related to the proposed initiative.
By June 15 of each even-numbered year, the commissioner must report to the Subcommittee on
Government Accountability established under section 3.885, subdivision 11, regarding the format
and process to be used for the presentation and selection of Minnesota Milestones and other
statewide goals and indicators. By July 15 of each even-numbered year, the subcommittee must
recommend the format and process for use in the preparation of the budget documents.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

be made by an appraiser that holds a state appraiser license issued by the Department of Commerce.
The appraisal must be in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice
of the Appraisal Foundation.
    (c) Before offering surplus state-owned lands for public sale, the lands shall first be offered to
the city, county, town, school district, or other public body corporate or politic in which the lands
are situated for public purposes and the lands may be sold for public purposes for not less than the
appraised value of the lands. To determine whether a public body desires to purchase the surplus
land, the commissioner shall give a written notice to the governing body of each political subdivision
whose jurisdictional boundaries include or are adjacent to the surplus land. If a public body desires
to purchase the surplus land, it shall submit a written offer to the commissioner no later than two
weeks after receipt of notice setting forth in detail its reasons for desiring to acquire and its intended
use of the land. In the event that more than one public body tenders an offer, the commissioner
shall determine which party shall receive the property and shall submit written findings regarding
the decision. If lands are offered for sale for public purposes and if a public body notifies the
commissioner of its desire to acquire the lands, the public body may have up to two years from
the date of the accepted offer to commence payment for the lands in the manner provided by law.

saleable, including survey, appraisal, legal, advertising, and other expenses.
    (c) Parcels remaining unsold after the offering may be sold to anyone agreeing to pay the
appraised value. The sale shall continue until all parcels are sold or until the commissioner orders
a reappraisal or withdraws the remaining parcels from sale.

The purchaser must pay at the time of sale ten percent of the total amount bid and the remainder of
the payment is due within 90 days of the sale date. A person who fails to make final payment within
90 days of the sale date is in default. On default, all right, title, and interest of the purchaser or heirs,
representatives, or assigns of the purchaser in the premises shall terminate without the state doing
any act or thing. A record of the default must be made in the state land records of the commissioner.

relationship to other positions in the executive branch. A recognized system for classification
analysis and its concurrent point allocation system must be used in order to attain compensation
equity. Classification range maximums must fall within the system's point allocation window.
Market-driven forces are recognized as acceptable in order to maintain employee recruitment
and retention efforts whenever the compensation rates exceed the allocated points. No contract
executed under chapter 179A may modify, waive, or abridge this section and sections 43A.07 to
43A.121, 43A.15, and 43A.17 to 43A.21, except to the extent expressly permitted in those sections.

                                        ­ Compensation limit. (a) The salary and the value of all other
forms of compensation of the positions in section 15A.0815 and a person employed by a political
subdivision of this state, excluding a school district, or employed under section 422A.03 may not
exceed 110 percent of the salary of the governor as set under section 15A.082, except as provided
in this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, "political subdivision of this state" includes a
statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, metropolitan or regional agency, or other political
subdivision, but does not include a hospital, clinic, or health maintenance organization owned by
such a governmental unit.
    (b) Beginning in 2006, the limit in paragraph (a) shall be adjusted annually in January. The
limit shall equal the limit for the prior year increased by the percentage increase, if any, in the
Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second prior year to October of
the immediately prior year.
    (c) Deferred compensation and payroll allocations to purchase an individual annuity contract
for an employee are included in determining the employee's salary. Other forms of compensation
which shall be included to determine an employee's total compensation are all other direct and
indirect items of compensation which are not specifically excluded by this subdivision. Other forms
of compensation which shall not be included in a determination of an employee's total compensation
for the purposes of this subdivision are:
    (1) employee benefits that are also provided for the majority of all other full-time employees of
the political subdivision, vacation and sick leave allowances, health and dental insurance, disability
insurance, term life insurance, and pension benefits or like benefits the cost of which is borne by the
employee or which is not subject to tax as income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
   (2) dues paid to organizations that are of a civic, professional, educational, or governmental
nature; and
    (3) reimbursement for actual expenses incurred by the employee which the governing body
determines to be directly related to the performance of job responsibilities, including any relocation
expenses paid during the initial year of employment.
    The value of other forms of compensation shall be the annual cost to the political subdivision
for the provision of the compensation.

body of the political subdivision has determined requires an M.D. or D.O. degree is excluded from
the limitation in this subdivision.
    (e) The commissioner may increase the limitation in this subdivision for a position that the
commissioner has determined requires special expertise necessitating a higher salary to attract
or retain a qualified person. The commissioner shall review each proposed increase giving due
consideration to salary rates paid to other persons with similar responsibilities in the state and
nation. The commissioner may not increase the limitation until the commissioner has presented
the proposed increase to the Legislative Coordinating Commission and received the commission's
recommendation on it. The recommendation is advisory only. If the commission does not give
its recommendation on a proposed increase within 30 days from its receipt of the proposal, the
commission is deemed to have made no recommendation. If the commissioner grants or granted
an increase under this paragraph, the new limitation shall be adjusted beginning in August 2005
and in each subsequent calendar year in January by the percentage increase equal to the percentage
increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second
prior year to October of the immediately prior year.
   Sec. 18. [43A.187] BLOOD DONATION LEAVE.
    A state employee must be granted leave from work with 100 percent of pay to donate blood
at a location away from the place of work. The total amount of leave used under this paragraph
may not exceed three hours in a 12-month period, and must be determined by the employee. A state
employee seeking leave from work under this section must provide 14 days' notice to the appointing
authority. This leave must not affect the employee's vacation leave, pension, compensatory time,
personal vacation days, sick leave, earned overtime accumulation, or cause a loss of seniority. For
the purposes of this section, "state employee" does not include an employee of the Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities.

    Subd. 2. Administrative issues. (a) The commissioner may select the administrator. The
administrator must have at least five years of experience working as a power systems engineer
or transmission planner, or in a position dealing with power system reliability issues, and may
not have been a party or a participant in a commission energy proceeding for at least one year
prior to selection by the commissioner. The commissioner shall oversee and direct the work of the
administrator, annually review the expenses of the administrator, and annually approve the budget
of the administrator. The administrator may hire staff and may contract for technical expertise in

   (c) The Department of Commerce shall pay:
    (1) the general administrative costs of the administrator, not to exceed $1,000,000 in a fiscal
year, and shall assess energy utilities for those administrative costs. These costs must be consistent
with the budget approved by the commissioner under paragraph (a). The department shall apportion
the costs among all energy utilities in proportion to their respective gross operating revenues from
sales of gas or electric service within the state during the last calendar year, and shall then render a
bill to each utility on a regular basis; and
    (2) costs relating to a specific proceeding analysis or project and shall render a bill to the specific
energy utility or utilities participating in the proceeding, analysis, or project directly, either at the
conclusion of a particular proceeding, analysis, or project, or from time to time during the course of
the proceeding, analysis, or project.
    (d) For purposes of administrative efficiency, the department shall assess energy utilities and
issue bills in accordance with the billing and assessment procedures provided in section 216B.62,
to the extent that these procedures do not conflict with this subdivision. The amount of the bills
rendered by the department under paragraph (c) must be paid by the energy utility into an account
in the special revenue fund in the state treasury within 30 days from the date of billing and is
appropriated to the department for the purposes provided in this section. The commission shall
approve or approve as modified a rate schedule providing for the automatic adjustment of charges

accepted accounting principles so as to make a full disclosure of the following, including necessary
allocations between each item and the basis of such allocations:
   (a) total receipts and total income from all sources;
   (b) cost of management and general;
   (c) program services;
   (d) cost of fund-raising;
   (e) cost of public education;

related organizations, as that term is defined by section 317A.011, subdivision 18, that receive
total compensation of more than $50,000, together with the total compensation paid to each. Total
compensation shall include salaries, fees, bonuses, fringe benefits, severance payments, and deferred
compensation paid by the charitable organization and all related organizations as that term is defined
by section 317A.011, subdivision 18.
   Unless otherwise required by this subdivision, the financial statement need not be certified.
    A financial statement of a charitable organization which has received total revenue in excess
of $350,000 for the 12 months of operation covered by the statement shall be accompanied by an
audited financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
that has been examined by an independent certified public accountant for the purpose of expressing
an opinion. In preparing the audit the certified public accountant shall take into consideration capital,
endowment or other reserve funds, if any, controlled by the charitable organization. For purposes of
calculating the $350,000 total revenue threshold provided by this subdivision, the value of donated
food to a nonprofit food shelf may not be included if the food is donated for subsequent distribution
at no charge, and not for resale.

    Subd. 5. Advisory board meetings. (a) If compliance with section 13D.02 is impractical, the
Small Business Development Center Advisory Board, created pursuant to United States Code, title
15, section 648, may conduct a meeting of its members by telephone or other electronic means so
long as the following conditions are met:
   (1) all members of the board participating in the meeting, wherever their physical location, can
hear one another and can hear all discussion and testimony;
    (2) members of the public present at the regular meeting location of the board can hear clearly
all discussion and testimony and all votes of members of the board and, if needed, receive those
services required by sections 15.44 and 15.441;
     (3) at least one member of the board is physically present at the regular meeting location; and
   (4) all votes are conducted by roll call, so each member's vote on each issue can be identified
and recorded.
    (b) Each member of the board participating in a meeting by telephone or other electronic means
is considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum and participating in all
proceedings.
    (c) If telephone or other electronic means is used to conduct a meeting, the board, to the extent
practical, shall allow a person to monitor the meeting electronically from a remote location. The
board may require the person making such a connection to pay for documented marginal costs that
the board incurs as a result of the additional connection.
    (d) If telephone or other electronic means is used to conduct a regular, special, or emergency
meeting, the board shall provide notice of the regular meeting location, of the fact that some
members may participate by telephone or other electronic means, and of the provisions of paragraph

   Page 78, after line 15, insert:
                                           "ARTICLE 4
                            GOALS OF HEALTH CARE REFORM
   Section 1. POLICY GOALS OF HEALTH CARE REFORM.
    It is the policy and intent of the state of Minnesota to enact and promote consumer-driven,
market-based solutions within the health care sector, to achieve the greatest access to the highest
quality of care. It is not the intent of this act to shift, in part or in whole, any care provided in
the private market to public programs or to a single-payer government-managed system. Any
policies enacted must be patient-centered, and offer choice and competition through the free
market. Any policies enacted must inform and empower consumer decision-making, prevent health
care rationing, provide effective accountability, and advance and provide access to high-quality,
affordable care.
                                            ARTICLE 5
                                     INSURANCE REFORM
   Section 1. [43A.221] BENEFIT STRUCTURE; HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.
   (a) The state employee group insurance plan must be structured as a high-deductible health
plan that would allow both the employer and participants to qualify under federal law to use health
savings accounts to:
   (1) provide open access to health care services and unlimited patient choice;
   (2) save on health care costs by encouraging price comparison shopping; and
   (3) create a tax-free, interest-earning fund for future medical expenses.
    (b) The plan must include an option for the employer to contribute at least 60 percent of the cost
of the chosen high-deductible health plan and a maximum of 100 percent of the chosen deductible
for both single and family coverage per year. Preventive care coverage must be 100 percent covered
by the insurance portion of the plan with a waiver of the deductible.
    (c) The goal of the employer is to expand coverage through the health savings account for eligible
items, including but not limited to:
   (1) all preventive and medical care services;
   (2) eyeglasses, contact lenses, and laser eye surgery;
   (3) preventive and restorative dental procedures, including orthodontics;
   (4) all over-the-counter medications and supplies;
   (5) future long-term care policy premiums; and
   (6) future Medicare Part B premiums.

    (d) The goal of the employer is to enable a dramatic reduction in potential out-of-pocket financial
liability to the employee with both single and family coverage as compared to the present plan.
    (e) The goal of the employer is to eliminate the employee's net out-of-pocket plan liability
through the tax-free accumulation of both employee elective pretax payroll contributions, and the
accumulation of unused health savings account funds from year to year.
   (f) It is the employer's goal to allow for the portability of employee-owned pretax health savings
account accumulations into retirement for the purpose of financing health care needs of the retired
employee postretirement on a tax-free basis.
    (g) Any future premium reductions of the high-deductible health plan shall be reinvested back
into employee health savings accounts as a reward for successful efforts in achieving the goals of
this new plan.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the insurance plan year beginning January 1,
2010.
   Sec. 2. [62J.261] HEALTH COVERAGE MANDATE COST INFORMATION.
    The commissioner of commerce shall post, and update at least annually, on the Department of
Commerce Web site information for consumers regarding health coverage mandates required under
Minnesota law. The information must list separately each current mandate and an estimate of its cost
as a percentage of the premium, if available. The estimated cost must be based on the assumption
that the benefit would not be covered in the absence of a mandate. A health plan company shall,
upon request of the commissioner, provide information it has, if any, regarding the estimated cost
of a mandate based upon the health plan company's experience. Cost estimates posted on the Web
site may be an average or may specify a range of costs, but must not identify particular health plan
companies.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.2930, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Virtual health pretax benefits exchange. The commissioner shall create a Web site to
assist employers and employees in obtaining health benefits on a pretax basis. The Web site must
focus on providing a cost-effective means of connecting employers and employees with providers
of pretax health benefit plans. The Web site must also focus on educating employees and employers
on the tax advantage of pretax health benefits.
   Sec. 4. [62Q.022] HEALTH PLAN COMPANIES AUTHORIZED IN OTHER STATES.
   (a) Health plan companies authorized to issue health coverage in other states may issue health
coverage in this state under this section.
   (b) Out-of-state health plan companies authorized under this section are not required to provide
benefits mandated under the laws of this state in coverage sold to residents of this state.
    (c) Each written application for participation in an out-of-state health benefit plan shall contain
the following language in boldface type at the beginning of the document: "This policy is primarily
governed by the laws of [insert state where the master policy is filed]; therefore, all of the rating
laws applicable to policies filed in this state do not apply to this policy, which may result in
increases in your premium at renewal that would not be permissible in a Minnesota-approved

policy. Any purchase of individual health insurance should be considered carefully since future
medical conditions may make it impossible to qualify for another individual health policy. For
information concerning individual health coverage under a Minnesota-approved policy, please
consult your insurance agent or the Minnesota Department of Commerce or Minnesota Department
of Health."
    (d) Each out-of-state health benefit plan shall contain the following language in boldface type at
the beginning of the document: "The benefits of this policy providing your coverage are governed
primarily by the laws of a state other than Minnesota. While this health benefit plan may provide
you a more affordable health insurance policy, it may also provide fewer health benefits than those
included as state mandated health benefits in policies in Minnesota. Please consult your insurance
agent to determine which state-mandated health benefits are excluded under this policy."
    (e) The commissioner of commerce or health, as appropriate, shall be authorized to conduct
market conduct and solvency examinations of all out-of-state companies seeking to offer health
benefit plans in this state or who have been given approval to offer health benefit plans in this state.
Such examinations shall be conducted in the same manner and under the same terms and conditions
as for companies located in this state.
    (f) The commissioners of commerce and health shall adopt rules necessary to implement this
chapter, including, but not limited to, determining which health plan companies located in other
states shall be authorized to offer plans to Minnesota residents and determining the manner of
approving the health benefit plans offered by such companies.
  Sec. 5. [604.111] EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE AND OB/GYN ACTIONS; LIMITS ON

(d) have the meanings given them.
    (b) "Economic loss" means all harm for which damages are recoverable, other than noneconomic

that health care provider also includes a physician assistant registered under chapter 147A and
ambulance services, medical directors, and personnel regulated under chapter 144E.
    (d) "Noneconomic loss" means all nonpecuniary harm for which damages are recoverable,
including, but not limited to, pain, disability, disfigurement, embarrassment, emotional distress,
and loss of consortium.
    Subd. 2. Limitation. (a) In an action for injury or death against a health care provider alleging
malpractice, error, mistake, or failure to cure, whether based in contract or tort, in which the health
care services at issue were provided for:
   (1) pregnancy or labor and delivery, including the immediate postpartum period; or
    (2) emergency care in the emergency room of a hospital; the amount of damages awarded for
noneconomic losses must not exceed $500,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom
the action is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with respect to the same
occurrence.

   (b) The limitation imposed by this subdivision must not be disclosed to the trier of fact by any
person at trial.
    Subd. 3. Findings. (a) A court in an action tried without a jury shall make a finding as to
noneconomic loss without regard to the limit under subdivision 2. If noneconomic loss in excess of
the limit is found, the court shall make any reduction required under this section and shall award as
damages for noneconomic loss the lesser of the reduced amount or the limit.
    (b) If an action is before a jury, the jury shall make a finding as to noneconomic loss without
regard to the limit under subdivision 2. If the jury finds that noneconomic loss exceeds the limit,
the court shall make any reduction required under this section and shall award as damages for
noneconomic loss the lesser of the reduced amount or the limit.
   Subd. 4. Punitive damages limited. Punitive, exemplary, and similar damages recoverable
against a health care provider in a cause of action described in subdivision 2 must not exceed
$250,000. The jury must not be informed of this limitation.

   (4) 15 percent of that portion of damages that exceeds $600,000.
    (b) This subdivision applies to the net damages actually recovered by that plaintiff under the
cause of action, whether through settlement, alternative dispute resolution, court judgment, or
otherwise. "Net damages actually recovered" means the net sum recovered after deducting any
disbursements or costs incurred in connection with prosecution or settlement of the claim, including
all costs paid or advanced by any person. Costs of health care incurred by the plaintiff and the
attorney's office overhead costs or charges for legal services are not deductible disbursements of
costs for such purpose.
    (c) A fee agreement that violates this subdivision is void and unenforceable to the extent of the
violation.
    Subd. 6. Intentional discriminatory denial of treatment. Except for the purposes of
subdivision 5, an action described in subdivision 2 shall not be construed to include any claim in a
civil action that is based solely on intentional denial of medical treatment that a patient is otherwise
qualified to receive, against the wishes of a patient, or, if the patient is incompetent, against the
wishes of the patient's guardian, on the basis of the patient's present or predicted age, disability,
degree of medical dependency, or quality of life.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to actions arising
from incidents occurring on or after that date.

   Section 1. [256.0122] HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SPENDING TARGETS.
    During each fiscal year, beginning July 1, 2009, the commissioners of health and human
services shall manage spending on health and human services programs receiving general fund
appropriations to ensure that the annual aggregate spending growth for these programs for the next
fiscal year does not exceed spending for the previous fiscal year plus an annual growth rate equal
to the change in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (CPI-U). The annual spending
growth for specific programs may differ from this aggregate spending target. The commissioners
shall take all steps necessary to manage program spending growth to ensure compliance with
spending targets, including but not limited to reducing administrative costs and modifying program
eligibility, covered services, and grant levels, and shall seek any necessary federal approvals. The
commissioners shall annually report to the legislature any actions that have been or will be taken to
comply with this section, beginning June 1, 2009, and each June 1 thereafter. The commissioners
shall also provide the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with
jurisdiction over health and human services policy and spending with at least seven days' notice of
specific actions the commissioners plan to take to comply with this section.
   Sec. 2. [256L.20] MINNESOTACARE FOR MORE FAMILIES PROGRAM.
   Subdivision 1. Establishment. The commissioner shall establish the MinnesotaCare for More
Families (CMF) program. The commissioner shall implement the program on January 1, 2010, or
upon federal approval, whichever is later. Upon implementation, the MinnesotaCare CMF program
shall replace MinnesotaCare coverage provided to families and children under this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Eligibility. Families and children with family income equal to or less than 300 percent
of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size are eligible for the MinnesotaCare
CMF program. Families and children must meet all other eligibility criteria of this chapter, unless
the legislature modifies the eligibility criteria based upon the recommendation of the commissioner
under subdivision 7.
   Subd. 3. Program design. (a) Enrollees covered under the MinnesotaCare CMF program must
purchase a high-deductible health plan, and must manage a medical benefit account. Money in the
account may be used to pay for health care services subject to a deductible, qualified health care
expenses, and other expenses specified by the commissioner.
    (b) Covered services under the program consist of all comprehensive health maintenance
services covered under a standard HMO contract, as defined under section 62D.02, subdivision 7,
and Minnesota Rules, chapter 4685.
    Subd. 4. Premiums. Families and children shall pay a premium based on the sliding scale
specified in section 256L.15, except that the commissioner shall extend the premium scale to
include families and children with income up to 300 percent of the federal poverty guidelines.
   Subd. 5. Program criteria. (a) The MinnesotaCare CMF program must meet the criteria
specified in this subdivision.
    (b) Payments to health care providers for covered services must be substantially equivalent to

the Internal Revenue Code, sections 220 and 223, and related federal regulations.
    (d) The high-deductible health plan must be linked to a health savings account that qualifies
under sections 220 and 223 of the Internal Revenue Code. The commissioner shall recommend to
the legislature any special administrative or other provisions necessary regarding access by enrollees
to those accounts.
   (e) The MinnesotaCare CMF program shall deposit a minimum of 50 percent of the enrollee
deductible into each health savings account for each year, which must comply with federal limits
and other provisions. Funds in the account may be used to cover deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance,
and other enrollee out-of-pocket costs, and amounts not so spent may accumulate from year to year
and accrue earnings from investments.
   (f) The MinnesotaCare CMF program shall subsidize the premium for the enrollee's
high-deductible health plan based upon the sliding fee scale referenced in subdivision 4.
    (g) The program must be designed to achieve a balance of affordability, access to care, choice
of providers, and incentives to use health care in a cost-effective manner.
   Subd. 6. Waivers and federal approval. The commissioner shall seek all necessary federal
approvals to implement the MinnesotaCare CMF program and to use federal medical assistance
and state children's health insurance program dollars to pay for services covered under the
MinnesotaCare CMF program.
    Subd. 7. Legislative changes. The commissioner shall present to the legislature, by December
15, 2008, all legislative changes necessary to implement the MinnesotaCare CMF program.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 295.52, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

beginning September 1, 2009, the commissioner of finance shall determine the projected balance
of the health care access fund at the end of the current biennium, based on the most recent February
forecast adjusted for any legislative session changes. If the commissioner of finance projects a
surplus in the health care access fund at the end of the current biennium, the commissioner of
finance, in consultation with the commissioners of health and human services, shall reduce the tax
rates specified in subdivisions 1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4 in one-tenth of one percent increments, making
the largest reduction in tax rates consistent with ensuring that the health care access fund retains
a surplus at the end of the current biennium. The reduced tax rates take effect on the January 1
that immediately follows the September 1 on which the commissioner of finance determines the
projected balance and shall remain in effect for two tax years. The tax rates specified in subdivisions
1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4 apply for subsequent tax years, unless the commissioner of finance, based on
a determination of the projected balance of the health care access fund made on September 1 of
an odd-numbered year, reduces the tax rates. If the commissioner of finance does not project a
surplus in the health care access fund at the end of the current biennium, the tax rates specified in
subdivisions 1, 1a, 2, 3, and 4 continue to apply. The commissioner of finance shall publish in the
State Register by October 1 of each odd-numbered year the amount of tax to be imposed for the
next two calendar years.

The appraisal must be in conformity with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice
of the Appraisal Foundation.
    (c) Before offering surplus state-owned lands for public sale, the lands shall first be offered to
the city, county, town, school district, or other public body corporate or politic in which the lands
are situated for public purposes and the lands may be sold for public purposes for not less than the
appraised value of the lands. To determine whether a public body desires to purchase the surplus
land, the commissioner shall give a written notice to the governing body of each political subdivision
whose jurisdictional boundaries include or are adjacent to the surplus land. If a public body desires
to purchase the surplus land, it shall submit a written offer to the commissioner no later than two
weeks after receipt of notice setting forth in detail its reasons for desiring to acquire and its intended

shall determine which party shall receive the property and shall submit written findings regarding
the decision. If lands are offered for sale for public purposes and if a public body notifies the
commissioner of its desire to acquire the lands, the public body may have up to two years from
the date of the accepted offer to commence payment for the lands in the manner provided by law.

The purchaser must pay at the time of sale ten percent of the total amount bid and the remainder of
the payment is due within 90 days of the sale date. A person who fails to make final payment within
90 days of the sale date is in default. On default, all right, title, and interest of the purchaser or heirs,
representatives, or assigns of the purchaser in the premises shall terminate without the state doing
any act or thing. A record of the default must be made in the state land records of the commissioner.

above the ground; and
    (3) the prohibition in clause (1) does not apply to feed that is present solely as a result of normal
agriculture, forest management, or wildlife feed planting practices. It also does not apply to feed
that is for agricultural or livestock purposes if the feed is:
   (i) placed for domestic livestock that are present and actively consuming the feed on a daily
basis;
    (ii) covered to deter deer or elk from gaining access to the feed; or
    (iii) stored consistently with normal agricultural practices.

leased under this section must be acquired in accordance with this subdivision.
    (b) The commissioner must notify the county board and the town officers where the land is
located and furnish them a description of the land to be acquired. The county board must approve
or disapprove the proposed acquisition within 90 days after being notified. The commissioner may
extend the time up to 30 days. The soil and water conservation district supervisors shall counsel the
county board on drainage and flood control and the best utilization and capability of the land.
  (c) If the county board approves the acquisition within the prescribed time, the commissioner
may acquire the land.
    (d) If the county board disapproves the acquisition, it must state valid reasons. The commissioner
may not purchase or lease the land if the county board disapproves the acquisition and states its
reasons within the prescribed time period. The landowner or the commissioner may appeal the
disapproval to the district court having jurisdiction where the land is located.
    (e) The commissioner or the owner of the land may submit the proposed acquisition to the
Land Exchange Board if: (1) the county board does not give reason for disapproval, or does not
approve or disapprove the acquisition within the prescribed time period; or (2) the court finds that
the disapproval is arbitrary and capricious, or that the reasons stated for disapproval are invalid.
    (f) The Land Exchange Board must conduct a hearing and make a decision on the acquisition
within 60 days after receiving the proposal. The Land Exchange Board must give notice of the
hearing to the county board, the commissioner, the landowner, and other interested parties. The
Land Exchange Board must consider the interests of the county, the state, and the landowner in
determining whether the acquisition is in the public interest. If a majority of the Land Exchange
Board members approves the acquisition, the commissioner may acquire the land. If a majority
disapproves, the commissioner may not purchase or lease the land.

a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp

    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.
    (d) A license issued electronically and not immediately provided to the licensee shall be mailed

wholesale market value, established as the average price charged at the state's private hatcheries
and contiguous states per volume rates;
  (4) transfer to other government agencies, colleges, or universities for cooperative fish
management and research purposes; and

water sufficient to keep the fish alive, unless the fish:
   (1) is being transported under an aquaculture license as authorized under sections 17.4985 and
17.4986;
   (2) is being transported for a fishing contest weigh-in under section 97C.081;

    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe rules designed to encourage local sporting organizations
to propagate game fish by using rearing ponds. The rules must:
   (1) prescribe methods to acquire brood stock for the ponds by seining public waters;
   (2) allow the sporting organizations to own and use seines and other necessary equipment; and
   (3) prescribe methods for stocking the fish in public waters that give priority to the needs of the
community where the fish are reared and the desires of the organization operating the rearing pond.

  160.93 USER FEES; HIGH-OCCUPANCY VEHICLE AND DYNAMIC SHOULDER
LANES.
    Subdivision 1. Fees authorized. To improve efficiency and provide more options to individuals
traveling in a trunk highway corridor, the commissioner of transportation may charge user fees to
owners or operators of single-occupant vehicles using dynamic shoulder lanes as designated by the
commissioner and any designated high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The fees may be collected using
electronic or other toll-collection methods and may vary in amount with the time of day and level of
traffic congestion within the corridor. The commissioner shall consult with the Metropolitan Council
and obtain necessary federal authorizations before implementing user fees on a high-occupancy
vehicle lane or dynamic shoulder lane. Fees under this section are not subject to section 16A.1283.
    Subd. 2. Deposit of revenues; appropriation. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 2a, money
collected from fees authorized under subdivision 1 must be deposited in a high-occupancy vehicle
lane user fee account in the special revenue fund. A separate account must be established for each

trunk highway corridor. Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (b) From this appropriation the commissioner shall first repay the trunk highway fund and any
other fund source for money spent to install, equip, or modify the corridor for the purposes of
subdivision 1, and then shall pay all the costs of implementing and administering the fee collection
system for that corridor.
   (c) The commissioner shall spend remaining money in the account as follows:
   (1) one-half must be spent for transportation capital improvements within the corridor; and
   (2) one-half must be transferred to the Metropolitan Council for expansion and improvement
of bus transit services within the corridor beyond the level of service provided on the date of
implementation of subdivision 1.
   Subd. 2a. I-35W high-occupancy vehicle and dynamic shoulder lane account. (a) An I-35W
high-occupancy vehicle and dynamic shoulder lane account is established in the special revenue
fund. Money collected from fees authorized under subdivision 1 for the marked Interstate Highway
35W (I-35W) corridor must be deposited in the account and used as described in this subdivision.
Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (b) During the first year of revenue operations, the commissioner shall use the money received
in that year to pay the costs of operating and administering the fee collection system within the
corridor, up to $1,000,000. Any remaining money must be transferred to the Metropolitan Council
for improvement of bus transit services within the I-35W corridor including transit capital expenses.
  (c) During the second and subsequent years of revenue operations, the commissioner shall use
money in the account as follows:
   (1) each year, allocate the lesser amount of $1,000,000 or 75 percent of the revenues for operating
and administering the fee collection system within the corridor;
   (2) transfer the remaining amount up to the amount allocated under clause (1) to the Metropolitan
Council for improvement of bus transit within the corridor including capital expenses; and
    (3) allocate any remaining amount as follows: (i) 25 percent to the commissioner for operating
and administering the fee collection system within the corridor and for transportation capital
improvements that are consistent with the goals of the urban partnership agreement and that are
located within the corridor and (ii) 75 percent to the Metropolitan Council for improvement of bus
transit services within the corridor including transit capital expenses.
    Subd. 3. Rules exemption. With respect to this section, the commissioner is exempt from
statutory rulemaking requirements, including section 14.386, and from sections 160.84 to 160.92
and 161.162 to 161.167.
    Subd. 4. Prohibition. No person may operate a single-occupant vehicle in a designated
high-occupancy vehicle lane or dynamic shoulder lane except in compliance with the requirements
of the commissioner. A person who violates this subdivision is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and
is subject to sections 169.89, subdivisions 1, 2, and 4, and 169.891 and any other provision of
chapter 169 applicable to the commission of a petty misdemeanor traffic offense.

lanes on freeways. The commissioner may operate dynamic shoulder lanes as priced lanes,
general purpose lanes, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, or as shoulders as defined in section 169.01,
subdivision 73. The commissioner may prescribe the conditions under which the lanes may be used.
    (b) The commissioner may not operate a dynamic shoulder lane on marked Trunk Highway 35W
from its intersection with marked Trunk Highway 94 to its intersection with marked Trunk Highway
62 as a general purpose lane. A dynamic shoulder lane along this portion of marked Trunk Highway
35W may only be used by:
   (1) a vehicle with more than one occupant;
   (2) a single-occupant vehicle if the fee under subdivision 1 is paid;
   (3) a transit bus providing public transit, as defined in section 174.22, subdivision 7; and

required to be opened and read in public if the commissioner publishes the public data specified
by section 13.591, subdivision 3, on a state Web site immediately after the deadline for receipt of
bids has passed. Bids for federal-aid highway projects must be conducted in accordance with Code
of Federal Regulations, title 23, section 635. Trunk highway construction contracts, including
design-build contracts, must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, taking into consideration
conformity with the specifications, the purpose for which the contract or purchase is intended,
the status and capability of the vendor, and other considerations imposed in the call for bids. The
commissioner may decide which is the lowest responsible bidder for all contracts and may use the
principles of life-cycle costing, when appropriate, in determining the lowest overall bid. Any or all
bids may be rejected. When competitive bids are required and all bids are rejected, new bids, if
solicited, must be called for as in the first instance, unless otherwise provided by law.

    Sec. 16. [161.3203] CONTRACTS FOR WORK FOR TRUNK HIGHWAY.
    Subdivision 1. Privatization transportation contracts. For purposes of this section,
"privatization transportation contract" means an enforceable agreement, or combination or series
of agreements, by which a private contractor agrees with the commissioner of transportation to
provide work (1) that is incidental to the construction or improvement of trunk highways, or (2)
for maintenance of trunk highways. A privatization transportation contract does not include a
design-build contract as defined in section 161.3410, subdivision 3, contracts awarded pursuant to
section 161.32, work related to utility relocation, utility relocation agreements, state aid agreements,
municipal agreements, interagency agreements, joint powers agreements, partnership agreements,
and grant agreements. Privatization transportation contracts also do not include contracts related
to aerial photos, asbestos investigation or abatement, communications, computer and information
technology, construction contract administration, cultural resource investigations, electronic
communications, environmental investigations, expert witnesses, contaminated soil investigations
and remediation, geographic information systems, hydraulic and geotechnical studies, intelligent
transportation systems, management support, mapping and photogrammetrics, market research,
medical analysis, planning, public relations, right-of-way appraisals or acquisitions and field title
investigations, research, relocation services, special studies, traffic studies and modeling, and
employee training, and does not include services by persons licensed under sections 326.02 to
326.15.
    Subd. 2. Applicability. This section applies to privatization transportation contracts in a total
amount greater than $100,000. The requirements imposed by this section are in addition to, and do
not supersede, the requirements of any other applicable section of law.
   Subd. 3. Review of contract costs. (a) Before entering into a privatization transportation
contract, the commissioner of transportation shall prepare a comprehensive written estimate of the
109TH DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, APRIL 30, 2008                                    9277

cost of having the same work provided in the most cost-effective manner by agency employees.
The cost estimate must include all costs of having agency employees provide the work, including
the cost of pension, insurance, and other employee benefits. The cost estimate is nonpublic data,
as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, until the day after the deadline for receipt of responses
under paragraph (b), when it becomes public data.
    (b) After soliciting and receiving responses, the commissioner shall publicly designate the
responder to which it proposes to award the privatization contract. The commissioner shall prepare
a comprehensive written estimate of the cost of the proposal based on the designated responder's
bid, including the cost of a transition from public to private provision of the work, any additional
unemployment and retirement benefits resulting from the transfer, and costs associated with
monitoring the proposed contract. If the designated responder proposes to perform any or all of
the desired services outside the state, the commissioner of transportation shall include in the cost
estimate, as nearly as possible, any loss of sales and income tax revenue to the state. The cost
estimate must not include trade secret data which is classified as nonpublic data under section
13.37, subdivision 2.
   (c) Before entering into a privatization transportation contract for $250,000 or more, the
commissioner shall determine that:
       (1) the cost estimated under paragraph (b) will be lower than the cost estimated under paragraph
(a);
    (2) the quality of the work to be provided by the designated responder is likely to equal or exceed
the quality of services that could be provided by Department of Transportation employees;
    (3) the contract, together with other privatization transportation contracts to which the
department is or has been party, will not reduce full-time equivalent positions within the department
or result in layoffs; and
       (4) the proposed privatization contract is in the public interest.
    Subd. 4. Reports. Beginning in 2009, the commissioner shall provide, no later than September
1, an annual written report to the legislature, in compliance with sections 3.195 and 3.197, and
shall submit the report to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees having
jurisdiction over transportation. The report must list all privatization transportation contracts within
the meaning of this section that were executed or performed, whether wholly or in part, in the
previous fiscal year. The report must identify, with respect to each contract: the contractor; contract
amount; duration; work, provided or to be provided; the comprehensive estimate derived under
subdivision 3, paragraph (a); the comprehensive estimate derived under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b); the actual cost to the agency of the contractor's performance of the contract; and for contracts
of at least $250,000, a statement containing the commissioner's determinations under subdivision
3, paragraph (c).
   Subd. 5. Short title. This section may be cited as the "Taxpayers' Transportation Accountability
Act."
       Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.53, is amended to read:

all funds appropriated to the commissioner other than county state-aid and municipal state-aid
highway funds for transportation research including public and private research partnerships.
The commissioner shall spend this money for (1) research to improve the design, construction,
maintenance, management, and environmental compatibility of transportation systems; (2) research
on transportation policies that enhance energy efficiency and economic development; (3) programs
for implementing and monitoring research results; and (4) development of transportation education
and outreach activities. Of all funds appropriated to the commissioner other than state-aid funds,

   165.03 STRENGTH OF BRIDGE; INSPECTION.
    Subdivision 1. Standards generally. Each bridge, including a privately owned bridge, must
conform to the strength, width, clearance, and safety standards imposed by the commissioner for the
connecting highway or street. This subdivision applies to a bridge that is constructed after August
1, 1989, on any public highway or street. The bridge must have sufficient strength to support with
safety the maximum vehicle weights allowed under sections 169.822 to 169.829 and must have the
minimum width specified in section 165.04, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 1a. Inspection. (a) Each bridge must be inspected annually, unless a longer interval not
to exceed two years for bridges or four years for bridges classified as culverts is authorized by
the commissioner. The commissioner's authorization must be based on factors including, but not
limited to, the age and condition of the bridge, the rate of deterioration of the bridge, the type of
structure, the susceptibility of the bridge to failure, and the characteristics of traffic on the bridge.
The commissioner may require interim inspections at intervals of less than one year on bridges that
are posted, bridges subjected to extreme scour conditions, bridges subject to significant substructure
movement or settlement, and for other reasons as specified or inferred in the AASHTO manual.
    (b) The thoroughness of each inspection depends on such factors as age, traffic characteristics,
state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The evaluation of these factors is the responsibility
of the engineer assigned the responsibility for inspection as defined by rule adopted by the
commissioner of transportation.
    Subd. 2. Inspection and inventory responsibilities; rules; forms. (a) The commissioner of
transportation shall adopt official inventory and bridge inspection report forms for use in making
bridge inspections by the owners or highway authorities specified by this subdivision. B      ­­r­d

    (b) The commissioner of transportation shall prescribe the standards for bridge inspection and
inventory by rules. The owner or highway authority shall inspect and inventory in accordance with
these standards and furnish the commissioner with such data as may be necessary to maintain a
central inventory.

A person shall immediately apply for a salvage certificate of title if the person acquires a damaged
late-model or high-value motor vehicle with an out-of-state title and the vehicle:
     (1) is a vehicle that was acquired by an insurer through payment of damages;
     (2) is a vehicle for which the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the damaged vehicle; or
     (3) has an out-of-state salvage certificate of title as proof of ownership.
    (c) A self-insured owner of a late-model or high-value vehicle who sustains damage by collision
or other occurrence which exceeds 70 percent of its actual cash value shall immediately apply for a
salvage certificate of title. Damage, for the purpose of this calculation, does not include the actual
cost incurred to repair, replace, or reinstall inflatable safety restraints and other vehicle components
that must be replaced due to the deployment of the inflatable safety restraints.

    Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.041, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Towing order required. A towing authority may not tow a motor vehicle from
public property unless a peace officer or parking enforcement officer has prepared, in addition
to the parking citation, a written towing report describing the motor vehicle and the reasons for
towing. The report must be signed by the officer and the tow driver. Within the Department of
Transportation's eight-county metropolitan district, an authorized employee of the department's
freeway service patrol may order a tow from a trunk highway after preparing a written towing
report provided by the Minnesota State Patrol. A citation need not be issued before the employee
orders a tow.
    Except in cases where an accident or traffic hazard to the traveling public exists, the department
employee shall ensure that if the tower requested to remove the vehicle by the owner arrives before
the tower requested by the department, the tower requested by the owner is given the opportunity
to actually conduct and complete all towing operations requested.
    Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
    (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign at such place prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the

intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
     (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.

     (3) Steady red indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular red signal alone must stop at a clearly marked stop line
but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then
before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the

must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.

issued under paragraph (b) for failure to meet annual certification requirements prescribed by
the commissioner or failure to inspect commercial motor vehicles in accordance with inspection
procedures established by the State Patrol. The commissioner shall revoke a certificate issued
under paragraph (b) if the commissioner determines after notice and an opportunity for a hearing
that the certified person issued an inspection decal for a commercial motor vehicle when the person
knew or reasonably should have known that the vehicle was in such a state of repair that it would
have been declared out of service if inspected by an employee of the State Patrol. Suspension and
revocation of certificates under this subdivision are not subject to sections 14.57 to 14.69.
    Subd. 4. Inspection report. (a) A person performing an inspection under this section shall
issue an inspection report to the owner of the commercial motor vehicle inspected. The report must
include:
   (1) the full name of the person performing the inspection, and the person's inspector certification
number;
   (2) the name of the owner of the vehicle and, if applicable, the United States Department of
Transportation carrier number issued to the owner of the vehicle, or to the operator of the vehicle if
other than the owner;
   (3) the vehicle identification number and, if applicable, the license plate number of the vehicle;
   (4) the date and location of the inspection;
    (5) the vehicle components inspected and a description of the findings of the inspection,
including identification of the components not in compliance with federal motor carrier safety
regulations; and
   (6) the inspector's certification that the inspection was complete, accurate, and in compliance
with the requirements of this section.
    (b) The owner must retain a copy of the inspection report for at least 14 months at a location in
the state where the vehicle is domiciled or maintained. The inspector must maintain a copy of the
inspection report for a period of 14 months following the inspection in a location in the state where
the inspector conducts business. During this period the report must be available for inspection by
an authorized federal, state, or local official.
    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the inspection report and revise it as necessary
to comply with state and federal law and regulations. The adoption of the report form is not subject
to the Administrative Procedure Act.
    Subd. 5. Inspection decal. ­(­

                                  ) A person inspecting a commercial motor vehicle shall issue an
inspection decal for the vehicle if each inspected component of the vehicle complies with federal
motor carrier safety regulations. The decal must state that in the month specified on the decal
the vehicle was inspected and each inspected component complied with federal motor carrier
safety regulations. The decal is valid for 12 months after the month specified on the decal. The
commissioners of public safety and transportation shall make decals available, at a fee of not more
than $2 for each decal, to persons certified to perform inspections under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b). Decals are issued to inspectors by serial number and are not transferable unless approved by
the commissioner.

       Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.782, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Driver; daily inspection report. (a) The driver of a commercial motor vehicle
shall report in writing at the completion of each day's work on each commercial motor vehicle
the driver has operated. A person who owns one or more commercial motor vehicles and who
employs drivers for those commercial motor vehicles must require each driver to submit a written
report as required ­n
                   i­ by this section. The report must cover the following parts and accessories:
service brakes, including trailer and semitrailer brake connections; parking (hand) brake; steering

mirror or mirrors; coupling devices; wheels and rims; and emergency equipment.
    (b) The report must identify the vehicle and list any defect or deficiency discovered by or reported
to the driver that would affect the safe operation of the vehicle or result in its mechanical breakdown.
If no defect or deficiency is discovered by or reported to the driver, the report must so indicate. The
driver must sign the report after completing it. In the case of a commercial motor vehicle operated by
two drivers, the signature of one of the drivers satisfies the requirements of this subdivision if both
drivers agree concerning the defects or deficiencies. If a driver operates more than one commercial
motor vehicle during a day's work, a report must be prepared for each vehicle operated.
    (c) Before operating or allowing the operation of a commercial motor vehicle on which a report
has been prepared under this subdivision, the owner of the vehicle or the owner's agent must repair
defects or deficiencies listed on the report that would ­             b­ ­

    (b) Statewide, no semitrailer may exceed 48 feet in overall length, including bumper and
load, but excluding non-cargo-carrying equipment, such as refrigeration units or air compressors,
necessary for safe and efficient operation and located on the end of the semitrailer adjacent to the
truck-tractor. However, statewide, a single semitrailer may exceed 48 feet, but not 53 feet, if the
distance from the kingpin to the centerline of the rear axle group of the semitrailer does not exceed
43 feet.
    (c) Statewide, no single trailer may have an overall length exceeding 45 feet, including the tow
bar assembly but exclusive of rear bumpers that do not increase the overall length by more than six
inches.
   (d) For determining compliance with this subdivision, the length of the semitrailer or trailer must
be determined separately from the overall length of the combination of vehicles.
   (e) No semitrailer or trailer used in a three-vehicle combination may have an overall length in
excess of 28-1/2 feet, exclusive of:
    (1) non-cargo-carrying accessory equipment, including refrigeration units or air compressors and
upper coupler plates, necessary for safe and efficient operation, located on the end of the semitrailer
or trailer adjacent to the truck or truck-tractor;
    (2) the tow bar assembly; and
    (3) lower coupler equipment that is a fixed part of the rear end of the first semitrailer or trailer.
    Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.81, subdivision 3c, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3c. Recreational vehicle combination. Notwithstanding subdivision 3, a recreational
vehicle combination may be operated without a permit if:
    (1) the combination does not consist of more than three vehicles, and the towing rating of the
full-size pickup truck or recreational truck-tractor is equal to or greater than the total weight of all
vehicles being towed;
    (2) the combination does not exceed 70 feet in length;

Notwithstanding the maximum weight provisions of this section and section 169.85, and in order
to promote the reduction of fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, the maximum gross
vehicle weight limits and the axle weight limits for any motor vehicle subject to sections 169.80
to 169.88 and equipped with idle reduction technology must be increased by the amount of weight
necessary to compensate for the weight of the idle reduction technology, not to exceed 400 pounds.
At the request of an authorized representative of the Department of Transportation or the Department
of Public Safety, the vehicle operator shall provide proof that the vehicle is equipped with this
technology through documentation or demonstration.

the vehicles to be moved from a trailer manufacturer to a trailer dealer only while operating on
twin-trailer routes designated under section 169.81, subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
    (e) For vehicles which have axle weights exceeding the weight limitations of sections 169.822
to 169.829, an additional cost added to the fees listed above. However, this paragraph applies to
any vehicle described in section 168.013, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), but only when the vehicle
exceeds its gross weight allowance set forth in that paragraph, and then the additional cost is for
all weight, including the allowance weight, in excess of the permitted maximum axle weight. The
additional cost is equal to the product of the distance traveled times the sum of the overweight axle
group cost factors shown in the following chart:

The amounts added are rounded to the nearest cent for each axle or axle group. The additional cost
does not apply to paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (3).
For a vehicle found to exceed the appropriate maximum permitted weight, a cost-per-mile fee of 22
cents per ton, or fraction of a ton, over the permitted maximum weight is imposed in addition to the
normal permit fee. Miles must be calculated based on the distance already traveled in the state plus
the distance from the point of detection to a transportation loading site or unloading site within the
state or to the point of exit from the state.
    (f) As an alternative to paragraph (e), an annual permit may be issued for overweight, or oversize
and overweight, construction equipment, machinery, and supplies. The fees for the permit are as
follows:

(a) The council may contract for services necessary for the provision of special transportation.
Transportation service provided under a contract must specify the service to be provided, the
standards that must be met, and the rates for operating and providing special transportation services.
    (b) The council shall establish management policies for the service and may contract with a
service administrator for day-to-day administration and management of the service. Any contract
must delegate to the service administrator clear authority to administer and manage the delivery
of the service pursuant to council management policies and must establish performance and
compliance standards for the service administrator. The council may provide directly day to day
administration and management of the service and may own or lease vehicles used to provide the
service.
   (c) The council shall ensure that the service administrator establishes a system for registering
and expeditiously responding to complaints by users, informing users of how to register complaints,
and requiring providers to report on incidents that impair the safety and well-being of users or the
quality of the service.

within, the metropolitan area, and (2) to ensure that rail transit lines will interface with each other
and other transportation facilities and services so as to provide a unified, integrated, and efficient
multimodal transportation system.
   Subd. 4. Expenditure of state funds. No state funds may be expended by the Metropolitan
Council to study a particular light rail transit or commuter rail facility unless the funds are
appropriated in legislation that identifies the route, including the origin and destination.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 102. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.3993, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Final design plan. "Final design plan" means a light rail transit plan that includes the
items in the preliminary design plan and the preliminary engineering plan for the facilities proposed
but with greater detail and specificity needed for construction. The final design plan must include,
at a minimum:
    (1) final plans for the physical design of facilities, including the right-of-way definition;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures; intermodal coordination with bus operations and
routes; and civil engineering plans for vehicles, track, stations, parking, and access, including
disability access; and
    (2) final plans for civil engineering for electrification, communication, and other similar
facilities; operational rules, procedures, and strategies; capital costs; ridership; operating costs and
revenues, and sources of funds for operating subsidies; financing for construction and operation;
an implementation method; and other similar matters.
    The final design plan must be stated with sufficient particularity and detail to allow the proposer
to begin the acquisition and construction of operable facilities. If a design-build implementation
method is proposed, instead of civil engineering plans the final design plan must state detailed design
criteria and performance standards for the facilities.

of government that disapproves the change shall describe specific amendments to the plans that, if
adopted, would cause the local unit to withdraw its disapproval. Failure to approve or disapprove
the changed plans in writing within the time period is deemed to be approval, unless an extension

    (2) analysis and quantification of the needs for the next 20 years of the state's highway systems,
bridges, and transit;
   (3) comparison of estimates of revenues raised by current transportation funding sources, with
long-term needs of the state's transportation system;
    (4) identification of options for maintenance and improvement of the state's transportation
system with specific reference to the effects of potential increases in vehicle fuel economy,
availability of alternative modes of transportation, and extreme fuel price volatility on future
transportation revenues;
    (5) analysis of alternative pricing options utilized in other states and countries, and their potential
for use, public acceptance, alleviation of congestion, and revenue generation in this state; and
    (6) identification of options for road-use pricing, other alternative financing mechanisms with
particular consideration of key environmental impacts such as air quality, water quality, and
greenhouse gas emissions, and estimates of implementation costs, user costs, and revenue.

     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 168.10, subdivision 1h, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1h. Collector military vehicle. (a) A motor vehicle, including a truck, shall be listed and
registered under this section if it meets the following conditions:
     (1) it is at least 20 years old;
    (2) its first owner following its manufacture was a branch of the armed forces of the United
States and it presently conforms to the vehicle specifications required during the time of military
ownership, or it has been restored and presently conforms to the specifications required by a branch
of the armed forces for the model year that the restored vehicle could have been owned by that
branch of the armed forces; and
   (3) it is owned by a nonprofit organization and operated solely as a collector's vehicle. For
purposes of this subdivision, "nonprofit organization" means a corporation, society, association,
foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for historical or educational purposes,
no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of a private individual.
    (b) The owner of the vehicle shall execute an affidavit stating the name and address of the
person from whom purchased and of the new owner; the make, year, and model number of
the motor vehicle; the manufacturer's identification number; and the collector military vehicle
identification number, if any, located on the exterior of the vehicle. The affidavit must affirm
that the vehicle is owned by a nonprofit organization and is operated solely as a collector's item
and not for general transportation purposes. If the ­      r­

manufactured home under the provisions of sections 327.61 to 327.67.
   Sec. 5. [327.665] REINSTATEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Right to reinstate. (a) If the debtor does not cure the default within the 30-day
period specified in section 327.66, the secured party must send a registered or certified letter and
concurrently send a copy of the notice by first class mail to the occupant of the home and, if the
debtor is different than the occupant, to the debtor, stating that the debtor has 30 days to reinstate
the loan by paying the defaulted amount plus additional allowable fees incurred by the secured party
in order to regain possession of the home.
   (b) If the debtor does not sign for the registered or certified letter containing the notice
within seven calendar days of the first attempted delivery, the secured party may proceed with all
permissible actions provided in statute as though the debtor's signature had been secured.
    Subd. 2. Required notice; contents of notice. (a) The notice shall contain, at a minimum, the
following information:
    (1) the name of the secured party, the debtor, each current assignee of the loan, if any, and the
original or maximum principal amount secured by the loan;
   (2) the date of the loan;
   (3) the amount in arrears on the loan as of the date of the notice;
   (4) a description of the manufactured home upon which the loan is secured, conforming
substantially to that contained in the loan documents;

options. If you do not become current on your loan within 30 days, including any additional fees,
you will no longer be entitled to reinstate your loan. We are seeking a court order repossessing the
home, and by court order you will have to vacate the home."
    Subd. 3. Action to repossess; termination of action. At any time after the expiration of the
30-day period required under section 327.64, the creditor may proceed with a court action under
section 327.65, so long as the right to reinstate has not been exercised. The exercise of the right
to reinstatement in accordance with the provisions of this section shall suspend the secured party's
right to seek repossession of the manufactured home under the provisions of sections 327.61 to
327.67 and shall immediately terminate any court action filed pursuant to sections 327.61 to 327.67
or section 565.
    Subd. 4. Allowable costs. For the purposes of this section, allowable costs that can be recovered
include insurance; delinquent taxes, if any, upon the premises; interest to date of payment; cost of
services of process or notices; filing fees; attorney fees, not to exceed $150 or one-half of the attorney
fees authorized by section 582.01, whichever is greater; together with other lawful disbursements
necessarily incurred in connection with the proceedings by the party repossessing.

   (2) brokers shall carry out all lawful instructions given by borrowers;
    (3) brokers shall disclose to borrowers all material facts of which the broker has knowledge

   (4) brokers shall use reasonable care in performing duties; and
   (5) brokers shall account to a borrower for all the borrower's money and property received as an
agent.
   (b) The duty of agency does not attach to a broker who is:

   (3) licensed as a sales finance company as defined under section 53C.01, subdivision 12;

    (2) make or cause to be made, directly or indirectly, any false, deceptive, or misleading
statement or representation in connection with a manufactured home loan transaction, including,
without limitation, a false, deceptive, or misleading statement or representation regarding the
borrower's ability to qualify for any manufactured home loan product;
   (3) issue any document indicating conditional qualification or conditional approval for a
manufactured home loan, unless the document also clearly indicates that final qualification or
approval is not guaranteed, and may be subject to additional review;
    (4) make or assist in making any manufactured home loan without verifying the reasonable
ability of the borrower to repay the loan, taking into consideration taxes and insurance in connection
with the manufactured home;
   (5) make, provide, or arrange for a manufactured home loan for a higher interest rate or on less
favorable terms than the rate or terms for which the borrower qualifies based on criteria typically
used by that lender to evaluate rate and term offerings;
   (6) make, provide, or arrange for a manufactured home loan all or a portion of the proceeds
of which are used to fully or partially pay off a "special loan" unless the borrower has obtained a
written certification from an authorized independent loan counselor that the borrower has received
counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction. For the purposes of this section, "special
loan" means a loan for the purchase, refinance, improvement, or repair of the manufactured
home originated, subsidized, or guaranteed by or through a state, tribal, or local government, or

a nonprofit, third-party individual or organization providing homebuyer education programs,
foreclosure prevention services, loan counseling, or credit counseling certified by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Minnesota Home Ownership Center, the

   (7) engage in churning; or

loan.

federal or state chartered bank, savings bank, credit union, or a licensed sales finance company as
defined under section 53C.01, subdivision 12.

an individual who holds an initial entrance license issued by the State Board of Teaching or the
commissioner of education within the 12 months preceding an offer of employment.
    (b) A school hiring authority may use the results of a criminal background check conducted at
the request of another school hiring authority if:
    (1) the results of the criminal background check are on file with the other school hiring authority
or otherwise accessible;
   (2) the other school hiring authority conducted a criminal background check within the previous
12 months;
   (3) the individual who is the subject of the criminal background check executes a written consent
form giving a school hiring authority access to the results of the check; and
    (4) there is no reason to believe that the individual has committed an act subsequent to the check
that would disqualify the individual for employment.
    (c) A school hiring authority may, at its discretion, request a criminal history background check
from the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on any individual who seeks to

of conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (d) For all nonstate residents who are offered employment in a school, a school hiring authority
shall request a criminal history background check on such individuals from the superintendent of the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and from the government agency performing the same function in
the resident state or, if no government entity performs the same function in the resident state, from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Such individuals must provide an executed criminal history
consent form and a money order, check, or other negotiable instrument payable to the school hiring
authority in an amount equal to the actual cost to the government agencies and the school district of
conducting the criminal history background check. Notwithstanding section 299C.62, subdivision
1, the cost of the criminal history background check under this paragraph is the responsibility of the
individual.
    (e) At the beginning of each school year or when a student enrolls, a school hiring authority
must notify parents and guardians about the school hiring authority's policy requiring a criminal
history background check on employees and other individuals who provide services to the school,
and identify those positions subject to a background check and the extent of the hiring authority's
discretion in requiring a background check. The school hiring authority may include the notice
in the student handbook, a school policy guide, or other similar communication. Nothing in this
paragraph affects a school hiring authority's ability to request a criminal history background check
on an individual under paragraph (c).
    Subd. 2. Conditional hiring and services; discharge. A school hiring authority may hire or
otherwise allow an individual to provide a service to a school pending completion of a background
check under subdivision 1 but shall notify the individual that the individual's employment or other
service may be terminated based on the result of the background check. A school hiring authority
is not liable for failing to hire or for terminating an individual's employment or other service based
on the result of a background check under this section.
   Subd. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (a) "School" means a school as defined in section 120A.22, subdivision 4, except a home school,
and includes a school receiving tribal contract or grant school aid under section 124D.83; school,
for the purposes of this section, also means a service cooperative, a special education cooperative,
or an education district under Minnesota Statutes 1997 Supplement, section 123.35, a charter school
under section 124D.10, and a joint powers district under section 471.59.
   (b) "School hiring authority" means the school board, or in the case of a nonpublic school, the
school principal or other person having general control and supervision of the school.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective September 1, 2008."
