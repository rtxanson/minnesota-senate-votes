    Subd. 2. Permanent bar to set aside a disqualification. (a) Except as provided in paragraph
(b), the commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of any individual disqualified pursuant

    (b) For an individual in the chemical dependency or corrections field who was disqualified for

set aside prior to July 1, 2005, the commissioner must consider granting a variance pursuant to
section 245C.30 for the license holder for a program dealing primarily with adults. A request for
reconsideration evaluated under this paragraph must include a letter of recommendation from the
license holder that was subject to the prior set-aside decision addressing the individual's quality of
care to children or vulnerable adults and the circumstances of the individual's departure from that
service.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256.01, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Specific powers. Subject to the provisions of section 241.021, subdivision 2, the
commissioner of human services shall carry out the specific duties in paragraphs (a) through (cc):
    (a) Administer and supervise all forms of public assistance provided for by state law and other
welfare activities or services as are vested in the commissioner. Administration and supervision of
human services activities or services includes, but is not limited to, assuring timely and accurate
distribution of benefits, completeness of service, and quality program management. In addition
to administering and supervising human services activities vested by law in the department, the
commissioner shall have the authority to:
   (1) require county agency participation in training and technical assistance programs to promote
compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations, and policies governing human services;
10566                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

   (2) monitor, on an ongoing basis, the performance of county agencies in the operation and
administration of human services, enforce compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations,
and policies governing welfare services and promote excellence of administration and program
operation;
   (3) develop a quality control program or other monitoring program to review county performance
and accuracy of benefit determinations;
    (4) require county agencies to make an adjustment to the public assistance benefits issued to any
individual consistent with federal law and regulation and state law and rule and to issue or recover
benefits as appropriate;
   (5) delay or deny payment of all or part of the state and federal share of benefits and
administrative reimbursement according to the procedures set forth in section 256.017;
   (6) make contracts with and grants to public and private agencies and organizations, both profit
and nonprofit, and individuals, using appropriated funds; and
    (7) enter into contractual agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes with a reservation
in Minnesota to the extent necessary for the tribe to operate a federally approved family assistance
program or any other program under the supervision of the commissioner. The commissioner shall
consult with the affected county or counties in the contractual agreement negotiations, if the county
or counties wish to be included, in order to avoid the duplication of county and tribal assistance
program services. The commissioner may establish necessary accounts for the purposes of receiving
and disbursing funds as necessary for the operation of the programs.
   (b) Inform county agencies, on a timely basis, of changes in statute, rule, federal law, regulation,
and policy necessary to county agency administration of the programs.
     (c) Administer and supervise all child welfare activities; promote the enforcement of laws
protecting disabled, dependent, neglected and delinquent children, and children born to mothers
who were not married to the children's fathers at the times of the conception nor at the births of the
children; license and supervise child-caring and child-placing agencies and institutions; supervise
the care of children in boarding and foster homes or in private institutions; and generally perform
all functions relating to the field of child welfare now vested in the State Board of Control.
    (d) Administer and supervise all noninstitutional service to disabled persons, including those
who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or physically impaired or otherwise disabled. The
commissioner may provide and contract for the care and treatment of qualified indigent children in
facilities other than those located and available at state hospitals when it is not feasible to provide
the service in state hospitals.
   (e) Assist and actively cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, local, state,
and federal, by performing services in conformity with the purposes of Laws 1939, chapter 431.
    (f) Act as the agent of and cooperate with the federal government in matters of mutual concern
relative to and in conformity with the provisions of Laws 1939, chapter 431, including the
administration of any federal funds granted to the state to aid in the performance of any functions
of the commissioner as specified in Laws 1939, chapter 431, and including the promulgation of
rules making uniformly available medical care benefits to all recipients of public assistance, at such
times as the federal government increases its participation in assistance expenditures for medical

care to recipients of public assistance, the cost thereof to be borne in the same proportion as are
grants of aid to said recipients.
   (g) Establish and maintain any administrative units reasonably necessary for the performance of
administrative functions common to all divisions of the department.
    (h) Act as designated guardian of both the estate and the person of all the wards of the state
of Minnesota, whether by operation of law or by an order of court, without any further act or
proceeding whatever, except as to persons committed as developmentally disabled. For children
under the guardianship of the commissioner or a tribe in Minnesota recognized by the Secretary
of the Interior whose interests would be best served by adoptive placement, the commissioner
may contract with a licensed child-placing agency or a Minnesota tribal social services agency
to provide adoption services. A contract with a licensed child-placing agency must be designed
to supplement existing county efforts and may not replace existing county programs or tribal
social services, unless the replacement is agreed to by the county board and the appropriate
exclusive bargaining representative, tribal governing body, or the commissioner has evidence that
child placements of the county continue to be substantially below that of other counties. Funds
encumbered and obligated under an agreement for a specific child shall remain available until the
terms of the agreement are fulfilled or the agreement is terminated.
   (i) Act as coordinating referral and informational center on requests for service for newly arrived
immigrants coming to Minnesota.
   (j) The specific enumeration of powers and duties as hereinabove set forth shall in no way be
construed to be a limitation upon the general transfer of powers herein contained.
   (k) Establish county, regional, or statewide schedules of maximum fees and charges which may
be paid by county agencies for medical, dental, surgical, hospital, nursing and nursing home care
and medicine and medical supplies under all programs of medical care provided by the state and for
congregate living care under the income maintenance programs.
    (l) Have the authority to conduct and administer experimental projects to test methods and
procedures of administering assistance and services to recipients or potential recipients of public
welfare. To carry out such experimental projects, it is further provided that the commissioner
of human services is authorized to waive the enforcement of existing specific statutory program
requirements, rules, and standards in one or more counties. The order establishing the waiver
shall provide alternative methods and procedures of administration, shall not be in conflict with
the basic purposes, coverage, or benefits provided by law, and in no event shall the duration of a
project exceed four years. It is further provided that no order establishing an experimental project
as authorized by the provisions of this section shall become effective until the following conditions
have been met:
   (1) the secretary of health and human services of the United States has agreed, for the same
project, to waive state plan requirements relative to statewide uniformity; and
  (2) a comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs, shall be approved by the Legislative
Advisory Commission and filed with the commissioner of administration.
   (m) According to federal requirements, establish procedures to be followed by local welfare

members.
    (n) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions which are based on quality control error
rates for the aid to families with dependent children program formerly codified in sections 256.72
to 256.87, medical assistance, or food stamp program in the following manner:
    (1) one-half of the total amount of the disallowance shall be borne by the county boards
responsible for administering the programs. For the medical assistance and the AFDC program
formerly codified in sections 256.72 to 256.87, disallowances shall be shared by each county
board in the same proportion as that county's expenditures for the sanctioned program are to the
total of all counties' expenditures for the AFDC program formerly codified in sections 256.72 to
256.87, and medical assistance programs. For the food stamp program, sanctions shall be shared
by each county board, with 50 percent of the sanction being distributed to each county in the same
proportion as that county's administrative costs for food stamps are to the total of all food stamp
administrative costs for all counties, and 50 percent of the sanctions being distributed to each
county in the same proportion as that county's value of food stamp benefits issued are to the total
of all benefits issued for all counties. Each county shall pay its share of the disallowance to the
state of Minnesota. When a county fails to pay the amount due hereunder, the commissioner may
deduct the amount from reimbursement otherwise due the county, or the attorney general, upon the
request of the commissioner, may institute civil action to recover the amount due; and
    (2) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (1), if the disallowance results from knowing
noncompliance by one or more counties with a specific program instruction, and that knowing
noncompliance is a matter of official county board record, the commissioner may require payment
or recover from the county or counties, in the manner prescribed in clause (1), an amount equal to
the portion of the total disallowance which resulted from the noncompliance, and may distribute
the balance of the disallowance according to clause (1).
    (o) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the
recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may
enter into contracts with third parties. Any recoveries that result from projects or contracts entered
into under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account
until the balance in the account reaches $1,000,000. When the balance in the account exceeds
$1,000,000, the excess shall be transferred and credited to the general fund. All money in the
account is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this paragraph.
     (p) Have the authority to make direct payments to facilities providing shelter to women and their
children according to section 256D.05, subdivision 3. Upon the written request of a shelter facility
that has been denied payments under section 256D.05, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall review
all relevant evidence and make a determination within 30 days of the request for review regarding
issuance of direct payments to the shelter facility. Failure to act within 30 days shall be considered
a determination not to issue direct payments.
   (q) Have the authority to establish and enforce the following county reporting requirements:
    (1) the commissioner shall establish fiscal and statistical reporting requirements necessary to
account for the expenditure of funds allocated to counties for human services programs. When
establishing financial and statistical reporting requirements, the commissioner shall evaluate all
reports, in consultation with the counties, to determine if the reports can be simplified or the number
of reports can be reduced;

    (2) the county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required
by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the
month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless
the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid
jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports
that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner;
   (3) if the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (2), the
commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next
reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late
report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county
boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal
funding is received;
    (4) a county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required
format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county
board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason
the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective
action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan
must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received
notice of noncompliance;
    (5) the final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date
the report was originally due. If the commissioner does not receive a report by the final deadline, the
county board forfeits the funding associated with the report for that reporting period and the county
board must repay any funds associated with the report received for that reporting period;
     (6) the commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under
clause (3) or (5) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate
forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements.
If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5), the
county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69; and
   (7) counties subject to withholding of funds under clause (3) or forfeiture or repayment of funds
under clause (5) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred
due to actions taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5).
    (r) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions when federal fiscal
disallowances or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample ­                           f­

payments according to normal department schedules established by the commissioner upon final
approval of allocation methodologies from the United States Department of Health and Human
Services Division of Cost Allocation or other appropriate authorities.

established under section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act.
    Effective January 1, 2006, drug coverage under general assistance medical care shall be limited
to those prescription drugs that:
   (1) are covered under the medical assistance program as described in section 256B.0625,
subdivisions 13 and 13d; and
    (2) are provided by manufacturers that have fully executed general assistance medical care
rebate agreements with the commissioner and comply with such agreements. Prescription drug
coverage under general assistance medical care shall conform to coverage under the medical
assistance program according to section 256B.0625, subdivisions 13 to 13g.

extension, a participant is in compliance in any month that the participant has not been sanctioned.
In order to maintain eligibility for any of the hardship extension categories a participant shall
develop and comply with either an employment plan or a family stabilization services plan,
whichever is appropriate.
    (b) If one participant in a two-parent assistance unit is determined to be ineligible for a hardship
extension, the county shall give the assistance unit the option of disqualifying the ineligible
participant from MFIP. In that case, the assistance unit shall be treated as a one-parent assistance
unit and the assistance unit's MFIP grant shall be calculated using the shared household standard
under section 256J.08, subdivision 82a.
   (c) Prior to denying an extension, the county must review the sanction status and determine
whether the sanction is appropriate or if good cause exists under section 256J.57. If the sanction
was inappropriately applied or the participant is granted a good cause exception before the end of
month 60, the participant shall be considered for an extension.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256J.626, subdivision 3, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3. Eligibility for services. Families with a minor child, a pregnant woman, or a
noncustodial parent of a minor child receiving assistance, with incomes below 200 percent of the
federal poverty guideline for a family of the applicable size, are eligible for services funded under
the consolidated fund. Counties and tribes must give priority to families currently receiving MFIP,
the diversionary work program, or family stabilization services, and families at risk of receiving
MFIP or diversionary work program. A county or tribe shall not impose a residency requirement
on families, except for the residency requirement under section 256J.12.

child care assistance subsidies under this chapter for their own children or children in their family
during the hours they are providing child care or being paid to provide child care. Child care

providers and their employees are eligible to receive child care assistance subsidies for their
children when they are engaged in other activities that meet the requirements of this chapter and
for which child care assistance can be paid. The hours for which the provider or their employee
receives a child care subsidy for their own children must not overlap with the hours the provider
provides child care services.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 119B.231, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 5. Relationship to current law. (a) The following provisions in chapter 119B must be
waived or modified for families receiving services under this section.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 119B.13, subdivisions 1 and 1a, maximum weekly rates under this
section are 125 percent of the existing maximum weekly rate for like-care. Providers eligible for
a differential rate under section 119B.13, subdivision 3a, remain eligible for the differential above
the rate identified in this section. Only care for children who have not yet entered kindergarten
may be paid at the maximum rate under this section. The provider's charge for service provided
through an SRSA may not exceed the rate that the provider charges a private-pay family for like-care
arrangements.
    (c) A family or child care provider may not be assessed an overpayment for care provided
through an SRSA unless:
   (1) there was an error in the amount of care authorized for the family; or
   (2) the family or provider did not timely report a change as required under the law.
   (d) Care provided through an SRSA is authorized on a weekly basis.
    (e) Funds appropriated under this section to serve families eligible under section 119B.03 are
not allocated through the basic sliding fee formula under section 119B.03. Funds appropriated under
this section are used to offset increased costs when payments are made under SRSA's.
    (f) Notwithstanding section 119B.09, subdivision 6, the maximum amount of child care
assistance that may be authorized for a child receiving care through an SRSA in a two-week period
is 160 hours per child.
    (g) Effective upon date of enactment, absent day payment limits under section 119B.13,
subdivision 7, do not apply to children for care paid through SRSA's provided the family remains
eligible under subdivision 3.
   Sec. 5. CHILD CARE ADVISORY TASK FORCE.

the family's child care provider on behalf of the family by a source other than the family shall not
affect the family's eligibility for child care assistance, and the amount paid shall be excluded from
the family's income. Child care providers who accept third-party payments must maintain family
specific documentation of payment source, amount, and time period covered by the payment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 119B.125, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1a. Background study required. This subdivision only applies to legal, nonlicensed
family child care providers. Prior to authorization, and as part of each reauthorization required in
subdivision 1, the county shall perform a background study on every member of the provider's
household who is age 13 and older. The background study shall be conducted according to the
procedures under subdivision 2.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 119B.125, subdivision 2, is amended to

nonlicensed family child care provider's household meets any of the conditions under paragraphs
(b) to (n), the provider must not be authorized as a legal nonlicensed family child care provider. To
determine whether any of the listed conditions exist, the county must request information about the
provider and other household members for whom a background study is required under subdivision
1a from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the juvenile courts, and social service agencies.
When one of the listed entities does not maintain information on a statewide basis, the county must
contact the entity in the county where the provider resides and any other county in which the provider
or any household member previously resided in the past year. For purposes of this subdivision, a
finding that a delinquency petition is proven in juvenile court must be considered a conviction in
state district court. If a county has determined that a provider is able to be authorized in that county,
and a family in another county later selects that provider, the provider is able to be authorized in
the second county without undergoing a new background investigation unless one of the following
conditions exists:
   (1) two years have passed since the first authorization;
   (2) another person age 13 or older has joined the provider's household since the last authorization;
   (3) a current household member has turned 13 since the last authorization; or
   (4) there is reason to believe that a household member has a factor that prevents authorization.
     (b) The person has been convicted of one of the following offenses or has admitted to
committing or a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the person has committed an act that
meets the definition of one of the following offenses: sections 609.185 to 609.195, murder in the
first, second, or third degree; 609.2661 to 609.2663, murder of an unborn child in the first, second,

    (b) Rate changes shall be implemented for services provided in September 2006 unless a
participant eligibility redetermination or a new provider agreement is completed between July 1,
2006, and August 31, 2006.
    As necessary, appropriate notice of adverse action must be made according to Minnesota Rules,
part 3400.0185, subparts 3 and 4.
   New cases approved on or after July 1, 2006, shall have the maximum rates under paragraph (a),
implemented immediately.
    (c) Every year, the commissioner shall survey rates charged by child care providers in Minnesota
to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in counties. When the commissioner
determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol, the number of providers responding
to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate for like-care arrangements in a county
or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the 75th percentile maximum rate based on
like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that the commissioner deems to be similar.
    (d) A rate which includes a special needs rate paid under subdivision 3 or under a school
readiness service agreement paid under section 119B.231, may be in excess of the maximum rate
allowed under this subdivision.
   (e) The department shall monitor the effect of this paragraph on provider rates. The county
shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The
commissioner shall determine the maximum rate for each type of care on an hourly, full-day, and
weekly basis, including special needs and disability care.
    (f) When the provider charge is greater than the maximum provider rate allowed, the parent is
responsible for payment of the difference in the rates in addition to any family co-payment fee.
    (g) All maximum provider rates changes shall be implemented on the Monday following the
effective date of the maximum provider rate.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 119B.13, subdivision 7, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 7. Absent days. (a) Child care providers may not be reimbursed for more than 25 full-day
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10583

absent days per child, excluding holidays, in a fiscal year, or for more than ten consecutive full-day
absent days, unless the child has a documented medical condition that causes more frequent
absences. Absences due to a documented medical condition of a parent or sibling who lives in the
same residence as the child receiving child care assistance do not count against the 25-day absent
day limit in a fiscal year. Documentation of medical conditions must be on the forms and submitted
according to the timelines established by the commissioner. A public health nurse or school nurse
may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a provider sends a child home early due
to a medical reason, including, but not limited to, fever or contagious illness, the child care center
director or lead teacher may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a child attends for
part of the time authorized to be in care in a day, but is absent for part of the time authorized to be
in care in that same day, the absent time will be reimbursed but the time will not count toward the
ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits. Children in families where at least one parent
is under the age of 21, does not have a high school or general equivalency diploma, and is a student
in a school district or another similar program that provides or arranges for child care, as well as
parenting, social services, career and employment supports, and academic support to achieve high
school graduation, may be exempt from the absent day limits upon request of the program and
approval of the county. If a child attends part of an authorized day, payment to the provider must
be for the full amount of care authorized for that day. Child care providers may only be reimbursed
for absent days if the provider has a written policy for child absences and charges all other families
in care for similar absences.
    (b) Child care providers must be reimbursed for up to ten federal or state holidays or designated
holidays per year when the provider charges all families for these days and the holiday or designated
holiday falls on a day when the child is authorized to be in attendance. Parents may substitute other
cultural or religious holidays for the ten recognized state and federal holidays. Holidays do not count
toward the ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits.
    (c) A family or child care provider may not be assessed an overpayment for an absent day
payment unless (1) there was an error in the amount of care authorized for the family, (2) all of
the allowed full-day absent payments for the child have been paid, or (3) the family or provider did
not timely report a change as required under law.
    (d) The provider and family must receive notification of the number of absent days used upon
initial provider authorization for a family and when the family has used 15 cumulative absent
days. Upon statewide implementation of the Minnesota Electronic Child Care System, the provider
and family shall receive notification of the number of absent days used upon initial provider
authorization for a family and ongoing notification of the number of absent days used as of the
date of the notification.
    (e) A county may pay for more absent days than the statewide absent day policy established
under this subdivision if current market practice in the county justifies payment for those additional
days. County policies for payment of absent days in excess of the statewide absent day policy and
justification for these county policies must be included in the county's child care fund plan under
section 119B.08, subdivision 3.

   Subd. 3. Other property limitations. To be eligible for MFIP, the equity value of all
nonexcluded real and personal property of the assistance unit must not exceed $2,000 for applicants
and $5,000 for ongoing participants. The value of assets in clauses (1) to (19) must be excluded
when determining the equity value of real and personal property:
    (1) a licensed vehicle up to a loan value of less than or equal to $15,000. If the assistance
unit owns more than one licensed vehicle, the county agency shall determine the loan value of all
additional vehicles and exclude the combined loan value of less than or equal to $7,500. The county
agency shall apply any excess loan value as if it were equity value to the asset limit described in
this section, excluding: (i) the value of one vehicle per physically disabled person when the vehicle
is needed to transport the disabled unit member; this exclusion does not apply to mentally disabled
people; (ii) the value of special equipment for a disabled member of the assistance unit; and (iii)

member.
    To establish the loan value of vehicles, a county agency must use the N.A.D.A. Official Used
Car Guide, Midwest Edition, for newer model cars. When a vehicle is not listed in the guidebook,
or when the applicant or participant disputes the loan value listed in the guidebook as unreasonable
given the condition of the particular vehicle, the county agency may require the applicant or
participant document the loan value by securing a written statement from a motor vehicle dealer
licensed under section 168.27, stating the amount that the dealer would pay to purchase the vehicle.
The county agency shall reimburse the applicant or participant for the cost of a written statement
that documents a lower loan value;
   (2) the value of life insurance policies for members of the assistance unit;
   (3) one burial plot per member of an assistance unit;
    (4) the value of personal property needed to produce earned income, including tools,
implements, farm animals, inventory, business loans, business checking and savings accounts used
at least annually and used exclusively for the operation of a self-employment business, and any
motor vehicles if at least 50 percent of the vehicle's use is to produce income and if the vehicles
are essential for the self-employment business;
   (5) the value of personal property not otherwise specified which is commonly used by household
members in day-to-day living such as clothing, necessary household furniture, equipment, and other
basic maintenance items essential for daily living;
   (6) the value of real and personal property owned by a recipient of Supplemental Security Income
or Minnesota supplemental aid;
   (7) the value of corrective payments, but only for the month in which the payment is received
and for the following month;
    (8) a mobile home or other vehicle used by an applicant or participant as the applicant's or
participant's home;
    (9) money in a separate escrow account that is needed to pay real estate taxes or insurance and
that is used for this purpose;
   (10) money held in escrow to cover employee FICA, employee tax withholding, sales tax

withholding, employee worker compensation, business insurance, property rental, property taxes,
and other costs that are paid at least annually, but less often than monthly;
    (11) monthly assistance payments for the current month's or short-term emergency needs under
section 256J.626, subdivision 2;
   (12) the value of school loans, grants, or scholarships for the period they are intended to cover;
    (13) payments listed in section 256J.21, subdivision 2, clause (9), which are held in escrow for
a period not to exceed three months to replace or repair personal or real property;
   (14) income received in a budget month through the end of the payment month;
   (15) savings from earned income of a minor child or a minor parent that are set aside in a separate
account designated specifically for future education or employment costs;
    (16) the federal earned income credit, Minnesota working family credit, state and federal income
tax refunds, state homeowners and renters credits under chapter 290A, property tax rebates and other
federal or state tax rebates in the month received and the following month;
   (17) payments excluded under federal law as long as those payments are held in a separate
account from any nonexcluded funds;
    (18) the assets of children ineligible to receive MFIP benefits because foster care or adoption
assistance payments are made on their behalf; and
   (19) the assets of persons whose income is excluded under section 256J.21, subdivision 2, clause
(43).

    The commissioner shall annually publish in the State Register the transitional standard for an
assistance unit sizes 1 to 10 including a breakdown of the cash and food portions.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.521, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Self-employment. (a) Self-employment activities may be included in an employment
plan contingent on the development of a business plan which establishes a timetable and earning
goals that will result in the participant exiting MFIP assistance. Business plans must be developed
with assistance from an individual or organization with expertise in small business as approved by
the job counselor.
   (b) Participants with an approved plan that includes self-employment must meet the participation
requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1. Only hours where the participant earns at least
minimum wage shall be counted toward the requirement. Additional activities and hours necessary
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, must be included in the
employment plan.
   (c) Employment plans which include self-employment activities must be reviewed every three
months. Participants who fail, without good cause, to make satisfactory progress as established in the
business plan must revise the employment plan to replace the self-employment with other approved
work activities.

Minor parents, or 18- or 19-year-old parents without a high school diploma or its equivalent who
chooses an employment plan with an education option must attend school unless:
    (1) transportation services needed to enable the caregiver to attend school are not available;
   (2) appropriate child care services needed to enable the caregiver to attend school are not
available;
    (3) the caregiver is ill or incapacitated seriously enough to prevent attendance at school; or
    (4) the caregiver is needed in the home because of the illness or incapacity of another member
of the household. This includes a caregiver of a child who is younger than six weeks of age.
    (b) The caregiver must be enrolled in a secondary school and meeting the school's attendance
requirements. The county, social service agency, or job counselor must verify at least once per
quarter that the caregiver is meeting the school's attendance requirements. An enrolled caregiver
is considered to be meeting the attendance requirements when the school is not in regular session,
including during holiday and summer breaks.

    Sec. 5. [259.241] ADULT ADOPTION.
  (a) Any adult person may be adopted, regardless of his or her residence. A resident of Minnesota
may petition the court of record having jurisdiction of adoption proceedings to adopt an individual
who has reached the age of 18 years or older.
    (b) The consent of the person to be adopted shall be the only consent necessary, according to
section 259.24. The consent of an adult in his or her own adoption is invalid if the adult is considered
to be a vulnerable adult under section 626.5572, subdivision 21, or if the person consenting to the
adoption is determined not competent to give consent.
    (c) The decree of adoption establishes a parent-child relationship between the adopting parent
or parents and the person adopted, including the right to inherit, and also terminates the parental
rights and sibling relationship between the adopted person and the adopted person's birth parents

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 259.41, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Study required before placement; certain relatives excepted. (a) An approved
adoption study; completed background study, as required under section 245C.33; and written report
must be completed before the child is placed in a prospective adoptive home under this chapter,
except as allowed by section 259.47, subdivision 6. In an agency placement, the report must be
filed with the court at the time the adoption petition is filed. In a direct adoptive placement, the
report must be filed with the court in support of a motion for temporary preadoptive custody under
section 259.47, subdivision 3, or, if the study and report are complete, in support of an emergency
order under section 259.47, subdivision 6. The study and report shall be completed by a licensed
child-placing agency and must be thorough and comprehensive. The study and report shall be
paid for by the prospective adoptive parent, except as otherwise required under section 256.01,
subdivision 2, paragraph (h), 259.67, or 259.73.

must be completed on the stepparent and any children as required under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), except that a child of the stepparent does not need to have a background study complete if they
are a sibling through birth or adoption of the person being adopted. The local social services agency
of the county in which the prospective adoptive parent lives must initiate a background study unless
a child-placing agency has been involved with the adoption. The local social service agency may
charge a reasonable fee for the background study. If a placement is being made the background
study must be completed prior to placement pursuant to section 259.29, subdivision 1, paragraph
(c). Background study results must be filed with the adoption petition according to section 259.22,
except in an adult adoption where an adoption study and background study are not needed.
    (c) In the case of a licensed foster parent seeking to adopt a child who is in the foster parent's
care, any portions of the foster care licensing process that duplicate requirements of the home study
may be submitted in satisfaction of the relevant requirements of this section.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.52, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

of search. No petition for adoption may be granted unless the agency supervising the adoptive
placement, the birth mother of the child, or, in the case of a stepparent or relative adoption, the
county agency responsible for the report required under section 259.53, subdivision 1, requests that
the commissioner of health search the registry to determine whether a putative father is registered
in relation to a child who is or may be the subject of an adoption petition. The search required by
this subdivision must be conducted no sooner than 31 days following the birth of the child. A search
of the registry may be proven by the production of a certified copy of the registration form or by
a certified statement of the commissioner of health that after a search no registration of a putative
father in relation to a child who is or may be the subject of an adoption petition could be located. The
filing of a certified copy of an order from a juvenile protection matter under chapter 260C containing
a finding that certification of the requisite search of the Minnesota Fathers' Adoption Registry was
filed with the court in that matter shall also constitute proof of search. Certification that the fathers'
adoption registry has been searched must be filed with the court prior to entry of any final order of
adoption. In addition to the search required by this subdivision, the agency supervising the adoptive
placement, the birth mother of the child, or, in the case of a stepparent or relative adoption, the

      t­ social services agency responsible for the report under section 259.53, subdivision 1, or the

    Subd. 3. Reports and records. (a) The contents of all reports and records of the commissioner
of human services, local social services agency, or child-placing agency bearing on the suitability
of the proposed adoptive home and the child to each other shall not be disclosed either directly
or indirectly to any person other than the commissioner of human services, the child's guardian

section 260C.317, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); or (2) section 259.65, or a judge of the court having
jurisdiction of the matter, except as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) A judge of the court having jurisdiction of the matter shall upon request disclose to a party
to the proceedings or the party's counsel any portion of a report or record that relates only to the
suitability of the proposed adoptive parents. In this disclosure, the judge may withhold the identity
of individuals providing information in the report or record. When the judge is considering whether

later than 30 days after a parent or parents are found and approved for adoptive placement of a
child certified as eligible for adoption assistance, and before the final decree of adoption is issued,
a written agreement must be entered into by the commissioner, the adoptive parent or parents, and
the placing agency. The written agreement must be fully completed by the placing agency and in
the form prescribed by the commissioner and must set forth the responsibilities of all parties, the
anticipated duration of the adoption assistance payments, and the payment terms. The adoption
assistance agreement shall be subject to the commissioner's approval, which must be granted or
denied not later than 15 days after the agreement is entered.

Commission's legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall
reference each relevant exemption provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes which
shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and
accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a description of the views
expressed and the record of a roll call vote. All documents considered in connection with an action
shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain
under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the Interstate Commission or by court order.
    4. The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be conducted by
telecommunication or other electronic communication.
   C. Officers and Staff
    1. The Interstate Commission may, through its executive committee, appoint or retain a staff
director for such period, upon such terms and conditions and for such compensation as the Interstate
Commission may deem appropriate. The staff director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate
Commission, but shall not have a vote. The staff director may hire and supervise such other staff as
may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.
   2. The Interstate Commission shall elect, from among its members, a chairperson and a vice

chairperson of the executive committee and other necessary officers, each of whom shall have such
authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws.
   D. Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification
    1. The Interstate Commission's staff director and its employees shall be immune from suit and
liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or
personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act,
error, or omission that occurred, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred
within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that such person
shall not be protected from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by a criminal
act or the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of such person.
    a. The liability of the Interstate Commission's staff director and employees or Interstate
Commission representatives, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties for
acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability
set forth under the Constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents.
The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of
any such action. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to protect such person from suit or
liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by a criminal act or the intentional or willful
and wanton misconduct of such person.
    b. The Interstate Commission shall defend the staff director and its employees and, subject to
the approval of the Attorney General or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state shall
defend the commissioner of a member state in a civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of
an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission
employment, duties or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing
occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful
and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.
    c. To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the Interstate Commission,
the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission shall be held harmless in the
amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney's fees and costs, obtained against such
persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope
of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a
reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment,
duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result
from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.

interpreted by the U. S. Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of

   1. Publish the proposed rule's entire text stating the reason(s) for that proposed rule; and

    E. Not later than 60 days after a rule is promulgated, an interested person may file a petition
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the
Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds
that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking
record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside.
    F. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, those states may by
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact cause that such
rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.
    G. The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of
Children superseded by this act shall be null and void no less than 12, but no more than 24 months

   10. Mediation, arbitration, and dispute resolution
   11. Education, training, and technical assistance

   13. Coordination with other interstate compacts
   I. Upon determination by a majority of the members of the Interstate Commission that an
emergency exists:
   1. The Interstate Commission may promulgate an emergency rule only if it is required to:
   a. Protect the children covered by this compact from an imminent threat to their health, safety,
and well-being; or
   b. Prevent loss of federal or state funds; or
   c. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule required by federal law.
    2. An emergency rule shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual

which the validity of a compact provision or rule is the issue for which a judicial determination
has been sought and shall have standing to intervene in any proceedings. Failure to provide service
of process to the Interstate Commission shall render any judgment, order or other determination,
however so captioned or classified, void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, its bylaws,
or rules of the Interstate Commission.
   B. Dispute Resolution
10614                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, its bylaws or rules, the Interstate
Commission may:
   a. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance; or

the United State District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate
Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal office, to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws, or rules. The relief sought
may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees; or
   d. Avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of official or
professional conduct.

state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff
which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as

     Subd. 2. Child in need of protection services. (a) The paramount consideration in all
proceedings concerning a child alleged or found to be in need of protection or services is the
health, safety, and best interests of the child. In proceedings involving an American Indian child,
as defined in section 260.755, subdivision 8, the best interests of the child must be determined
consistent with sections 260.751 to 260.835 and the Indian Child Welfare Act, United States Code,

the jurisdiction of the court, the care and guidance, preferably in the child's own home, as will best
serve the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the child;
    (2) to provide judicial procedures which protect the welfare of the child;
    (3) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, removing the child from the custody of parents only when the child's welfare or safety
cannot be adequately safeguarded without removal;
    (4) to ensure that when removal from the child's own family is necessary and in the child's best
interests, the responsible social services agency has legal responsibility for the child removal either:
    (i) pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement between the child's parent or guardian and the
responsible social services agency; or
    (ii) by court order pursuant to section 260C.151, subdivision 6; 206C.178; or 260C.201;
    (5) to ensure that, when placement is pursuant to court order, the court order removing the child
or continuing the child in foster care contains an individualized determination that placement is in
the best interests of the child that coincides with the actual removal of the child; and,
                                                                                        ­

basis for the petition under section 260C.007, subdivision 6, 260C.201, subdivision 11, or 260C.301.
    (1) In the case of a petition alleging the child to be in need of protection or services filed under
this paragraph, if all parties agree and the court finds it is in the best interests of the child, the court
may find the petition states a prima facie case that:
   (i) the child's needs are being met;
   (ii) the placement of the child in foster care is in the best interests of the child;
   (iii) reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the parent or guardian are being made; and
   (iv) the child will be returned home in the next three months.
    (2) If the court makes findings under paragraph (1), the court shall approve the voluntary
arrangement and continue the matter for up to three more months to ensure the child returns to the
parents' home. The responsible social services agency shall:
    (i) report to the court when the child returns home and the progress made by the parent on the
out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, in which case the court shall dismiss
jurisdiction;
    (ii) report to the court that the child has not returned home, in which case the matter shall be
returned to the court for further proceedings under section 260C.163; or
    (iii) if any party does not agree to continue the matter under this paragraph and paragraph (1),
the matter shall proceed under section 260C.163.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 260C.163, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260C.425, hearings on
any matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner. In all adjudicatory
proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services, the court shall admit
only evidence that would be admissible in a civil trial. To be proved at trial, allegations of a petition
alleging a child to be in need of protection or services must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.
     (b) Except for proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and
petitions for the termination of parental rights, hearings may be continued or adjourned from time
to time. In proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and petitions
for the termination of parental rights, hearings may not be continued or adjourned for more than
one week unless the court makes specific findings that the continuance or adjournment is in the best
interests of the child. If a hearing is held on a petition involving physical or sexual abuse of a child
who is alleged to be in need of protection or services or neglected and in foster care, the court shall
file the decision with the court administrator as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after the
matter is submitted to the court. When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding,
the court may make any interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance

      Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.178, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Hearing and release requirements. (a) If a child was taken into custody under
section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (a) or (b)(2), the court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours of
the time the child was taken into custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, to determine
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                          10623

whether the child should continue in custody.
    (b) Unless there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others, not return for
a court hearing, run away from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or otherwise not remain
in the care or control of the person to whose lawful custody the child is released, or that the child's
health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the child shall be released to the custody of
a parent, guardian, custodian, or other suitable person, subject to reasonable conditions of release
including, but not limited to, a requirement that the child undergo a chemical use assessment as
provided in section 260C.157, subdivision 1.
    (c) If the court determines there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others;
not return for a court hearing; run away from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or otherwise
not remain in the care or control of the person to whose lawful custody the child is released; or
that the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered if returned to the care of the
parent or guardian who has custody and from whom the child was removed, the court shall order
the child into foster care under the legal responsibility of the responsible social services agency or
responsible probation or corrections agency for the purposes of protective care as that term is used in
the juvenile court rules.­ or into the home of a noncustodial parent and order the noncustodial parent
to comply with any conditions the court determines to be appropriate to the safety and care of the
child, including cooperating with paternity establishment proceedings in the case of a man who has
not been adjudicated the child's father. The court shall not give the responsible social services legal
custody and order a trial home visit at any time prior to adjudication and disposition under section
260C.201, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (3), but may order the child returned to the care of
the parent or guardian who has custody and from whom the child was removed and order the parent
or guardian to comply with any conditions the court determines to be appropriate to meet the safety,
health, and welfare of the child.
   (d) In determining whether the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the
court shall consider whether the child would reside with a perpetrator of domestic child abuse.
    ­
    (­
     c­
      ) (e) The court, before determining whether a child should be placed in or continue in foster
care under the protective care of the responsible agency, shall also make a determination, consistent
with section 260.012 as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent placement or whether
reasonable efforts to prevent placement are not required. In the case of an Indian child, the court shall
determine whether active efforts, according to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States
Code, title 25, section 1912(d), were made to prevent placement. The court shall enter a finding that
the responsible social services agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement when the
agency establishes either:
   (1) that it has actually provided services or made efforts in an attempt to prevent the child's
removal but that such services or efforts have not proven sufficient to permit the child to safely
remain in the home; or
    (2) that there are no services or other efforts that could be made at the time of the hearing that
could safely permit the child to remain home or to return home. When reasonable efforts to prevent
placement are required and there are services or other efforts that could be ordered which would
permit the child to safely return home, the court shall order the child returned to the care of the
parent or guardian and the services or efforts put in place to ensure the child's safety. When the court
makes a prima facie determination that one of the circumstances under paragraph ­      (­
                                                                                        e­) (g) exists, the
10624                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [119TH DAY

court shall determine that reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to return the child to the care
of the parent or guardian are not required.
    If the court finds the social services agency's preventive or reunification efforts have not been
reasonable but further preventive or reunification efforts could not permit the child to safely remain
at home, the court may nevertheless authorize or continue the removal of the child.
  ­
  (d
   ­­) (f) The court may not order or continue the foster care placement of the child unless the court
makes explicit, individualized findings that continued custody of the child by the parent or guardian
would be contrary to the welfare of the child and that placement is in the best interest of the child.
   ­
   (­
    e­
     ) (g) At the emergency removal hearing, or at any time during the course of the proceeding,
and upon notice and request of the county attorney, the court shall determine whether a petition has
been filed stating a prima facie case that:
       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been involuntarily terminated;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
    (4) the parents' custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (e), clause (1), or a similar law of another
jurisdiction; or
    (5) the provision of services or further services for the purpose of reunification is futile and
therefore unreasonable.
   ­
   (­) (h) When a petition to terminate parental rights is required under section 260C.301,
    f­
subdivision 3 or 4, but the county attorney has determined not to proceed with a termination of
parental rights petition, and has instead filed a petition to transfer permanent legal and physical
custody to a relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, the court shall schedule a permanency
hearing within 30 days of the filing of the petition.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (i) If the county attorney has filed a petition under section 260C.307, the court shall schedule
a trial under section 260C.163 within 90 days of the filing of the petition except when the county
attorney determines that the criminal case shall proceed to trial first under section 260C.201,
subdivision 3.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (j) If the court determines the child should be ordered into foster care and the child's parent
refuses to give information to the responsible social services agency regarding the child's father
or relatives of the child, the court may order the parent to disclose the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, and other identifying information to the responsible social services agency for the purpose
of complying with the requirements of sections 260C.151, 260C.212, and 260C.215.
    ­
    (­)
     i­ (k) If a child ordered into foster care has siblings, whether full, half, or step, who are also
ordered into foster care, the court shall inquire of the responsible social services agency of the
efforts to place the children together as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 2, paragraph (d),
if placement together is in each child's best interests, unless a child is in placement due solely to the
119TH DAY]                                                  SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                                                           10625

child's own behavior or a child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent who is not parent to
all siblings. If the children are not placed together at the time of the hearing, the court shall inquire
at each subsequent hearing of the agency's efforts to place the siblings together. If any sibling is
not placed with another sibling or siblings, the agency must develop a plan for visitation among the
siblings as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1.

subdivision 4, and any member of the parent's household who is over the age of 13 when there is a
reasonable cause to believe that the parent or household member over age 13 has a criminal history
or a history of maltreatment of a child or vulnerable adult which would endanger the child's health,
safety, or welfare;
      (2) an individual whose suitability for relative placement under section 260C.212, subdivision

    (i) the relative must be licensed for foster care; or
    (ii) the background study is required under section 259.53, subdivision 2; or
    (iii) the agency or the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe the relative or household
member over the age of 13 has a criminal history which would not make transfer of permanent
legal and physical custody to the relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, in the child's best
interest; and
    (3) a parent, following an out-of-home placement, when the responsible social services agency
has reasonable cause to believe that the parent has been convicted of a crime directly related to
the parent's capacity to maintain the child's health, safety, or welfare or the parent is the subject
of an open investigation of, or has been the subject of a substantiated allegation of, child or
vulnerable-adult maltreatment within the past ten years.
"Reasonable cause" means that the agency has received information or a report from the subject or
a third person that creates an articulable suspicion that the individual has a history that may pose
a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the child. The information or report must be specific to
the potential subject of the background check and shall not be based on the race, religion, ethnic
background, age, class, or lifestyle of the potential subject.

subdivision to read:
119TH DAY]                                              SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                                                     10627

    Subd. 5. Assessment for emergency relative placement. The responsible social services
agency may obtain household members' criminal history and the history of maltreatment of a
child or adult and use the history to assess whether putting the child in the household would
endanger the child's health, safety, or welfare and to assess the suitability of a relative prior to
an emergency placement. This assessment does not substitute for the background study required
under chapter 245C and does not supersede requirements related to emergency placement under
section 245A.035.

foster care for treatment under chapter 260D, diagnostic and assessment information, specific
services relating to meeting the mental health care needs of the child, and treatment outcomes.
    (d) The parent or parents or guardian and the child each shall have the right to legal counsel in
the preparation of the case plan and shall be informed of the right at the time of placement of the
child. The child shall also have the right to a guardian ad litem. If unable to employ counsel from
their own resources, the court shall appoint counsel upon the request of the parent or parents or
the child or the child's legal guardian. The parent or parents may also receive assistance from any
person or social services agency in preparation of the case plan.
    After the plan has been agreed upon by the parties involved or approved or ordered by the court,
the foster parents shall be fully informed of the provisions of the case plan and shall be provided a
copy of the plan.
    Upon discharge from foster care, the parent, adoptive parent, or permanent legal and physical
custodian, as appropriate, and the child, if appropriate, must be provided with a current copy of the
child's health and education record.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 260C.212, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Responsible social service agency's duties for children in placement. (a) When a
            ­­a
child is in p l­­em

                      t foster care, the responsible social services agency shall make diligent efforts
to identify, locate, and, where appropriate, offer services to both parents of the child.
    (1) The responsible social services agency shall assess whether a noncustodial or nonadjudicated
parent is willing and capable of providing for the day-to-day care of the child temporarily or
permanently. An assessment under this clause may include, but is not limited to, obtaining
information under section 260C.209. If after assessment, the responsible social services agency
determines that a noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent is willing and capable of providing
day-to-day care of the child, the responsible social services agency may seek authority from the
custodial parent or the court to have that parent assume day-to-day care of the child. If a parent is
not an adjudicated parent, the responsible social services agency shall require the nonadjudicated
parent to cooperate with paternity establishment procedures as part of the case plan.
    (2) If, after assessment, the responsible social services agency determines that the child cannot

be in the day-to-day care of either parent, the agency shall:
   (i) prepare an out-of-home placement plan addressing the conditions that each parent must meet
before the child can be in that parent's day-to-day care; and
    (ii) provide a parent who is the subject of a background study under section 260C.209 15 days'
notice that it intends to use the study to recommend against putting the child with that parent, as
well as the notice provided in section 260C.209, subdivision 4, and the court shall afford the parent
an opportunity to be heard concerning the study.
    The results of a background study of a noncustodial parent shall not be used by the agency to
determine that the parent is incapable of providing day-to-day care of the child unless the agency
reasonably believes that placement of the child into the home of that parent would endanger the
child's health, safety, or welfare.
    (3) If, after the provision of services following an out-of-home placement plan under this section,
the child cannot return to the care of the parent from whom the child was removed or who had
legal custody at the time the child was placed in foster care, the agency may petition on behalf of a
noncustodial parent to establish legal custody with that parent under section 260C.201, subdivision
11. If paternity has not already been established, it may be established in the same proceeding in the
manner provided for under chapter 257.
    (4) The responsible social services agency may be relieved of the requirement to locate and
offer services to both parents by the juvenile court upon a finding of good cause after the filing of
a petition under section 260C.141.
     (b) The responsible social services agency shall give notice to the parent o                ­­

following information:
    (1) the parent and the child each has a right to separate legal counsel before signing a voluntary
placement agreement, but not to counsel appointed at public expense;
    (2) the parent is not required to agree to the voluntary placement, and a parent who enters a
voluntary placement agreement may at any time request that the agency return the child. If the parent
so requests, the child must be returned within 24 hours of the receipt of the request;
    (3) evidence gathered during the time the child is voluntarily placed may be used at a later time
as the basis for a petition alleging that the child is in need of protection or services or as the basis
for a petition seeking termination of parental rights or other permanent placement of the child away
from the parent;
    (4) if the responsible social services agency files a petition alleging that the child is in need of
protection or services or a petition seeking the termination of parental rights or other permanent
placement of the child away from the parent, the parent would have the right to appointment of
separate legal counsel and the child would have a right to the appointment of counsel and a guardian
ad litem as provided by law, and that counsel will be appointed at public expense if they are unable
to afford counsel; and
    (5) the timelines and procedures for review of voluntary placements under subdivision 3, and
the effect the time spent in voluntary placement on the scheduling of a permanent placement
determination hearing under section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
    (d) When an agency accepts a child for placement, the agency shall determine whether the child
has had a physical examination by or under the direction of a licensed physician within the 12 months
immediately preceding the date when the child came into the agency's care. If there is documentation
that the child has had an examination within the last 12 months, the agency is responsible for seeing
that the child has another physical examination within one year of the documented examination
and annually in subsequent years. If the agency determines that the child has not had a physical
examination within the 12 months immediately preceding placement, the agency shall ensure that
the child has an examination within 30 days of coming into the agency's care and once a year in
subsequent years.
    (e) Whether under state guardianship or not, if a child leaves foster care by reason of having
attained the age of majority under state law, the child must be given at no cost a copy of the child's

      (2) "visited on a monthly basis" is defined as at least one visit per calendar month;
    (3) "the child's caseworker" is defined as the person who has responsibility for managing the
child's foster care placement case as assigned by the responsible social service agency; and
    (4) "the child's residence" is defined as the home where the child is residing, and can include the
foster home, child care institution, or the home from which the child was removed if the child is on
a trial home visit.
   (b) Caseworker visits shall be of sufficient substance and duration to address issues pertinent to
case planning and service delivery to ensure the safety, permanency, and well-being of the child.

   Sec. 44. [260D.001] CHILD IN VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    (a) Sections 260D.001 to 260D.301, may be cited as the "child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" provisions of the Juvenile Court Act.
    (b) The juvenile court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment upon the filing of a report or petition required under this chapter. All obligations of
the agency to a child and family in foster care contained in chapter 260C not inconsistent with this
chapter are also obligations of the agency with regard to a child in foster care for treatment under
this chapter.
    (c) This chapter shall be construed consistently with the mission of the children's mental health
service system as set out in section 245.487, subdivision 3, and the duties of an agency under section
256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016, to meet the needs of a child with a
developmental disability or related condition. This chapter:
    (1) establishes voluntary foster care through a voluntary foster care agreement as the means for
an agency and a parent to provide needed treatment when the child must be in foster care to receive
necessary treatment for an emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition;
10636                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

    (2) establishes court review requirements for a child in voluntary foster care for treatment due
to emotional disturbance or developmental disability or a related condition;
    (3) establishes the ongoing responsibility of the parent as legal custodian to visit the child, to
plan together with the agency for the child's treatment needs, to be available and accessible to the
agency to make treatment decisions, and to obtain necessary medical, dental, and other care for the
child; and
    (4) applies to voluntary foster care when the child's parent and the agency agree that the child's
treatment needs require foster care either:
   (i) due to a level of care determination by the agency's screening team informed by the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
    (ii) due to a determination regarding the level of services needed by the responsible social
services' screening team under section 256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to
9525.0016.
    (d) This chapter does not apply when there is a current determination under section 626.556 that
the child requires child protective services or when the child is in foster care for any reason other
than treatment for the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition.
When there is a determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services
based on an assessment that there are safety and risk issues for the child that have not been mitigated
through the parent's engagement in services or otherwise, or when the child is in foster care for any
reason other than the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition,
the provisions of chapter 260C apply.
    (e) The paramount consideration in all proceedings concerning a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment is the safety, health, and the best interests of the child. The purpose of this chapter is:
   (1) to ensure a child with a disability is provided the services necessary to treat or ameliorate the
symptoms of the child's disability;
    (2) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, approving the child's placement away from the child's parents only when the child's need
for care or treatment requires it and the child cannot be maintained in the home of the parent; and
    (3) to ensure the child's parent retains legal custody of the child and associated decision-making
authority unless the child's parent willfully fails or is unable to make decisions that meet the child's
safety, health, and best interests. The court may not find that the parent willfully fails or is unable
to make decisions that meet the child's needs solely because the parent disagrees with the agency's
choice of foster care facility, unless the agency files a petition under chapter 260C, and establishes
by clear and convincing evidence that the child is in need of protection or services.
    (f) The legal parent-child relationship shall be supported under this chapter by maintaining the
parent's legal authority and responsibility for ongoing planning for the child and by the agency's
assisting the parent, where necessary, to exercise the parent's ongoing right and obligation to visit
or to have reasonable contact with the child. Ongoing planning means:
   (1) actively participating in the planning and provision of educational services, medical, and
dental care for the child;

    (2) actively planning and participating with the agency and the foster care facility for the child's
treatment needs; and
    (3) planning to meet the child's need for safety, stability, and permanency, and the child's need
to stay connected to the child's family and community.
     (g) The provisions of section 260.012 to ensure placement prevention, family reunification, and
all active and reasonable effort requirements of that section apply. This chapter shall be construed
consistently with the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code,
title 25, section 1901, et. al., and the provisions of the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act,
sections 260.751 to 260.835.

treatment" means a child who is emotionally disturbed or developmentally disabled or has a related
condition and is in foster care under a voluntary foster care agreement between the child's parent
and the agency due to concurrence between the agency and the parent that the child's level of care
requires placement in foster care either:
   (1) due to a determination by the agency's screening team based on its review of the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
   (2) due to a determination by the agency's screening team under section 256B.092 and Minnesota

related condition.
    Subd. 6. Compelling reasons. "Compelling reasons" has the same meaning given in section
260C.007, subdivision 8. The agency may determine compelling reasons when the child is in foster

    Subdivision 1. Voluntary foster care. When the agency's screening team, based upon
the diagnostic and functional assessment under section 245.4885 or 256B.092, subdivision 7,
determines the child's need for treatment due to emotional disturbance or developmental disability
or related condition requires foster care placement of the child, a voluntary foster care agreement
between the child's parent and the agency gives the agency legal authority to place the child in
foster care.

     (f) Unless requested by a parent, representative of the foster care facility, or the child, no in-court
hearing is required in order for the court to make findings and issue an order as required in paragraph

    (g) If the court finds the voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests
and that the agency and parent are appropriately planning for the child, the court shall issue an

The court may make this determination notwithstanding the child's disagreement, if any, reported

notify the agency, the parent, the foster parent or foster care facility, the child, age 12 or older, and
the county attorney of the court's determinations and the basis for the court's determinations. In this
case, the court shall set the matter for hearing and appoint a guardian ad litem for the child under
section 260C.163, subdivision 5.
   Sec. 50. [260D.107] REQUIRED PERMANENCY REVIEW HEARING.
    (a) When the court has found that the voluntary arrangement is in the child's best interests and that
the agency and parent are appropriately planning for the child pursuant to the report submitted under

    (5) the date of the court finding that the foster care placement was in the best interests of the
child, if required under section 260D.105, or the date the agency filed the motion under section
260D.201, paragraph (b);
    (6) the agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the child, including returning

   (7) a citation to this chapter as the basis for the petition.
   (d) An updated copy of the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212,
subdivision 1, shall be filed with the petition.
    (e) The court shall set the date for the permanency review hearing no later than 14 months after
the child has been in placement or within 30 days of the petition filing date when the child has been
in placement 15 of the last 22 months. The court shall serve the petition together with a notice of
hearing by United States mail on the parent, the child age 12 or older, the child's guardian ad litem,
if one has been appointed, the agency, the county attorney, and counsel for any party.
    (f) The court shall conduct the permanency review hearing on the petition no later than 14 months
after the date of the voluntary placement agreement, within 30 days of the filing of the petition when
the child has been in placement 15 days of the last 22 months, or within 15 days of a motion to
terminate jurisdiction and to dismiss an order for foster care under chapter 260C, as provided in

   (g) At the permanency review hearing, the court shall:
   (1) inquire of the parent if the parent has reviewed the "Petition for Permanency Review
Regarding a Child in Voluntary Foster Care for Treatment," whether the petition is accurate, and
whether the parent agrees to the continued voluntary foster care arrangement as being in the child's
best interests;
    (2) inquire of the parent if the parent is satisfied with the agency's reasonable efforts to finalize
the permanent plan for the child, including whether there are services available and accessible to
the parent that might allow the child to safely be with the child's family;
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                      10643

   (3) inquire of the parent if the parent consents to the court entering an order that:
    (i) approves the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the
child, which includes ongoing future planning for the safety, health, and best interests of the child;
and
   (ii) approves the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling reasons why the
continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests; and
   (4) inquire of the child's guardian ad litem and any other party whether the guardian or the party
agrees that:
    (i) the court should approve the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent
plan for the child, which includes ongoing and future planning for the safety, health, and best
interests of the child; and
    (ii) the court should approve of the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling
reasons why the continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests.
   (h) At a permanency review hearing under this section, the court may take the following actions
based on the contents of the sworn petition and the consent of the parent:
   (1) approve the agency's compelling reasons that the voluntary foster care arrangement is in the
best interests of the child; and
    (2) find that the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize a plan for the permanent plan for
the child.
    (i) A child, age 12 or older, may object to the agency's request that the court approve its
compelling reasons for the continued voluntary arrangement and may be heard on the reasons
for the objection. Notwithstanding the child's objection, the court may approve the agency's
compelling reasons and the voluntary arrangement.
    (j) If the court does not approve the voluntary arrangement after hearing from the child or the
child's guardian ad litem, the court shall dismiss the petition. In this case, either:
   (1) the child must be returned to the care of the parent; or
    (2) the agency must file a petition under section 260C.141, asking for appropriate relief under
section 260C.201, subdivision 11, or 260C.301.
    (k) When the court approves the agency's compelling reasons for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, and finds that the agency has made reasonable efforts to
finalize a permanent plan for the child, the court shall approve the continued voluntary foster care
arrangement, and continue the matter under the court's jurisdiction for the purposes of reviewing
the child's placement every 12 months while the child is in foster care.
   (l) A finding that the court approves the continued voluntary placement means the agency has
continued legal authority to place the child while a voluntary placement agreement remains in effect.
The parent or the agency may terminate a voluntary agreement as provided in section 260D.301.
Termination of a voluntary foster care placement of an Indian child is governed by section 260.765,
subdivision 4.

   (a) After the court conducts a permanency review hearing under section 260D.107, the matter
must be returned to the court for further review of the child's foster care placement at least every

12 or older, and the foster parents of the continued review requirements under this section at the
permanency review hearing.
    (b) Every 12 months, the court shall determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to
finalize the permanency plan for the child, which means the exercise of due diligence by the agency
to:
    (1) ensure that the agreement for voluntary foster care is the most appropriate legal arrangement
to meet the child's safety, health, and best interests;
    (2) engage and support the parent in continued involvement in planning and decision making
for the needs of the child;
   (3) strengthen the child's ties to the parent, relatives, and community;
   (4) implement the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1,
and ensure that the plan requires the provision of appropriate services to address the physical health,
mental health, and educational needs of the child; and
    (5) ensure appropriate planning for the child's safe, permanent, and independent living
arrangement after the child's 18th birthday.
  Sec. 52. [260D.201] PERMANENCY REVIEW AFTER ADJUDICATION UNDER
CHAPTER 260C.
    (a) If a child has been ordered into foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision
1, and the conditions that led to the court's order have been corrected so that the child could safely
return home except for the child's need to continue in foster care for treatment due to the child's
disability, the child's parent and the agency may enter into a voluntary foster care agreement under
this chapter using the procedure set out in paragraph (b).
   (b) When the agency and the parent agree to enter into a voluntary foster care agreement
under this chapter, the agency must file a motion to terminate jurisdiction under section 260C.193,
subdivision 6, and to dismiss the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1, together with the petition required under section 260D.107, paragraph (b), for
permanency review and the court's approval of the voluntary arrangement.
    (c) The court shall send the motion and the petition filed under subdivision 2 together with a
notice of hearing by mail as required in section 260D.107, paragraph (e).
    (d) The petition and motion under this section must be filed no later than the time the agency is
required to file a petition for permanent placement under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, but may
be filed as soon as the agency and the parent agree that the child should remain in foster care under
a voluntary foster care agreement, because the child needs treatment and voluntary foster care is in
the child's best interest.
   (e) In order for the agency to have continuous legal authority to place the child, the parent and the
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                       10645

agency must execute a voluntary foster care agreement for the child's continuation in foster care for
treatment prior to the termination of the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1. The parent and agency may execute the voluntary foster care agreement at or before
the permanency review hearing required under this section. The voluntary foster care agreement
shall not be effective until the court terminates jurisdiction under section 260C.193, subdivision 6,
and dismisses the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision 1. Unless
the agency and the parent execute a voluntary placement agreement for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, the agency shall not have legal authority to place the child after
the court terminates jurisdiction under chapter 260C.
   Sec. 53. [260D.301] TERMINATION OF VOLUNTARY PLACEMENT AGREEMENT.
    (a) The child's parent may terminate a voluntary placement agreement under this chapter upon

planning under paragraph (e). Written notice by the agency shall be considered received by the
parent three business days after mailing by the agency.
    (c) Upon receipt of notice of the termination of the voluntary foster care agreement, the agency,
the parent, and the facility may agree to a time that the child shall return home. The scheduled time

the lowest possible lifetime cost for new buildings and major renovations, and allow for changes
in the guidelines that encourage continual energy conservation improvements in new buildings and
major renovations. The guidelines shall define "major renovations" for purposes of this section.

guidelines that include air quality and lighting standards and that create and maintain a healthy
environment and facilitate productivity improvements; specify ways to reduce material costs; and
must consider the long-term operating costs of the building, including the use of renewable energy
sources and distributed electric energy generation that uses a renewable source or natural gas or a
fuel that is as clean or cleaner than natural gas.
   Subd. 3. Development of guidelines; applicability. In developing the guidelines, the
departments shall use an open process, including providing the opportunity for public comment.
The guidelines established under this section are mandatory for all new buildings receiving funding

                    EXECUTIVE AND OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS

    The following communications were received.
                                                                                    May 18, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 960, Chapter 342, a bill modifying the definition of
"dependents" for purposes of group benefits for local government officers and employees.
The provisions in this bill would permit unlimited expansion of employment benefits to domestic
partners and others by local units of government. I vetoed nearly identical language last year, and
my position has not changed.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 960 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning S.F. 2605, Chapter 339, a bill that will stagger the terms for
appointments to the Met Council.
Appointed members of the Met Council serve at the will of the governor and the terms of the council
members end with the term of the governor. This structure was the result of reforms intended to
increase Met Council accountability, and this bill reduces that accountability.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2605 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 121A.19, is amended to read:
   121A.19 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AID.
    Each school year, the state must pay a district for each child or student screened by the district
according to the requirements of section 121A.17. The amount of state aid for each child or student
screened shall be: (1) ­ $5
                          ­0­ $75 for a child screened at age three; (2) ­
                                                                         $4
                                                                          ­0­ $50 for a child screened at
age four; (3) ­$3
                ­0­ $40 for a child screened at age five or six prior to kindergarten; and (4) $30 for a
student screened within 30 days after first enrolling in a public school kindergarten if the student has
not previously been screened according to the requirements of section 121A.17. If this amount of
aid is insufficient, the district may permanently transfer from the general fund an amount that, when
added to the aid, is sufficient. Developmental screening aid shall not be paid for any student who is
screened more than 30 days after the first day of attendance at a public school kindergarten, except
if a student transfers to another public school kindergarten within 30 days after first enrolling in a
Minnesota public school kindergarten program. In this case, if the student has not been screened,
the district to which the student transfers may receive developmental screening aid for screening
that student when the screening is performed within 30 days of the transfer date.

used only to make capital improvements including:
    (1) under section 126C.10, subdivision 14, total operating capital revenue uses specified in

projects, the amount of the bond issue, and the total amount of district indebtedness.
     (c) A bond issue tentatively authorized by the board under this subdivision becomes finally
authorized unless a petition signed by more than 15 percent of the registered voters of the district
is filed with the school board within 30 days of the board's adoption of a resolution stating the
board's intention to issue bonds. The percentage is to be determined with reference to the number of
registered voters in the district on the last day before the petition is filed with the board. The petition
must call for a referendum on the question of whether to issue the bonds for the projects under this
section. The approval of 50 percent plus one of those voting on the question is required to pass a
referendum authorized by this section.
    (d) The bonds must be paid off within ­et­n

of the tax levies under this section and section 123B.61 for each year must not exceed the limit
specified in section 123B.61. The levy for each year must be reduced as provided in section 123B.61.
A district using an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the bonds shall report the
amount used for this purpose to the commissioner by July 15 of the following fiscal year. A district
having an outstanding capital loan under section 126C.69 or an outstanding debt service loan under
section 126C.68 must not use an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the bonds.
   (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), bonds issued by a district within the first five years following
voter approval of a combination according to section 123A.37, subdivision 2, must be paid off within
20 years of issuance. All the other provisions and limitation of paragraph (d) apply.
     Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Pupils in adjoining states. Except as provided under an agreement with an adjoining
state under section 124D.041, a non-Minnesota pupil who resides in an adjoining state in a district
that borders Minnesota may enroll in a Minnesota district if either the board of the district in which
the pupil resides or state in which the pupil resides pays tuition to the district in which the pupil is
enrolled.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.04, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Tuition payments. (a) In each odd-numbered year, before March 1, the commissioner
must agree to rates of tuition for Minnesota elementary and secondary pupils attending in other states
for the next two fiscal years when the other state agrees to negotiate tuition rates. The commissioner
must negotiate equal, reciprocal rates with the designated authority in each state for pupils who
reside in an adjoining state and enroll in a Minnesota district. The rates must be at least equal to the
tuition specified in section 124D.05, subdivision 1. If the other state does not agree to negotiate a
general tuition rate, a Minnesota school district may negotiate a tuition rate with the school district
in the other state that sends a pupil to or receives a pupil from the Minnesota school district. The
tuition rate for a pupil with a disability must be equal to the actual cost of instruction and services
provided. The resident district of a Minnesota pupil attending in another state under this section
must pay the amount of tuition agreed upon in this section to the district of attendance, prorated on
the basis of the proportion of the school year attended.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subdivision 9, if an agreement is reached between the
state of Minnesota and an adjoining state pursuant to section 124D.041, the provisions of section
124D.041 and the agreement shall apply to all enrollment transfers between Minnesota and the
adjoining state, and provisions of paragraph (a) and subdivision 9 shall not apply.

    (b) If an agreement is reached between the state of Minnesota and an adjoining state pursuant
to section 124D.041 that requires a special education tuition payment from an adjoining state to the
state of Minnesota, the special education aid appropriation for that year and the state total special
education aid under subdivision 4 shall be increased by the amount of the payment.
    (c) If an agreement is reached between the state of Minnesota and an adjoining state pursuant
to section 124D.041 that requires special education tuition payments to be made between the two
states and not between districts in the two states, the special education aid for a Minnesota school
district serving a student with a disability from the adjoining state shall be calculated according to
section 127A.47, subdivision 7, except that no reduction shall be made in the special education aid
paid to the resident district.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.10, subdivision 31, is amended to read:

pupil units for fiscal year 2004, times the difference between: (1) the lesser of the district's general
education revenue per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit for fiscal year 2003 or the amount of general
education revenue the district would have received per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit for fiscal
year 2004 according to Minnesota Statutes 2002, and (2) the district's general education revenue for

enrolled under section 124D.041 for the first year the agreement is in effect if the agreement had
not been in effect, and the sum of the district's general education revenue and net tuition revenue
for the first year the agreement is in effect.

for the purpose. The referendum may be called by the board or shall be called by the board upon
written petition of qualified voters of the district. The referendum must be conducted one or two
calendar years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one
election to approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted
by mail under paragraph (g), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue per resident
marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board, of increased
revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the number of years
for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall increase annually
by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual inflationary increase
calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing referendum levy
authority is expiring. In this case, the ballot may also compare the proposed levy authority to the
existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount, if any, over the
expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number of years, not to
exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a ballot on the
question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must abbreviate
the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under section
275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies at the same amount per pupil
as in the previous year:

revenue amount must state the amount per resident marginal cost pupil unit by which the authority
is to be reduced. Revenue authority approved by the voters of the district pursuant to paragraph
(a) must be available to the school district at least once before it is subject to a referendum on its
revocation or reduction for subsequent years. Only one revocation or reduction referendum may be
held to revoke or reduce referendum revenue for any specific year and for years thereafter.
     (d) A petition authorized by paragraph (a) or (c) is effective if signed by a number of qualified
voters in excess of 15 percent of the registered voters of the district on the day the petition is filed
with the board. A referendum invoked by petition must be held on the date specified in paragraph
(a).
    (e) The approval of 50 percent plus one of those voting on the question is required to pass a
referendum authorized by this subdivision.
    (f) At least 15 days before the day of the referendum, the district must submit a copy of the notice

   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the

in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
   (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $

times the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed ­$2­5­ $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.

   126C.44 SAFE SCHOOLS LEVY.
    (a) Each district may make a levy on all taxable property located within the district for the
purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the
following purposes: (1) to pay the costs incurred for the salaries, benefits, and transportation costs
of peace officers and sheriffs for liaison in services in the district's schools; (2) to pay the costs for
a drug abuse prevention program as defined in section 609.101, subdivision 3, paragraph (e), in the
elementary schools; (3) to pay the costs for a gang resistance education training curriculum in the
district's schools; (4) to pay the costs for security in the district's schools and on school property;
(5) to pay the costs for other crime prevention, drug abuse, student and staff safety, voluntary opt-in
suicide prevention tools, and violence prevention measures taken by the school district; or (6) to pay
costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.

     Subd. 3. School district bound; interest rate on state paid amount. If, at the request of a
school district or intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest
due on a district's debt obligation on a specific date, the school district or intermediate school district
is bound by all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the
date paid until the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner
of finance. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4 and other payments received from the district.
    Subd. 4. Pledge of district's full faith and credit. If, at the request of a school district or
intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on a district's
debt obligation on a specific date, the pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers
of the school district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay the principal and
interest due on those debt obligations shall also, without an election or the requirement of a further
authorization, become a pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers of the school
district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay to the state the amount paid, with
interest. Amounts paid by the state must be repaid in the order in which the state payments were
made.
    Subd. 4a. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the state
must reduce the state aid payable to the school district or intermediate school district under this
chapter and chapters 122A, 123A, 123B, 124D, 125A, 126C, and 273 by the amount paid by the
state under this section on behalf of the district, plus the interest due on it, and the amount reduced
must revert from the appropriate account to the state general fund. Payments from the school district
endowment fund or any federal aid payments shall not be reduced.
    (b) For an intermediate school district, the state aid payable to the intermediate school district
must first be reduced, before any reduction is made to the state aids payable to the member districts.
If the state aid payable to the intermediate school district is not sufficient to repay the state, state
aid payable to member districts may be reduced proportionately based on the ratio of each member
district's adjusted net tax capacity to the total adjusted net tax capacity of all member districts.
    (c) If, after review of the financial situation of the school district or intermediate school
district, the commissioner advises the commissioner of finance that a total reduction of aids would
cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the district, the
commissioner, with the approval of the commissioner of finance, may establish a different schedule
for reduction of aids to repay the state. The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any
amounts repaid to the state by the district from other revenue sources.
   Subd. 6. Tax levy for repayment. (a) With the approval of the commissioner, a district may
levy in the year the state makes a payment under this section an amount up to the amount necessary
10684                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [119TH DAY

to provide funds for the repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the district. The proceeds of this levy may be used only for this purpose
unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess shall be used to repay
other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the debt redemption fund of the
school district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the district for purposes of section
275.065, subdivision 6. The amount of aids to be reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by
the amount levied. This levy by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section
123B.53.
    (b) If the state is not repaid in full for a payment made under this section by November 30
of the calendar year following the year in which the state makes the payment, the commissioner
shall require the district to certify a property tax levy in an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the school district. To prevent undue hardship, the commissioner may allow
the district to certify the levy over a five-year period. The proceeds of the levy may be used only
for this purpose unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess
shall be used to repay other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the
debt redemption fund of the district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the school
district for purposes of section 275.065, subdivision 6. If the commissioner orders the district to
levy, the amount of aids reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by the amount levied. This levy
by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section 123B.53 or any successor
provision. A levy under this subdivision must be explained as a specific increase at the meeting
required under section 275.065, subdivision 6.
    (c) For an intermediate district, a levy made by a member district under paragraph (a) or (b) to
pay its pro rata share must be spread by the commissioner as a tax rate based on the total adjusted
net tax capacity of the member school districts. The proceeds of the levy must be remitted by the
member school district to the intermediate school district and must be used by the intermediate
district only to repay the state amounts owed. Any amount in excess of the amount owed to the
state must be repaid to the member school districts and the commissioner shall adjust each member
district's property tax levy in the next year.
    Subd. 7. Election as to mandatory application. A school district or intermediate school district
may covenant and obligate itself, prior to the issuance of an issue of debt obligations, to notify the
commissioner of a potential default and to use the provisions of this section to guarantee payment
of the principal and interest on those debt obligations when due. If the district obligates itself to
be bound by this section, it must covenant in the resolution that authorizes the issuance of the debt
obligations to deposit with the paying agent three business days prior to the date on which a payment
is due an amount sufficient to make that payment or to notify the commissioner under subdivision 1
that it will be unable to make all or a portion of that payment. A district that has obligated itself must
include a provision in its agreement with the paying agent for that issue that requires the paying agent
to inform the commissioner if it becomes aware of a potential default in the payment of principal
or interest on that issue or if, on the day two business days prior to the date a payment is due on
that issue, there are insufficient funds to make the payment on deposit with the paying agent. Funds
invested in a refunding escrow account established under section 475.67 that are to become available
to the paying agent on a principal or interest payment date are deemed to be on deposit with the
paying agent three business days before the payment date. If a district either covenants to be bound
by this section or accepts state payments under this section to prevent a default of a particular issue
119TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                         10685

of debt obligations, the provisions of this section shall be binding as to that issue as long as any debt
obligation of that issue remain outstanding. If the provisions of this section are or become binding
for more than one issue of debt obligations and a district is unable to make payments on one or more
of those issues, the district must continue to make payments on the remaining issues.
    Subd. 8. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the state makes payments on behalf of a
school district or intermediate school district under this section or the district defaults in the payment
of principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to the commissioner
for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to resolve the issues which led to its
inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The department must provide technical
assistance to the district in preparing its plan. If the commissioner determines that a district's plan
is not adequate, the commissioner shall notify the district that the plan has been disapproved, the
reasons for the disapproval, and that the state shall not make future payments under this section
for debt obligations issued after the date specified in that notice until its plan is approved. The
commissioner may also notify the district that until its plan is approved, other aids due the district
will be withheld after a date specified in the notice.
    Subd. 9. State bond rating. If the commissioner of finance determines that the credit rating of
the state would be adversely affected thereby, the commissioner of finance shall not issue warrants
under subdivision 2 for the payment of principal or interest on any debt obligations for which a
district did not, prior to their issuance, obligate itself to be bound by the provisions of this section.
    Subd. 10. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of finance may enter into
written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information needed to
facilitate the ability of school districts or intermediate school districts to issue debt obligations
according to federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, including securities and exchange
commission rules and regulations, section 240.15c2-12. Such agreements or contracts may be in
any form the commissioner of finance deems reasonable and in the state's best interests.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 127A.45, subdivision 16, is amended to read:
   Subd. 16. Payments to third parties. Notwithstanding subdivision 3, the current year aid
payment percentage of the amounts under section 123A.26, subdivision 3 and section 124D.041,
shall be paid in equal installments on August 30, December 30, and March 30, with a final
adjustment payment on October 30 of the next fiscal year of the remaining amount.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 127A.49, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Abatements. Whenever by virtue of chapter 278, sections 270C.86, 375.192, or
otherwise, the net tax capacity or referendum market value of any district for any taxable year is
changed after the taxes for that year have been spread by the county auditor and the local tax rate
as determined by the county auditor based upon the original net tax capacity is applied upon the
changed net tax capacities, the county auditor shall, prior to February 1 of each year, certify to
the commissioner of education the amount of any resulting net revenue loss that accrued to the
district during the preceding year. Each year, the commissioner shall pay an abatement adjustment
to the district in an amount calculated according to the provisions of this subdivision. This amount
shall be deducted from the amount of the levy authorized by section 126C.46. The amount of the
10686                                         JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                 [119TH DAY

abatement adjustment must be the product of:
     (1) the net revenue loss as certified by the county auditor, times
     (2) the ratio of:
    (i) the sum of the amounts of the district's certified levy in the third preceding year according to
the following:
    (A) section 123B.57, if the district received health and safety aid according to that section for
the second preceding year;
    (B) section 124D.20, if the district received aid for community education programs according
to that section for the second preceding year;
    (C) section 124D.135, subdivision 3, if the district received early childhood family education
aid according to section 124D.135 for the second preceding year;
    (D) section 126C.17, subdivision 6, if the district received referendum equalization aid according
to that section for the second preceding year;

   (2) the amount subtracted from aid pursuant to clause (a).
    If the aid and levy reductions required by this subdivision cannot be made to the aid for the fiscal
year specified or to the levy specified, the reductions must be made from aid for subsequent fiscal
years, and from subsequent levies. The school district must use the payment of excess tax increment
to replace the aid and levy revenue reduced under this subdivision.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to the total amount of excess increments received by a district
for a calendar year that exceeds $25,000.

read:
    Subd. 7a. Surplus appropriation. If the amount appropriated is determined by the office to be
more than sufficient to fund projected grant demand in the second year of the biennium, the office
may increase the living and miscellaneous expense allowance in the second year of the biennium
by up to an amount that retains sufficient appropriations to fund the projected grant demand. The
adjustment may be made one or more times. In making the determination that there are more than
sufficient funds, the office shall balance the need for sufficient resources to meet the projected
demand for grants with the goal of fully allocating the appropriation for state grants. An increase in
the living and miscellaneous expense allowance under this subdivision does not carry forward into
a subsequent biennium. T  ­h

in 2012 and must include an analysis of
the economic and environmental costs and
benefits of reaching that goal; and
(3) a report to be submitted by January 1,
2009, to the chairs and ranking minority
members of the senate and house committees
with primary jurisdiction over solid waste
policy, that recommends options for
achieving the following goals by 2020:
an increase in county recycling rates to
60 percent of the weight of total solid
waste generation; and the diversion, prior
to delivery to landfills and waste-to-energy
plants, and recycling and reuse of an amount
of source-separated compostable materials
equal to 15 percent of total solid waste
generation. The commissioner must obtain

  Sec. 12. [94.3495] EXPEDITED EXCHANGES OF LAND INVOLVING THE STATE
AND GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose and scope. (a) The purpose of this section is to expedite the exchange
of public land ownership. Consolidation of public land reduces management costs and aids in the
reduction of forest fragmentation.
    (b) This section applies to exchanges of land between the state and a governmental subdivision
of the state. For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.
   Subd. 2. Classes of land; definitions. The classes of public land that may be involved in an
expedited exchange under this section are:
   (1) Class 1 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class A land as defined in section
94.342, subdivision 1, except for:
   (i) school trust land as defined in section 92.025; and
   (ii) university land granted to the state by acts of Congress;
   (2) Class 2 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class B land as defined in section 94.342,
subdivision 2; and
   (3) Class 3 land, which for the purpose of this section is all land owned in fee by a governmental
subdivision of the state.
     Subd. 3. Valuation of land. (a) In an exchange of Class 1 land for Class 2 or 3 land, the value of
all the land shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources. In an exchange of Class 2
land for Class 3 land, the value of all the land shall be determined by the county board of the county
in which the land lies. To determine the value of the land, the parties to the exchange may cause the
land to be appraised, utilize the valuation process provided under section 84.0272, subdivision 3,
or obtain a market analysis from a qualified real estate broker. Merchantable timber value must be
determined and considered in finalizing valuation of the lands.
     (b) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
utilize title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. All expedited land exchanges under this
section, and the terms and conditions of the exchanges, require the unanimous approval of the
Land Exchange Board.
    Subd. 6. Conveyance. (a) Conveyance of Class 1 land given in exchange shall be made by deed
executed by the commissioner of natural resources in the name of the state. Conveyance of Class
2 land given in exchange shall be by a deed executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name
of the state. Conveyance of Class 3 land shall be by a deed executed by the governing body in the

name of the governing authority.
   (b) If Class 1 land is given in exchange for Class 2 or 3 land, the deed to the Class 2 or 3 land
shall first be delivered to the commissioner of natural resources. Following the recording of the
deed, the commissioner of natural resources shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 1 land.
    (c) If Class 2 land is given in exchange for Class 3 land, the deed to the Class 3 land shall first be

   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116.07, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Rules and standards. Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the
provisions hereof, the Pollution Control Agency may adopt, amend and rescind rules and standards
having the force of law relating to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1967, chapter 882, for
the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general
application throughout the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances, or conditions
in order to make due allowance for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may
relate to sources or emissions of air contamination or air pollution, to the quality or composition of
such emissions, or to the quality of or composition of the ambient air or outdoor atmosphere or to
any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution.
     Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions hereof, the Pollution
Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1969, chapter 1046, for the collection, transportation,
storage, processing, and disposal of solid waste and the prevention, abatement, or control of water,
air, and land pollution which may be related thereto, and the deposit in or on land of any other
material that may tend to cause pollution. The agency shall adopt such rules and standards for
sewage sludge, addressing the intrinsic suitability of land, the volume and rate of application of
sewage sludge of various degrees of intrinsic hazard, design of facilities, and operation of facilities
and sites. Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or may
be limited as to times, places, circumstances, or conditions in order to make due allowance for
variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to collection, transportation,
processing, disposal, equipment, location, procedures, methods, systems or techniques or to any
other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement or control of water, air, and land pollution
which may be advised through the control of collection, transportation, processing, and disposal
of solid waste and sewage sludge, and the deposit in or on land of any other material that may
tend to cause pollution. By January 1, 1983, the rules for the management of sewage sludge shall
include an analysis of the sewage sludge determined by the commissioner of agriculture to be
necessary to meet the soil amendment labeling requirements of section 18C.215. The rules for the
disposal of solid waste shall include site-specific criteria to prohibit solid waste disposal based on
the area's sensitivity to groundwater contamination, including site-specific testing. The rules shall
also include modifications to financial assurance requirements under subdivision 4h that ensure
the state is protected from financial responsibility for future groundwater contamination. Until the
rules are modified to include site-specific criteria to prohibit areas from solid waste disposal due to
groundwater contamination sensitivity, as required under this section, the agency shall not issue a
permit for a new solid waste disposal facility, except for:
   (1) the reissuance of a permit for a land disposal facility operating as of March 1, 2008;
    (2) a permit to expand a land disposal facility operating as of March 1, 2008, beyond its permitted
boundaries, including expansion on land that is not contiguous to, but is located within 600 yards
of, the land disposal facility's permitted boundaries;
    (3) a permit to modify the type of waste accepted at a land disposal facility operating as of March
1, 2008;
   (4) a permit to locate a disposal facility that accepts only construction debris as defined in section
115A.03, subdivision 7;

Minnesota Rules, chapter 6132.
    Pursuant and subject to the provisions of chapter 14, and the provisions hereof, the Pollution
Control Agency may adopt, amend and rescind rules and standards having the force of law relating
to any purpose within the provisions of Laws 1971, chapter 727, for the prevention, abatement,
or control of noise pollution. Any such rule or standard may be of general application throughout
the state, or may be limited as to times, places, circumstances or conditions in order to make due
allowances for variations therein. Without limitation, rules or standards may relate to sources
or emissions of noise or noise pollution, to the quality or composition of noises in the natural
environment, or to any other matter relevant to the prevention, abatement, or control of noise
pollution.
   As to any matters subject to this chapter, local units of government may set emission regulations
with respect to stationary sources which are more stringent than those set by the Pollution Control
Agency.
    Pursuant to chapter 14, the Pollution Control Agency may adopt, amend, and rescind rules and
standards having the force of law relating to any purpose within the provisions of this chapter
for generators of hazardous waste, the management, identification, labeling, classification, storage,
collection, treatment, transportation, processing, and disposal of hazardous waste and the location of
hazardous waste facilities. A rule or standard may be of general application throughout the state or
may be limited as to time, places, circumstances, or conditions. In implementing its hazardous waste
rules, the Pollution Control Agency shall give high priority to providing planning and technical
assistance to hazardous waste generators. The agency shall assist generators in investigating the
availability and feasibility of both interim and long-term hazardous waste management methods.
The methods shall include waste reduction, waste separation, waste processing, resource recovery,
and temporary storage.
   The Pollution Control Agency shall give highest priority in the consideration of permits to
authorize disposal of diseased shade trees by open burning at designated sites to evidence concerning
economic costs of transportation and disposal of diseased shade trees by alternative methods.

favorable market conditions.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 41A.09, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Ethanol producer payments. (a) The commissioner shall make cash payments
to producers of ethanol located in the state that have begun production at a specific location by
June 30, 2000. For the purpose of this subdivision, an entity that holds a controlling interest in
more than one ethanol plant is considered a single producer. The amount of the payment for each
producer's annual production, except as provided in paragraph (c), is 20 cents per gallon for each
gallon of ethanol produced at a specific location on or before June 30, 2000, or ten years after the
start of production, whichever is later. Annually, within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year, an
ethanol producer receiving payments under this subdivision must file a disclosure statement on
a form provided by the commissioner. The initial disclosure statement must include a summary
description of the organization of the business structure of the claimant, a listing of the percentages
of ownership by any person or other entity with an ownership interest of five percent or greater,
and a copy of its annual audited financial statements, including the auditor's report and footnotes.
The disclosure statement must include information demonstrating what percentage of the entity
receiving payments under this section is owned by farmers or other entities eligible to farm or own
agricultural land in Minnesota under the provisions of section 500.24. Subsequent annual reports
must reflect noncumulative changes in ownership of ten percent or more of the entity. The report
need not disclose the identity of the persons or entities eligible to farm or own agricultural land with
ownership interests, individuals residing within 30 miles of the plant, or of any other entity with
less than ten percent ownership interest, but the claimant must retain information within its files
confirming the accuracy of the data provided. This data must be made available to the commissioner
upon request. Not later than the 15th day of February in each year the commissioner shall deliver
to the chairs of the standing committees of the senate and the house of representatives that deal
with agricultural policy and agricultural finance issues an annual report summarizing aggregated
data from plants receiving payments under this section during the preceding calendar year. Audited
financial statements and notes and disclosure statements submitted to the commissioner are
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 13
relating to nonpublic data, summaries of the submitted audited financial reports and notes and
disclosure statements will be contained in the report to the committee chairs and will be public data.
    (b) No payments shall be made for ethanol production that occurs after June 30, 2010. A producer
of ethanol shall not transfer the producer's eligibility for payments under this section to an ethanol
plant at a different location.
    (c) If the level of production at an ethanol plant increases due to an increase in the production
capacity of the plant, the payment under paragraph (a) applies to the additional increment of
production until ten years after the increased production began. Once a plant's production capacity
reaches 15,000,000 gallons per year, no additional increment will qualify for the payment.
   (d) Total payments under paragraphs (a) and (c) to a producer in a fiscal year may not exceed
$3,000,000.
    (e) By the last day of October, January, April, and July, each producer shall file a claim for
payment for ethanol production during the preceding three calendar months. A producer that files a
claim under this subdivision shall include a statement of the producer's total ethanol production in
Minnesota during the quarter covered by the claim. For each claim and statement of total ethanol
119TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 18, 2008                                        10753

production filed under this subdivision, the volume of ethanol production must be examined by an
independent certified public accountant in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
   (f) Payments shall be made November 15, February 15, May 15, and August 15. A separate
payment shall be made for each claim filed. Except as provided in paragraph (g), the total quarterly
payment to a producer under this paragraph may not exceed $750,000.
    (g) Notwithstanding the quarterly payment limits of paragraph (f), the commissioner shall make
an additional payment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to ethanol producers for the lesser of:
(1) 20 cents per gallon of production in the fourth quarter of the year that is greater than 3,750,000
gallons; or (2) the total amount of payments lost during the first three quarters of the fiscal year due
to plant outages, repair, or major maintenance. Total payments to an ethanol producer in a fiscal
year, including any payment under this paragraph, must not exceed the total amount the producer
is eligible to receive based on the producer's approved production capacity. The provisions of this
paragraph apply only to production losses that occur in quarters beginning after December 31, 1999.
    (h) The commissioner shall reimburse ethanol producers for any deficiency in payments
during earlier quarters if the deficiency occurred because of unallotment or because appropriated
money was insufficient to make timely payments in the full amount provided in paragraph (a).
Notwithstanding the quarterly or annual payment limitations in this subdivision, the commissioner
shall begin making payments for earlier deficiencies in each fiscal year that appropriations for
ethanol payments exceed the amount required to make eligible scheduled payments. Payments for
earlier deficiencies must continue until the deficiencies for each producer are paid in full, except
the commissioner shall not make a deficiency payment to an entity that no longer produces ethanol
on a commercial scale at the location for which the entity qualified for producer payments, or to
an assignee of the entity.
    (i) The commissioner may make direct payments to producers of rural economic infrastructure
with any amount of the annual appropriation for ethanol producer payments and rural economic
infrastructure that is in excess of the amount required to make scheduled ethanol producer payments
and deficiency payments under paragraphs (a) to (h).
   Sec. 6. Laws 2007, chapter 45, article 1, section 3, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

systems, or certain nongovernmental
entities. For the purposes of this paragraph,
"bioenergy" includes transportation fuels
derived from cellulosic material as well as
the generation of energy for commercial heat,
industrial process heat, or electrical power
from cellulosic material via gasification or
other processes. The board must give priority
to a bioenergy facility that is at least 60
percent owned and controlled by farmers,
as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section
500.24, subdivision 2, paragraph (n), or
natural persons residing in the county or
counties contiguous to where the facility is
located. Grants are limited to 50 percent of
the cost of research, technical assistance, or
equipment related to bioenergy production
or $­­

of Revenue's database of debtors. The commissioner, in consultation with representatives from

    Subd. 6. Access to data. (a) With regard to account information on all account holders provided

retention, publication, or any other use of that data shall be made by the financial institution.
    Subd. 7. Fees. A financial institution may charge and collect a fee from the commissioner
for providing account information to the commissioner. The commissioner may pay a financial
institution up to $150 each quarter. The commissioner shall develop procedures for the financial
institutions to charge and collect the fee. Payment of the fee is limited by the amount of the
appropriation for this purpose. If the appropriation is insufficient, or if fund availability in the
fourth quarter would allow payments for actual costs in excess of $150, the commissioner shall
prorate the available funds among the financial institutions that have submitted a claim for the fee.
No financial institution shall charge or collect a fee that exceeds its actual costs of complying with
this section. The commissioner, together with an advisory group consisting of representatives of
the financial institutions in the state, shall evaluate whether the fees paid to financial institutions
compensate them for their actual costs, including start-up costs, of complying with this section, and
shall evaluate whether the amount appropriated to the commissioner for the costs of administering
the data match system compensates the commissioner for the costs incurred by the department. The
advisory group shall submit a report to the legislature by February 1, 2009, with a recommendation
for retaining or modifying the fee.
    Subd. 8. Failure to respond to request for information. The commissioner shall send a written
notice of noncompliance to a financial institution that fails to respond to a first written request
for information under this section. The notice must be sent by certified mail and must explain the
requirements of this section and advise the financial institution of the penalty for noncompliance.
A financial institution that receives a second notice of noncompliance is subject to a civil penalty
of $1,000 for its failure to comply. A financial institution that continues to fail to comply with this
section is subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 for the third and each subsequent failure to comply.
The penalties imposed under this subdivision are collected in the same manner as taxes. A financial
institution that has been served with a notice of noncompliance and incurs a second or subsequent
notice of noncompliance has the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14. A financial
institution has 20 days from the date of the service of the notice of noncompliance to file a request

for a contested case hearing with the commissioner. The order of the administrative law judge
constitutes the final decision in this case. A financial institution is considered to be in compliance
with this section if it demonstrates that it is working in good faith to implement the data match
program.

this section is prohibited from disclosing to a debtor that the name of the debtor has been received
from or furnished to the commissioner.
    Subd. 10. Immunity. A financial institution that provides or reasonably attempts to provide
information to the commissioner in compliance with this section is not liable to any person for
disclosing the information or for taking any other action in good faith as authorized by this section.

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256B.0625, subdivision 20, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 20. Mental health case management. (a) To the extent authorized by rule of the state
agency, medical assistance covers case management services to persons with serious and persistent
mental illness and children with severe emotional disturbance. Services provided under this section
must meet the relevant standards in sections 245.461 to 245.4887, the Comprehensive Adult and
Children's Mental Health Acts, Minnesota Rules, parts 9520.0900 to 9520.0926, and 9505.0322,
excluding subpart 10.
    (b) Entities meeting program standards set out in rules governing family community support
services as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 17, are eligible for medical assistance
reimbursement for case management services for children with severe emotional disturbance when
these services meet the program standards in Minnesota Rules, parts 9520.0900 to 9520.0926 and
9505.0322, excluding subparts 6 and 10.
    (c) Medical assistance and MinnesotaCare payment for mental health case management shall

document at least a face-to-face contact with the child, the child's parents, or the child's legal
representative. To receive payment for an eligible adult, the provider must document:
   (1) at least a face-to-face contact with the adult or the adult's legal representative; or
10822                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [119TH DAY

    (2) at least a telephone contact with the adult or the adult's legal representative and document
a face-to-face contact with the adult or the adult's legal representative within the preceding two
months.
    (d) Payment for mental health case management provided by county or state staff shall be

   (e) Payment for mental health case management provided by Indian health services or by
agencies operated by Indian tribes may be made according to this section or other relevant federally
approved rate setting methodology.
    (f) Payment for mental health case management provided by vendors who contract with a county
or Indian tribe shall be based on a monthly rate negotiated by the host county or tribe. The negotiated
rate must not exceed the rate charged by the vendor for the same service to other payers. If the service
is provided by a team of contracted vendors, the county or tribe may negotiate a team rate with a
vendor who is a member of the team. The team shall determine how to distribute the rate among
its members. No reimbursement received by contracted vendors shall be returned to the county or
tribe, except to reimburse the county or tribe for advance funding provided by the county or tribe
to the vendor.
    (g) If the service is provided by a team which includes contracted vendors, tribal staff, and county
or state staff, the costs for county or state staff participation in the team shall be included in the rate
for county-provided services. In this case, the contracted vendor, the tribal agency, and the county
may each receive separate payment for services provided by each entity in the same month. In order
to prevent duplication of services, each entity must document, in the recipient's file, the need for
team case management and a description of the roles of the team members.
    (h) Notwithstanding section 256B.19, subdivision 1, the nonfederal share of costs for mental
health case management shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility, as defined in
sections 256G.01 to 256G.12, from sources other than federal funds or funds used to match other
federal funds. If the service is provided by a tribal agency, the nonfederal share, if any, shall be
provided by the recipient's tribe. When this service is paid by the state without a federal share through
fee-for-service, 50 percent of the cost shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility.
    (i) Notwithstanding any administrative rule to the contrary, prepaid medical assistance, general
assistance medical care, and MinnesotaCare include mental health case management. When the
service is provided through prepaid capitation, the nonfederal share is paid by the state and the
county pays no share.
    (j) The commissioner may suspend, reduce, or terminate the reimbursement to a provider that
does not meet the reporting or other requirements of this section. The county of responsibility, as
defined in sections 256G.01 to 256G.12, or, if applicable, the tribal agency, is responsible for any
federal disallowances. The county or tribe may share this responsibility with its contracted vendors.
   (k) The commissioner shall set aside a portion of the federal funds earned for county
expenditures under this section to repay the special revenue maximization account under section
256.01, subdivision 2, clause (15). The repayment is limited to:

    (1) the costs of developing and implementing this section; and
    (2) programming the information systems.
    (l) Payments to counties and tribal agencies for case management expenditures under this section
shall only be made from federal earnings from services provided under this section. When this
service is paid by the state without a federal share through fee-for-service, 50 percent of the cost
shall be provided by the state. Payments to county-contracted vendors shall include the federal
earnings, the state share, and the county share.
    (m) Case management services under this subdivision do not include therapy, treatment, legal,
or outreach services.
    (n) If the recipient is a resident of a nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or hospital, and the
recipient's institutional care is paid by medical assistance, payment for case management services
under this subdivision is limited to the lesser of:
    (1) the last 180 days of the recipient's residency in that facility and may not exceed more than
six months in a calendar year; or
    (2) the limits and conditions which apply to federal Medicaid funding for this service.
  (o) Payment for case management services under this subdivision shall not duplicate payments
made under other program authorities for the same purpose.
    Sec. 5. [256B.0658] HOUSING ACCESS GRANTS.
    The commissioner of human services shall award through a competitive process contracts for
grants to public and private agencies to support and assist individuals eligible for publicly funded
home and community-based services, including state plan home care, to access housing. Grants may
be awarded to agencies that may include, but are not limited to, the following supports: assessment to
assure suitability of housing, accompanying an individual to look at housing, filling out applications
and rental agreements, meeting with landlords, helping with Section 8 or other program applications,
helping to develop a budget, obtaining furniture and household goods, if necessary, and assisting
with any problems that may arise with housing.

disabilities, targeted case management services must meet the provisions of section 256B.092.

management service activities include:

    (3) a regular review and revision of the written personal service plan with the recipient and the
recipient's legal representative, and others as identified by the recipient, to ensure access to necessary
services and supports identified in the plan;
    (4) effective communication with the recipient and the recipient's legal representative and others

prior to the recipient's discharge into the community; and
    (13) a personal service plan developed and reviewed at least annually with the recipient and the
recipient's legal representative. The personal service plan must be revised when there is a change in
the recipient's status. The personal service plan must identify:
   (i) the desired personal short and long-term outcomes;
   (ii) the recipient's preferences for services and supports, including development of a
person-centered plan if requested; and
    (iii) formal and informal services and supports based on areas of assessment, such as: social,
health, mental health, residence, family, educational and vocational, safety, legal, self-determination,
financial, and chemical health as determined by the recipient and the recipient's legal representative
and the recipient's support network.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0924, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Payment for targeted case management. (a) Medical assistance and MinnesotaCare
payment for targeted case management shall be made on a monthly basis. In order to receive
payment for an eligible adult, the provider must document at least one contact per month and not
more than two consecutive months without a face-to-face contact with the adult or the adult's legal
representative, family, primary caregiver, or other relevant persons identified as necessary to the
development or implementation of the goals of the personal service plan.
    (b) Payment for targeted case management provided by county staff under this subdivision shall
be based on the monthly rate methodology under section 256B.094, subdivision 6, paragraph (b),
calculated as one combined average rate together with adult mental health case management under
section 256B.0625, subdivision 20, except for calendar year 2002. In calendar year 2002, the rate
for case management under this section shall be the same as the rate for adult mental health case

management in effect as of December 31, 2001. Billing and payment must identify the recipient's
primary population group to allow tracking of revenues.
    (c) Payment for targeted case management provided by county-contracted vendors shall be based
on a monthly rate negotiated by the host county. The negotiated rate must not exceed the rate charged
by the vendor for the same service to other payers. If the service is provided by a team of contracted
vendors, the county may negotiate a team rate with a vendor who is a member of the team. The
team shall determine how to distribute the rate among its members. No reimbursement received
by contracted vendors shall be returned to the county, except to reimburse the county for advance
funding provided by the county to the vendor.
    (d) If the service is provided by a team that includes contracted vendors and county staff, the
costs for county staff participation on the team shall be included in the rate for county-provided
services. In this case, the contracted vendor and the county may each receive separate payment for
services provided by each entity in the same month. In order to prevent duplication of services, the
county must document, in the recipient's file, the need for team targeted case management and a
description of the different roles of the team members.
   (e) Notwithstanding section 256B.19, subdivision 1, the nonfederal share of costs for targeted
case management shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility, as defined in sections
256G.01 to 256G.12, from sources other than federal funds or funds used to match other federal
funds.
    (f) The commissioner may suspend, reduce, or terminate reimbursement to a provider that does
not meet the reporting or other requirements of this section. The county of responsibility, as defined
in sections 256G.01 to 256G.12, is responsible for any federal disallowances. The county may share
this responsibility with its contracted vendors.
    (g) The commissioner shall set aside five percent of the federal funds received under this section
for use in reimbursing the state for costs of developing and implementing this section.
   (h) Payments to counties for targeted case management expenditures under this section shall only
be made from federal earnings from services provided under this section. Payments to contracted
vendors shall include both the federal earnings and the county share.
    (i) Notwithstanding section 256B.041, county payments for the cost of case management
services provided by county staff shall not be made to the commissioner of finance. For the
purposes of targeted case management services provided by county staff under this section, the
centralized disbursement of payments to counties under section 256B.041 consists only of federal
earnings from services provided under this section.
    (j) If the recipient is a resident of a nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or hospital, and the
recipient's institutional care is paid by medical assistance, payment for targeted case management
services under this subdivision is limited to the lesser of:

     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.19, subdivision 1d, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1d. Portion of nonfederal share to be paid by certain counties. (a) In addition to the
percentage contribution paid by a county under subdivision 1, the governmental units designated
in this subdivision shall be responsible for an additional portion of the nonfederal share of
medical assistance cost. For purposes of this subdivision, "designated governmental unit" means
the counties of Becker, Beltrami, Clearwater, Cook, Dodge, Hubbard, Itasca, Lake, Pennington,
Pipestone, Ramsey, St. Louis, Steele, Todd, Traverse, and Wadena.
    (b) Beginning in 1994, each of the governmental units designated in this subdivision shall
transfer before noon on May 31 to the state Medicaid agency an amount equal to the number of
licensed beds in any nursing home owned and operated by the county on that date, with the county
named as licensee, multiplied by $5,723. If two or more counties own and operate a nursing home,
the payment shall be prorated. These sums shall be part of the designated governmental unit's
portion of the nonfederal share of medical assistance costs.
    (c) Beginning in 2002, in addition to any transfer under paragraph (b), each of the governmental
units designated in this subdivision shall transfer before noon on May 31 to the state Medicaid
agency an amount equal to the number of licensed beds in any nursing home owned and operated
by the county on that date, with the county named as licensee, multiplied by $10,784. The provisions
of paragraph (b) apply to transfers under this paragraph.

    (b) Payments under paragraph (a) are excluded from medical assistance per diem rate
calculations. These payments are required notwithstanding any rule prohibiting medical assistance
payments from exceeding payments from private pay residents. A facility receiving a payment
under paragraph (a) may not increase charges to private pay residents by an amount equivalent to
the per diem amount payments under paragraph (a) would equal if converted to a per diem.
    (c) Beginning in 2002, in addition to any payment under paragraph (a), the commissioner shall
pay to a nursing facility described in paragraph (a) an adjustment in an amount equal to $29.55 per
calendar day multiplied by the number of beds licensed in the facility on that date. The provisions
of paragraphs (a) and (b) apply to payments under this paragraph.

256B.501, subdivision 12. A facility whose payment rates are governed by closure agreements,
receivership agreements, or Minnesota Rules, part 9553.0075, is not eligible for an adjustment
otherwise granted under this subdivision.
    (b) Seventy-five percent of the money resulting from the rate adjustments under paragraph (a)

     (c) Two-thirds of the money available under paragraph (b) must be used for wage increases for
all employees directly employed by the facility on or after the effective date of the rate adjustments,
except those listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3). The wage adjustment that employees receive
under this paragraph must be paid as an equal hourly percentage wage increase for all eligible
employees. All wage increases under this paragraph must be effective on the same date. Only costs
associated with the portion of the equal hourly percentage wage increase that goes to all employees
shall qualify under this paragraph. Costs associated with wage increases in excess of the amount

meeting the requirements in paragraph (b). This paragraph shall not apply to employees covered by
a collective bargaining agreement.
   (d) The commissioner shall allow as compensation-related costs all costs for:
   (1) wages and salaries;
   (2) FICA taxes, Medicare taxes, state and federal unemployment taxes, and workers'

commissioner within six months of the effective date of the rate adjustments, and the facility must
provide additional information required by the commissioner within nine months of the effective

   (1) an estimate of the amounts of money that must be used as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c);
    (2) a detailed distribution plan specifying the allowable compensation-related and wage
increases the facility will implement to use the funds available in clause (1);
    (3) a description of how the facility will notify eligible employees of the contents of the
approved application, which must provide for giving each eligible employee a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), or posting a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), for a period of at least six weeks in
an area of the facility to which all eligible employees have access; and
   (4) instructions for employees who believe they have not received the compensation-related or
wage increases specified in clause (2), as approved by the commissioner, and which must include
a mailing address, e-mail address, and the telephone number that may be used by the employee to
contact the commissioner or the commissioner's representative.
    (g) The commissioner shall ensure that cost increases in distribution plans under paragraph (f),
clause (2), that may be included in approved applications, comply with requirements in clauses (1)
to (4):
    (1) costs to be incurred during the applicable rate year resulting from wage and salary increases
effective after October 1, 2006, and prior to the first day of the facility's payroll period that includes
October 1 of each year shall be allowed if they were not used in the prior year's application and they
meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c);
   (2) a portion of the costs resulting from tenure-related wage or salary increases may be
considered to be allowable wage increases, according to formulas that the commissioner shall
provide, where employee retention is above the average statewide rate of retention of direct care
employees;
    (3) the annualized amount of increases in costs for the employer's share of health and dental
insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and workers' compensation shall be allowable
compensation-related increases if they are effective on or after April 1 of the year in which the rate
adjustments are effective and prior to April 1 of the following year; and
    (4) for facilities in which employees are represented by an exclusive bargaining representative,
the commissioner shall approve the application only upon receipt of a letter of acceptance of the
distribution plan, as regards members of the bargaining unit, signed by the exclusive bargaining
agent and dated after May 25, 2007. Upon receipt of the letter of acceptance, the commissioner
shall deem all requirements of this section as having been met in regard to the members of the
bargaining unit.
    (h) The commissioner shall review applications received under paragraph (f) and shall
provide the portion of the rate adjustments under paragraphs (b) and (c) if the requirements of
this subdivision have been met. The rate adjustments shall be effective October 1 of each year.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the approved application distributes less money than is available,
the amount of the rate adjustment shall be reduced so that the amount of money made available
is equal to the amount to be distributed.

is not owned, operated, or controlled by a provider of service not related by blood or marriage.
    (2) Notwithstanding subdivision 3, paragraph (c), an individual eligible for the shelter needy
benefit under this paragraph is considered a household of one. An eligible individual who receives
this benefit prior to age 65 may continue to receive the benefit after the age of 65.
    (3) "Shelter needy" means that the assistance unit incurs monthly shelter costs that exceed 40
percent of the assistance unit's gross income before the application of this special needs standard.
"Gross income" for the purposes of this section is the applicant's or recipient's income as defined
in section 256D.35, subdivision 10, or the standard specified in subdivision 3, paragraph (a) or (b),
whichever is greater. A recipient of a federal or state housing subsidy, that limits shelter costs to a
percentage of gross income, shall not be considered shelter needy for purposes of this paragraph.

    (m) Within six months after the effective date of each rate adjustment, the provider shall
post this plan, excluding the information required in paragraph (l), clause (1), for a period of at
least six weeks in an area of the provider's operation to which all eligible employees have access
and provide instructions for employees who believe they have not received the wage and other
compensation-related increases specified in paragraph (l), clause (2). Instructions must include
a mailing address, e-mail address, and the telephone number that may be used by the employee
to contact the commissioner or the commissioner's representative. Providers shall also make
assurances to the commissioner and counties with whom they have a contract that they have
complied with the requirement in this paragraph.

as a result of wage or salary withholding authorized by this section. A payor of funds shall be liable
to the obligee for any amounts required to be withheld. A payor of funds that fails to withhold or
transfer funds in accordance with this section is also liable to the obligee for interest on the funds
at the rate applicable to judgments under section 549.09, computed from the date the funds were
required to be withheld or transferred. A payor of funds is liable for reasonable attorney fees of the
obligee or public authority incurred in enforcing the liability under this paragraph. A payor of funds
that has failed to comply with the requirements of this section is subject to contempt sanctions under
section 518A.73. If the payor of funds is an employer or independent contractor and violates this
subdivision, a court may award the obligor twice the wages lost as a result of this violation. If a
court finds a payor of funds violated this subdivision, the court shall impose a civil fine of not less
than $500. The liabilities in this paragraph apply to intentional noncompliance with this section.

    (d) If a single employee is subject to multiple withholding orders or multiple notices of
withholding for the support of more than one child, the payor of funds shall comply with all of the
orders or notices to the extent that the total amount withheld from the obligor's income does not
exceed the limits imposed under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, United States Code, title 15,
section 1673(b), giving priority to amounts designated in each order or notice as current support
as follows:
    (1) if the total of the amounts designated in the orders for or notices of withholding as current
support exceeds the amount available for income withholding, the payor of funds shall allocate to
each order or notice an amount for current support equal to the amount designated in that order or
notice as current support, divided by the total of the amounts designated in the orders or notices as
current support, multiplied by the amount of the income available for income withholding; and
    (2) if the total of the amounts designated in the orders for or notices of withholding as current
support does not exceed the amount available for income withholding, the payor of funds shall pay
the amounts designated as current support, and shall allocate to each order or notice an amount for
past due support, equal to the amount designated in that order or notice as past due support, divided
by the total of the amounts designated in the orders or notices as past due support, multiplied by the
amount of income remaining available for income withholding after the payment of current support.
    (e) When an order for or notice of withholding is in effect and the obligor's employment is
terminated, the obligor and the payor of funds shall notify the public authority of the termination
within ten days of the termination date. The termination notice shall include the obligor's home
address and the name and address of the obligor's new payor of funds, if known.
   (f) A payor of funds may deduct one dollar from the obligor's remaining salary for each payment
made pursuant to an order for or notice of withholding under this section to cover the expenses of
withholding.

finance shall transfer $50,000,000 from the health care access fund to the general fund.
    Subd. 2. Projected spending baseline. (a) By June 1, 2009, the commissioner of health shall
calculate the annual projected total private and public health care spending for residents of this state
and establish a health care spending baseline, beginning for calendar year 2008 and for the next ten
years based on the annual projected growth in spending.
    (b) In establishing the health care spending baseline, the commissioner shall use the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services forecast for total growth in national health care expenditures
and adjust this forecast to reflect the demographics, health status, and other factors deemed

necessary by the commissioner. The commissioner shall contract with an actuarial consultant to
make recommendations for the adjustments needed to specifically reflect projected spending for
residents of this state.
   (c) The commissioner may adjust the projected baseline as necessary to reflect any updated
federal projections or account for unanticipated changes in federal policy.

    Subd. 3. Actual spending and savings determination. By June 1, 2010, and each June 1
thereafter until June 1, 2020, the commissioner of health shall determine the actual total private
and public health care spending for residents of this state for the calendar year two years before the
current calendar year, based on data collected under chapter 62J, and shall determine the difference
between the projected spending, as determined under subdivision 2, and the actual spending for
that year. The actual spending must be certified by an independent actuarial consultant. If the
actual spending is less than the projected spending, the commissioner shall determine, based on
the proportion of spending for state-administered health care programs to total private and public
health care spending for the calendar year two years before the current calendar year, the percentage
of the calculated aggregate savings amount accruing to state-administered health care programs.
    Subd. 4. Repayment of transfer. When accumulated savings accruing to state-administered
health care programs, as calculated under subdivision 3, meet or exceed $50,000,000, the
commissioner of health shall certify that event to the commissioner of finance. In the next fiscal
year following the certification, the commissioner of finance shall transfer $50,000,000 from
the general fund to the health care access fund. The amount necessary to make the transfer is
appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of finance.
   Subd. 5. Definitions. (a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
   (b) "Public health care spending" means spending for a state-administered health care program.
    (c) "State-administered health care program" means medical assistance, MinnesotaCare, general
assistance medical care, and the state employee group insurance program.
   Sec. 2. [144.058] INTERPRETER SERVICES QUALITY INITIATIVE.
    (a) The commissioner of health shall establish a voluntary statewide roster, and develop a plan
for a registry and certification process for interpreters who provide high quality, spoken language
health care interpreter services. The roster, registry, and certification process shall be based on the
findings and recommendations set forth by the Interpreter Services Work Group required under
Laws 2007, chapter 147, article 12, section 13.

training programs do not exist;
      (iii) recommendations for appropriate fees; and
      (iv) recommendations for establishing and maintaining the standards for inclusion in the registry;

      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 144E.45, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Potential allocations. (a) On November 1, annually, the board or the board's designee
under section 144E.40, subdivision 2, shall determine the amount of the allocation of the prior year's
accumulation to each qualified ambulance service person. The prior year's net investment gain or
loss under paragraph (b) must be allocated and that year's general fund appropriation, plus any
transfer from the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance account under section 144E.42, subdivision 2,
and after deduction of administrative expenses, also must be allocated.
    (b) The difference in the market value of the assets of the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance trust
account as of the immediately previous June 30 and the June 30 occurring 12 months earlier must
be reported on or before August 15 by the State Board of Investment. The market value gain or loss
must be expressed as a percentage of the total potential award accumulations as of the immediately
previous June 30, and that positive or negative percentage must be applied to increase or decrease
the recorded potential award accumulation of each qualified ambulance service person.
    (c) The appropriation for this purpose, after deduction of administrative expenses, must be
divided by the total number of additional ambulance service personnel years of service recognized
since the last allocation or 1,000 years of service, whichever is greater. If the allocation is based on
the 1,000 years of service, any allocation not made for a qualified ambulance service person must
be credited to the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance account under section 144E.42, subdivision
2. A qualified ambulance service person must be credited with a year of service if the person is
certified by the chief administrative officer of the ambulance service as having rendered active
ambulance service during the 12 months ending as of the immediately previous June 30. If the
person has rendered prior active ambulance service, the person must be additionally credited with

prior service. Prior active ambulance service means employment by or the provision of service to a
licensed ambulance service before June 30, 1993, as determined by the person's current ambulance
service based on records provided by the person that were contemporaneous to the service. The
prior ambulance service must be reported on or before August 1 to the board in an affidavit from

   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 145.9255, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. To the extent funds are available for the purposes of this
subdivision, the commissioner of health, in consultation with a representative from Minnesota
planning, the commissioner of human services, and the commissioner of education, shall develop
and implement the Minnesota education now and babies later (MN ENABL) program, targeted to
adolescents ages 12 to 14, with the goal of reducing the incidence of adolescent pregnancy in the
state and promoting abstinence until marriage. The program must provide a multifaceted, primary
prevention, community health promotion approach to educating and supporting adolescents in the
decision to postpone sexual involvement modeled after the ENABL program in California. The
commissioner of health shall consult with the chief of the health education section of the California
Department of Health Services for general guidance in developing and implementing the program.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.969, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Operating payment rates. In determining operating payment rates for admissions
occurring on or after the rate year beginning January 1, 1991, and every two years after, or more
frequently as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall obtain operating data from
an updated base year and establish operating payment rates per admission for each hospital based on
the cost-finding methods and allowable costs of the Medicare program in effect during the base year.
Rates under the general assistance medical care, medical assistance, and MinnesotaCare programs
shall not be rebased to more current data on January 1, 1997, ­
                                                              an

24 months of the rebased period beginning January 1, 2009. The base year operating payment rate
per admission is standardized by the case mix index and adjusted by the hospital cost index, relative
values, and disproportionate population adjustment. The cost and charge data used to establish
operating rates shall only reflect inpatient services covered by medical assistance and shall not
include property cost information and costs recognized in outlier payments.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or

after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.
    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
   (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded
from this paragraph.

admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2005, made to hospitals for inpatient services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 6.0 percent from the current statutory rates. Mental
health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 and facilities defined under subdivision
16 are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for
purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care.
Payments made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January
1, 2006, to reflect this reduction.

fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, made to
hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 3.46 percent
from the current statutory rates. Mental health services with diagnosis related groups 424 to 432
and facilities defined under subdivision 16 are excluded from this paragraph. Payments made to

     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0571, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Program established. (a) The commissioner, in cooperation with the commissioner of
commerce, shall establish the Minnesota partnership for long-term care program to provide for the
financing of long-term care through a combination of private insurance and medical assistance.
    (b) An individual who meets the requirements in this paragraph is eligible to participate in the
partnership program. The individual must:
    (1) be a Minnesota resident at the time coverage first became effective under the partnership
policy; and
    (2) be a beneficiary of a partnership policy that (i) is issued on or after the effective date of
the state plan amendment implementing the partnership program in Minnesota, or (ii) qualifies as a
partnership policy under the provisions of subdivision 8a; ­­­

     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0571, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
   Subd. 9. Medical assistance eligibility. (a) Upon application for medical assistance program
payment of long-term care services by an individual who meets the requirements described in
subdivision 8, the commissioner shall determine the individual's eligibility for medical assistance
according to paragraphs (b) to (i).
    (b) After determining assets subject to the asset limit under section 256B.056, subdivision 3 or
3c, or 256B.057, subdivision 9 or 10, the commissioner shall allow the individual to designate assets
to be protected from recovery under subdivisions 13 and 15 up to the dollar amount of the benefits
utilized under the partnership policy as of the effective date of eligibility for medical assistance
program payment of long-term care services. Benefits utilized under a long-term care insurance
policy before July 1, 2006, do not count for the purpose of determining the amount of assets that
can be designated. Designated assets shall be disregarded for purposes of determining eligibility
for payment of long-term care services. The dollar amount of benefits utilized must be equal to the
amount of claims paid by the issuer under the policy as verified by the issuer.
     (c) The individual shall identify the designated assets and the full fair market value of those

assistance payment of long-term care services. The full fair market value of real property or interests
in real property shall be based on the most recent full assessed value for property tax purposes for
the real property, unless the individual provides a complete professional appraisal by a licensed
appraiser to establish the full fair market value. The extent of a life estate in real property shall be
determined using the life estate table in the health care program's manual. Ownership of any asset
in joint tenancy shall be treated as ownership as tenants in common for purposes of its designation
as a disregarded asset. The unprotected value of any protected asset is subject to estate recovery
according to subdivisions 13 and 15.
    (d) The right to designate assets to be protected is personal to the individual and ends when
the individual dies, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions 13 and 15. It does not include the
increase in the value of the protected asset and the income, dividends, or profits from the asset. It
may be exercised by the individual or by anyone with the legal authority to do so on the individual's
behalf. It shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, or given away.

this purpose must reduce the unused amount of asset protection available to protect assets in the
individual's estate from recovery under section 256B.15 or 524.3-1202, or otherwise.
    (f) This section applies only to estate recovery under United States Code, title 42, section 1396p,
subsections (a) and (b), and does not apply to recovery authorized by other provisions of federal law,
including, but not limited to, recovery from trusts under United States Code, title 42, section 1396p,
subsection (d)(4)(A) and (C), or to recovery from annuities, or similar legal instruments, subject to
section 6012, subsections (a) and (b), of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Public Law 109-171.
    (g) An individual's protected assets owned by the individual's spouse who applies for payment of
medical assistance long-term care services shall not be protected assets or disregarded for purposes
of eligibility of the individual's spouse solely because they were protected assets of the individual.
   (h) Assets designated under this subdivision shall not be subject to penalty under section
256B.0595.
   (i) The commissioner shall otherwise determine the individual's eligibility for payment of
long-term care services according to medical assistance eligibility requirements.
      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13e, is amended to read:

lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable

cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the
usual and customary price charged to the public. The amount of payment basis must be reduced
to reflect all discount amounts applied to the charge by any provider/insurer agreement or contract
for submitted charges to medical assistance programs. The net submitted charge may not be greater
than the patient liability for the service. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.65, except that
the dispensing fee for intravenous solutions which must be compounded by the pharmacist shall
be $8 per bag, $14 per bag for cancer chemotherapy products, and $30 per bag for total parenteral
nutritional products dispensed in one liter quantities, or $44 per bag for total parenteral nutritional
products dispensed in quantities greater than one liter. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity and
other special discounts except time and cash discounts. Effective July 1, 2008, the actual acquisition
cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus ­        12­ 14
percent. The actual acquisition cost of antihemophilic factor drugs shall be estimated at the average
wholesale price minus 30 percent. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug may be set
by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum amount paid
by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs. Establishment
of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative
Procedure Act.
    (b) An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists
for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose
blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the
pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug
container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose
blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules,
part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy
provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs
that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's
unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity
that is less than a 30-day supply.
    (c) Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the
actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, or on the maximum allowable cost established by the
commissioner.
    (d) The basis for determining the amount of payment for drugs administered in an outpatient
setting shall be the lower of the usual and customary cost submitted by the provider or the amount
established for Medicare by the United States Department of Health and Human Services pursuant
to title XVIII, section 1847a of the federal Social Security Act.
    (e) The commissioner may negotiate lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmacy
products than the rates specified in paragraph (a). The commissioner may require individuals
enrolled in the health care programs administered by the department to obtain specialty pharmacy
products from providers with whom the commissioner has negotiated lower reimbursement rates.
Specialty pharmacy products are defined as those used by a small number of recipients or recipients
with complex and chronic diseases that require expensive and challenging drug regimens. Examples
of these conditions include, but are not limited to: multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, transplantation,
hepatitis C, growth hormone deficiency, Crohn's Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain forms of
cancer. Specialty pharmaceutical products include injectable and infusion therapies, biotechnology

drugs, high-cost therapies, and therapies that require complex care. The commissioner shall consult
with the formulary committee to develop a list of specialty pharmacy products subject to this
paragraph. In consulting with the formulary committee in developing this list, the commissioner
shall take into consideration the population served by specialty pharmacy products, the current
delivery system and standard of care in the state, and access to care issues. The commissioner shall
have the discretion to adjust the reimbursement rate to prevent access to care issues.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256B.0631, subdivision 1, is amended to

podiatrist, nurse midwife, advanced practice nurse, audiologist, optician, or optometrist;
   (2) $3 for eyeglasses;
   (3) $6 for nonemergency visits to a hospital-based emergency room; and

    (3) for individuals identified by the commissioner with income at or below 100 percent of
the federal poverty guidelines, total monthly co-payments must not exceed five percent of family
income. For purposes of this paragraph, family income is the total earned and unearned income of
the individual and the individual's spouse, if the spouse is enrolled in medical assistance and also
subject to the five percent limit on co-payments.
   (c) Recipients of medical assistance are responsible for all co-payments in this subdivision.

   Subdivision 1. Facility fee for hospital emergency room and clinic visit. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a facility fee payment mechanism that will pay a facility fee to all enrolled outpatient
hospitals for each emergency room or outpatient clinic visit provided on or after July 1, 1989. This
payment mechanism may not result in an overall increase in outpatient payment rates. This section
does not apply to federally mandated maximum payment limits, department-approved program
packages, or services billed using a nonoutpatient hospital provider number.
    (b) For fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before

were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical assistance
and general assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each
performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except
in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment
of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The
withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets
in the contract are achieved. The commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under
subdivision 23. A managed care plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692
may include as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph
that is reasonably expected to be returned.
    (d)(1) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, the commissioner shall
withhold three percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical

1992, the commissioner of human services shall pay the lower of (1) submitted charge, or (2) 32
percent above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992, except for those services for which there is a
federal maximum allowable payment. Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000,
payment rates for nonsurgical outpatient hospital facility fees and emergency room facility fees shall
be increased by eight percent over the rates in effect on December 31, 1999, except for those services
for which there is a federal maximum allowable payment. Services for which there is a federal
maximum allowable payment shall be paid at the lower of (1) submitted charge, or (2) the federal
maximum allowable payment. Total aggregate payment for outpatient hospital facility fee services
shall not exceed the Medicare upper limit. If it is determined that a provision of this section conflicts
with existing or future requirements of the United States government with respect to federal financial
participation in medical assistance, the federal requirements prevail. The commissioner may, in
the aggregate, prospectively reduce payment rates to avoid reduced federal financial participation

the 2003 legislature to define and implement this provision.
    (d) For fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services is
reduced by .5 percent from the current statutory rate.
