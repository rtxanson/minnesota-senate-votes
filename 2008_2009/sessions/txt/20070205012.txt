    Subd. 2a. Eligible energy technology standard. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b),
each electric utility shall generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by an eligible energy
technology to provide its retail customers in Minnesota, or the retail customers of a distribution
utility to which the electric utility provides wholesale electric service, so that at least the following
standard percentages of the electric utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota
is generated by eligible energy technologies by the end of the year indicated:
(1)                       2012                      12 percent
(2)                       2016                      17 percent
(3)                       2020                      20 percent
(4)                       2025                      25 percent.

    (b) An electric utility that owned a nuclear generating facility as of January 1, 2007, must
meet the requirements of this paragraph rather than paragraph (a). An electric utility subject to this
paragraph must generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by an eligible energy technology
to provide its retail customers in Minnesota or the retail customer of a distribution utility to which
the electric utility provides wholesale electric service so that at least the following percentages
of the electric utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota is generated by
eligible energy technologies by the end of the year indicated:
(1)                        2010                   15 percent
(2)                        2012                   18 percent
(3)                        2016                   25 percent
(4)                        2020                   30 percent.

    Of the 30 percent in 2020, at least 25 percent must be generated by wind energy conversion
systems and the remaining five percent by other eligible energy technology.
   Subd. 2b. Modification or delay of standard. (a) The commission shall modify or delay the
implementation of a standard obligation, in whole or in part, if the commission determines it is in
210                                                    JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                 [12TH DAY

the public interest to do so. The commission, when requested to modify or delay implementation
of a standard, must consider: (1) the impact of implementing the standard on its customer's utility
costs, including the economic and competitive pressure on the utility's customers; (2) the effects
of implementing the standard on the reliability of the electric system; (3) technical advances or
technical concerns; (4) delays in acquiring sites or routes due to rejection or delays of necessary
siting or other permitting approvals; (5) delays, cancellations, or nondelivery of necessary
equipment for construction or commercial operation of an eligible energy technology facility; (6)
transmission constraints preventing delivery of service; and (7) other statutory obligations imposed
on the commission or a utility. The commission may modify or delay implementation of a standard
obligation under clauses (1) to (3) only if it finds implementation would cause significant rate
impact, requires significant measures to address reliability, or raises significant technical issues.
The commission may modify or delay implementation of a standard obligation under clauses (4)
to (6) only if it finds that the circumstances described in those clauses were due to circumstances
beyond an electric utility's control and make compliance not feasible.
    (b) When considering whether to delay or modify implementation of a standard obligation,
the commission must give due consideration to a preference for electric generation through use
of eligible energy technology and to the achievement of the standards set by this section.
    (c) An electric utility requesting a modification or delay in the implementation of a standard
must file a plan to comply with its standard obligation in the same proceeding that it is requesting
the delay.
    Subd. 2c. Use of integrated resource planning process. The commission may exercise its
authority under subdivision 2b to modify or delay implementation of a standard obligation as part of
an integrated resource planning proceeding under section 216B.2422. The commission's authority
must be exercised according to subdivision 2b. The order to delay or modify shall not be considered
advisory with respect to any electric utility. This subdivision is in addition to and does not limit
the commission's authority to modify or delay implementation of a standard obligation in other
proceedings before the commission.

to support the renewable energy standards and milestones established in Minnesota Statutes, section
216B.1691, subdivision 2a. The study process must be designed to identify and optimize delivery
of that renewable energy to Minnesota retail customers while maintaining system reliability.
    As part of the planning process, Minnesota electric utilities shall incorporate and build upon
the analyses that have previously been done or that are in progress, including, but not limited
to, the 2006 Minnesota Wind Integration Study and ongoing work to address geographically
dispersed development patterns. The Minnesota electric utilities shall collaborate with the Midwest
Independent System Operator to optimize and integrate to the extent possible Minnesota's
transmission plans with other regional transmission considerations.
    As part of the planning process, utilities shall convene and regularly consult with a group of
stakeholders with experience and expertise in transmission system engineering and renewable
generation technology to review the study's proposed methods and assumptions, preliminary
results, and ongoing efforts.
   Utilities shall submit a report to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission by November 1,
2007, describing the activities undertaken pursuant to this section. The report shall include:
    (1) a description of the analyses that have been undertaken and the results, including the critical
issues that need to be addressed in order to develop the transmission needed to meet the standards
and milestones of Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.1691, subdivision 2a;
    (2) a comprehensive conceptual plan to guide ongoing planning efforts to develop the
transmission necessary to support those standards and milestones;
   (3) specific transmission line proposals necessary to meet those intermediate standards and
milestones;
    (4) a description of how the results of these studies have been reflected in the biennial
transmission reports filed under Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.2425; and
    (5) a five-year action plan that identifies with specificity the actions necessary to implement the
specific proposals and to refine and further develop the transmission plans needed to support those
standards and milestones, including initiating any certificate of need or other regulatory proceeding
necessary to implement the specific proposals identified above.
