the registration on the vehicle for the remainder of the period prescribed under subdivision 1 had
the applicant not utilized the exception in this subdivision. Upon the renewal of registration, the
applicant shall pay 1/12 of the annual tax for each calendar month remaining in the registration
period in addition to a $10 administrative fee. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the applicant
from purchasing registration for an additional full registration period in conjunction with the
purchase of the remainder portion.
    (b) In any instance except that of a licensed motor vehicle lessor, the registrar shall not approve
registering the vehicle subject to the application for a period of less than three months, except when
the registrar determines that to do otherwise will help to equalize the registration and renewal work
load of the department.
   (c) The fee collected under paragraph (a), clause (2), must be deposited in the vehicle services
operating account in the special revenue fund as specified in section 299A.705.

cover the cost of manufacturing and issuing the plate or plates, except for plates issued to disabled

roadway by any person who does not possess a valid driver's license, unless the person has
obtained a motorized bicycle operator's permit or motorized bicycle instruction permit from
the commissioner of public safety. The operator's permit may be issued to any person who has
attained the age of 15 years and who has passed the examination prescribed by the commissioner.
The instruction permit may be issued to any person who has attained the age of 15 years and
who has successfully completed an approved safety course and passed the written portion of the
examination prescribed by the commissioner.
   (b) This course must consist of, but is not limited to, a basic understanding of:

   (3) safe operating practices and basic operating techniques;
   (4) helmets and protective clothing;
   (5) motorized bicycle traffic strategies; and
   (6) effects of alcohol and drugs on motorized bicycle operators.
   (c) The commissioner may adopt rules prescribing the content of the safety course, examination,
and the information to be contained on the permits. A person operating a motorized bicycle under
a motorized bicycle permit is subject to the restrictions imposed by section 169.974, subdivision 2,
on operation of a motorcycle under a two-wheel instruction permit.

    (f) The board shall establish governance requirements, which may include staggered terms, term

reasonable co-payments for nonpreventive care. One plan must be a high-deductible health plan that
qualifies under federal law for use with a health savings account. The other four plans must have
levels of enrollee cost-sharing that are between the two plans just described. The board may establish
more than one tier of premium rates for any specific plan. Plans and premium rates may vary across
geographic regions established by the board. Any health plan or self-insured health benefit plan
offered by the board must comply with chapters 62A, 62J, 62M, 62Q, and 72A, and must provide

and self-insured health benefit plans offered.
    (f) The board may determine whether the plans should be fully insured through a health carrier
licensed in this state, self-insured, or a combination of those two alternatives. If at any time any
plan offered by the board is not fully insured, the board and the self-insured health benefit plan are
subject to section 471.617 and any rules adopted under that section, including Minnesota Rules,
chapter 2785.
   (g) Any health plan or self-insured health benefit plan must include disease management and
consumer education, including wellness programs and measures encouraging the wise use of health
coverage, to the extent determined to be appropriate by the board.

affairs. Claims expenses of the state plan which exceed the premium payments allocated to the
payment of benefits shall be the liability of the contributing members. Contributing members
shall share in the claims expense of the state plan and operating and administrative expenses of
the association in an amount equal to the ratio of the contributing member's total accident and
health insurance premium, received from or on behalf of Minnesota residents as divided by the
total accident and health insurance premium, received by all contributing members from or on

subdivision 9, paragraph (d), multiplied by the gross premiums less return premiums received in the
calendar year.

instruction, but instruction that is provided under this section is not eligible for aid under section
125A.76.
    (d) The instruction that is provided must differ from the initial instruction the pupil received in

   "Sec. 29. [124D.8955] PARENT AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT POLICY.
   (a) In order to promote and support student achievement, a local school board is encouraged to
formally adopt and implement a parent and family involvement policy that promotes and supports:
   (1) communication between home and school that is regular, two-way, and meaningful;
   (2) parenting skills;
    (3) parents and caregivers who play an integral role in assisting student learning and learn about
fostering students' academic success and learning at home and school;
   (4) welcoming parents in the school and seeking their support and assistance;
   (5) partnerships with parents in the decisions that affect children and families in the schools; and
   (6) providing community resources to strengthen schools, families, and student learning.
    (b) A school board that implements a parent and family involvement policy under paragraph
(a) must convene an advisory committee composed of an equal number of resident parents who are
not district employees and school staff to make recommendations to the board on developing and
evaluating the board's parent and family involvement policy. If possible, the advisory committee
must represent the diversity of the district. The advisory committee must consider the district's
demographic diversity and barriers to parent involvement when developing its recommendations.
The advisory committee must present its recommendations to the board for board consideration.
   (c) The board must consider best practices when implementing this policy.
    (d) The board periodically must review this policy to determine whether it is aligned with the
most current research findings on parent involvement policies and practices and how effective the
policy is in supporting increased student achievement.
   (e) Nothing in this section obligates a school district to exceed any parent or family involvement
requirement under federal law.

    (b) The commissioner must not approve budget increases under this section that would cause

United States Code, title 20, section 33, in any matter that affects the identification, evaluation,
placement, or change in placement of a pupil. The district must ensure the protection of a pupil's
civil rights, provide equal educational opportunities, and prohibit discrimination. Failure to comply
with this subdivision will at least cause a district to become ineligible to participate in the program.

   Subd. 2. Early intervening services program. (a) A district may meet the requirement under
subdivision 1 by establishing an early intervening services program that includes:
    (1) a system of valid and reliable general outcome measures aligned to state academic standards
that is administered at least three times per year to pupils in kindergarten through grade 8 who
need additional academic or behavioral support to succeed in the general education environment.
The school must provide interim assessments that measure pupils' performance three times per year
and implement progress monitoring appropriate to the pupil. For purposes of this section, "progress
monitoring" means the frequent and continuous measurement of a pupil's performance that includes
these three interim assessments and other pupil assessments during the school year. A school, at its
discretion, may allow pupils in grades 9 through 12 to participate in interim assessments;
   (2) a system of scientific, research-based instruction and intervention; and
    (3) an organizational plan that allows teachers, paraprofessionals, and volunteers funded
through various sources to work as a grade-level team or use another configuration across grades
and settings to deliver instruction. The team must be trained in scientific, research-based instruction
and intervention. Teachers and paraprofessionals at a site operating under this paragraph must work
collaboratively with those pupils who need additional academic or behavioral support to succeed
in a general education environment.
    (b) As an intervention under paragraph (a), clause (2), staff generating special education aid
under section 125A.76 may provide small group instruction to pupils who need additional academic
or behavioral support to succeed in the general education environment. Small group instruction
that includes pupils with a disability may be provided in the general education environment if the
needs of the pupils with a disability are met, consistent with their individual education plans, and
all pupils in the group receive the same level of instruction and make the same progress in the
instruction or intervention. Teachers and paraprofessionals must ensure that the needs of pupils with
a disability participating in small group instruction under this paragraph remain the focus of the
instruction. Expenditures attributable to the time special education staff spends providing instruction
to nondisabled pupils in this circumstance is eligible for special education aid under section 125A.76
as an incidental benefit if:
   (1) the group consists primarily of disabled pupils;
   (2) no special education staff are added to meet nondisabled pupils' needs; and
   (3) the primary purpose of the instruction is to implement the individual education plans of pupils

   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 43A.23, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) The commissioner is authorized to request bids and to enter into
contracts with parties which in the judgment of the commissioner are best qualified to provide
service to the benefit plans. Contracts entered into are not subject to the requirements of sections
16C.16 to 16C.19. The commissioner may negotiate premium rates and coverage. Contracts to
underwrite the benefit plans must be bid or negotiated separately from contracts to service the benefit
plans, which may be awarded only on the basis of competitive bids. The commissioner shall consider
the cost of the plans, conversion options relating to the contracts, service capabilities, character,
financial position, and reputation of the carriers, and any other factors which the commissioner
deems appropriate. Each benefit contract must be for a uniform term of at least one year, but may be
made automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of notice of termination by either
party. A carrier licensed under chapter 62A is exempt from the taxes imposed by chapter 297I on
premiums paid to it by the state.
    (b) All self-insured hospital and medical service products must comply with coverage
mandates, data reporting, and consumer protection requirements applicable to the licensed carrier
administering the product, had the product been insured, including chapters 62J, 62M, and 62Q.
Any self-insured products that limit coverage to a network of providers or provide different levels
of coverage between network and nonnetwork providers shall comply with section 62D.123 and
geographic access standards for health maintenance organizations adopted by the commissioner of
health in rule under chapter 62D.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a self-insured hospital and medical product offered under
sections 43A.22 to 43A.30 is not required to extend dependent coverage to an eligible employee's
unmarried child under the age of 25 to the full extent required under chapters 62A and 62L.
Dependent coverage must, at a minimum, extend to an eligible employee's unmarried child who
is under the age of 19 or an unmarried child under the age of 25 who is a full-time student. The
definition of "full-time student" for purposes of this paragraph includes any student who by reason
of illness, injury, or physical or mental disability as documented by a physician is unable to carry
what the educational institution considers a full-time course load so long as the student's course
load is at least 60 percent of what otherwise is considered by the institution to be a full-time course
load. Any notice regarding termination of coverage due to attainment of the limiting age must
include information about this definition of "full-time student."
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2008."

Minnesota Early Learning Foundation quality rating system administered by the Department of
Human Services and agrees to accept a prekindergarten education allowance to pay for services.
For fiscal years 2008 and 2009 only, a provider may satisfy the quality rating system requirements
and be deemed eligible to participate in this program if the provider has received a provisional
quality rating system approval from either the Department of Human Services or the Department
of Education.
    (b) For the purposes of receiving a provisional quality rating, a child care program or provider
must be approved by the commissioner of human services and a school readiness program or a Head
Start program must be approved by the commissioner of education. Programs and providers must
apply for approval in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioners. To receive approval,
the commissioners must determine that applicants:

provided.
    (e) For fiscal years 2008 and 2009 only, when no quality program is available, a recipient may
direct the prekindergarten education allowance to a provider or program for school readiness quality
improvements that will make the provider or program eligible for a quality rating according to the
quality rating system. Allowable expenditures that will increase the capacity of the provider or
program to help children be ready for school include purchase of curricula and assessment tools,
training on the use of curriculum and assessment tools, purchase of materials to improve the learning
environment, or other expenditures approved by the commissioner of human services for child care
providers and the commissioner of education for school readiness programs.

477A.03 after the subtraction under section 477A.014, subdivisions 4 and 5.

by more than 25 percent from its net tax capacity in the previous year due to property becoming
tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (b) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for aids payable in 2008 and thereafter.

    Subdivision 1. General distribution. Except as provided in subdivision 2 or in section 97A.061,
subdivision 5, 40 percent of the total payment to the county shall be deposited in the county general
revenue fund to be used to provide property tax levy reduction. The remainder shall be distributed
by the county in the following priority:
    (a) 37.5 cents, as adjusted for inflation under section 477A.145, for each acre of
county-administered other natural resources land shall be deposited in a resource development
fund to be created within the county treasury for use in resource development, forest management,
game and fish habitat improvement, and recreational development and maintenance of
county-administered other natural resources land. Any county receiving less than $5,000 annually
for the resource development fund may elect to deposit that amount in the county general revenue
fund;
    (b) From the funds remaining, within 30 days of receipt of the payment to the county, the
county treasurer shall pay each organized township 30 cents, as adjusted for inflation under section
477A.145, for each acre of acquired natural resources land, each acre of land utilization project
land located entirely within a wildlife management area, and each acre of land described in section
477A.12, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and 7.5 cents, as adjusted for inflation under section
477A.145, for each acre of other natural resources land and each acre of land utilization project
land not located within a wildlife management area, located within its boundaries. Payments for
natural resources lands not located in an organized township shall be deposited in the county
general revenue fund. Payments to counties and townships pursuant to this paragraph shall be used
to provide property tax levy reduction, except that of the payments for natural resources lands not
located in an organized township, the county may allocate the amount determined to be necessary
for maintenance of roads in unorganized townships. Provided that, if the total payment to the
county pursuant to section 477A.12 is not sufficient to fully fund the distribution provided for
in this clause, the amount available shall be distributed to each township and the county general
revenue fund on a pro rata basis; and
     (c) Any remaining funds shall be deposited in the county general revenue fund. Provided that,
if the distribution to the county general revenue fund exceeds $35,000, the excess shall be used to
provide property tax levy reduction.

taxes on the land received in the year. Payment of a town's or a school district's allocation must be
made by the county treasurer to the town or school district within 30 days of receipt of the payment
to the county. The county's share of the payment shall be deposited in the county general revenue

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.41, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Retired employee health benefits. A district may levy an amount up to the amount the
district is required by the collective bargaining agreement in effect on March 30, 1992, to pay for
health insurance or unreimbursed medical expenses for licensed and nonlicensed employees who
have terminated services in the employing district and withdrawn from active teaching service or
other active service, as applicable, before July 1, 1992, or in the case of a school district located
within the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134, before July 1, 1998, if a sunset clause
is in effect for the current collective bargaining agreement. The total amount of the levy each year
may not exceed $600,000.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2008 and thereafter.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 127A.48, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Methodology. In making its annual assessment/sales ratio studies, the Department
of Revenue must use a methodology consistent with the most recent Standard on Assessment
Ratio Studies published by the assessment standards committee of the International Association
of Assessing Officers. The commissioner of revenue shall supplement this general methodology
with specific procedures necessary for execution of the study in accordance with other Minnesota
laws impacting the assessment/sales ratio study. The commissioner shall document these specific
procedures in writing and shall publish the procedures in the State Register, but these procedures
will not be considered "rules" pursuant to the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act. When
property is sold and the purchaser changes its use in a manner that would result in a change of
classification of the property, the assessment sales ratio study under this subdivision must take into
account that changed classification as soon as practicable. A change in status from homestead to
nonhomestead or from nonhomestead to homestead is not a change under this subdivision. For
purposes of this section, sections 270.12, subdivision 2, clause (8), and 278.05, subdivision 4,
the commissioner of revenue shall exclude from the assessment/sales ratio study the sale of any
nonagricultural property which does not contain an improvement, if (1) the statutory basis on
which the property's taxable value as most recently assessed is less than market value as defined
in section 273.11, or (2) the property has undergone significant physical change or a change of use
since the most recent assessment.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

compensation, and (3) it is located in the Minneapolis and St. Paul standard metropolitan statistical
area as determined by the 2000 federal census or in a city outside the Minneapolis and St. Paul

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 272.115, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Requirement. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision 5, whenever any real
estate is sold for a consideration in excess of $1,000, whether by warranty deed, quitclaim deed,
contract for deed or any other method of sale, the grantor, grantee or the legal agent of either shall
file a certificate of value with the county auditor in the county in which the property is located
when the deed or other document is presented for recording. Contract for deeds are subject to
recording under section 507.235, subdivision 1. Value shall, in the case of any deed not a gift,
be the amount of the full actual consideration thereof, paid or to be paid, including the amount
of any lien or liens assumed. The items and value of personal property transferred with the real
property must be listed and deducted from the sale price. The certificate of value shall include the
classification to which the property belongs for the purpose of determining the fair market value
of the property, and shall include any proposed change in use of the property known to the person
filing the certificate that could change the classification of the property. The certificate shall include
financing terms and conditions of the sale which are necessary to determine the actual, present
value of the sale price for purposes of the sales ratio study. If the property is being acquired as
part of a like-kind exchange under section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
through December 31, 2006, that must be indicated on the certificate. The commissioner of revenue
shall promulgate administrative rules specifying the financing terms and conditions which must
be included on the certificate. Pursuant to the authority of the commissioner of revenue in section
270C.306, the certificate of value must include the Social Security number or the federal employer
identification number of the grantors and grantees. The identification numbers of the grantors and
grantees are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivisions
9 and 12, but, notwithstanding that section, the private or nonpublic data may be disclosed to the
commissioner of revenue for purposes of tax administration. The information required to be shown
on the certificate of value is limited to the information required as of the date of the acknowledgment
on the deed or other document to be recorded.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for certificates filed after June 30, 2007.

    In this subdivision, "total production income" means gross income as reported for federal income
tax purposes on Schedule F for the calendar year ending in the year preceding the assessment year,
plus rental income from the property.
   Slough, wasteland, and woodland contiguous to or surrounded by land that is entitled to
valuation and tax deferment under this section is considered to be in agricultural use if under the
same ownership and management.
    (b) Property that qualified under this section for the 2007 assessment shall not be disqualified
in any of the assessment years 2008 to 2012 because of a failure to meet the requirements of this
section.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2008, payable in 2009 and
thereafter, provided that property that qualified under Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, for
the 2007 assessment shall not be disqualified in any of the assessment years 2008 to 2012 because
of a failure to meet the requirements of this section.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 16. Agricultural value determination. (a) In order to account for the presence of
nonagricultural influences that may affect the sales of agricultural land, the commissioner of
revenue shall develop a fair and uniform method of determining, for each county in the state, an
agricultural value that is consistent with subdivision 4. The commissioner shall annually assign the
resulting agricultural value to each county, and this value shall be used as the agricultural value
for the county under this section.
    (b) When property classified as agricultural is sold and the purchaser changes its use in a
manner that would result in a change of classification of the property, and the sale price exceeds the
agricultural value determined under paragraph (a), the assessor and the commissioner must review
the sale along with other appropriate sales information to determine if there are nonagricultural
influences on the value. If upon review it is determined that nonagricultural factors have affected
the value, the resulting sales ratio shall be excluded from use in any study measuring agricultural
value and applied to a study measuring market value.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2009, payable in 2010 and
thereafter.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 17. Implementation of program. This section must be applied to eligible properties by
all county assessors, beginning no later than assessments for taxes levied in 2008, payable in 2009,
and thereafter, unless the commissioner of revenue determines that a county is unable to comply
with this requirement, in which case the county must implement it for the earliest assessment year
determined by the commissioner to be feasible.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 18. Applications; denied by county. For applications filed for the 2007 and 2008
assessment years, all applications for deferment of taxes and assessment under this section that
have been denied by the county shall be forwarded to the commissioner of revenue by the county
assessor within 30 days of denial. The assessor shall also provide the commissioner with a list

of any property owners that requested an application and were denied, including names and
addresses, and the reason for the denial. For the purpose of monitoring compliance with this
section, the commissioner shall compile a report identifying all denied applications and requests
for applications that were denied, the reason for the denial, and any commissioner action or
recommendation. A report must be submitted to the chairs of the house and senate tax committees
on or before February 1, 2008, and February 1, 2009, in compliance with Minnesota Statutes,
sections 3.195 and 3.197.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.123, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Local option; other property. The owner of homestead property not qualifying for an
adjustment in valuation pursuant to subdivisions 1 to 5 or of nonhomestead property may receive a
reduction in the amount of taxes payable on the property for the year in which the destruction occurs
and in the following year if:
    (a) 50 percent or more of the homestead dwelling or other structure, as established by the county
assessor, is:
   (1) unintentionally or accidentally destroyed, or
   (2) destroyed by arson or vandalism, by someone other than the owner,
and the homestead is uninhabitable or the other structure is not usable;
    (b) the owner of the property makes written application to the county assessor as soon as practical
after the damage has occurred; and
   (c) the owner of the property makes written application to the county board.
    The county board may grant a reduction in the amount of property tax which the owner must
pay on the qualifying property in the year of destruction and in the following year. Any reduction
in the amount of tax payable which is authorized by county board action shall be calculated based
upon the number of months that the home is uninhabitable or the other structure is unusable. The
amount of net tax due from the taxpayer shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of months the dwelling was occupied by that taxpayer, or the number of months the
other structure was used by the taxpayer, and the denominator of which is 12. For purposes of this
subdivision, if a structure is occupied or used for a fraction of a month, it is considered a month. "Net
tax" is defined as the amount of tax after the subtraction of all of the state paid property tax credits.
If application is made following payment of all property taxes due for the year of destruction, the
amount of the reduction granted by the county board shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the county
treasurer as soon as practical.
   Any reductions or refunds approved by the county board shall not be subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue.
   The county board may levy in the following year the amount of tax dollars lost to the county
government as a result of the reductions granted pursuant to this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for destruction that occurs in calendar year 2006
and thereafter.

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Agricultural homesteads; special provisions. (a) Real estate of less than ten acres
that is the homestead of its owner must be classified as class 2a under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a), if:
   (1) the parcel on which the house is located is contiguous on at least two sides to (i) agricultural
land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause
(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this
paragraph for the 1998 assessment.

(i) shall be classified as part of the owner's agricultural homestead, if that property is also used for
noncommercial storage or drying of agricultural crops.
    (c) Noncontiguous land shall be included as part of a homestead under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), only if the homestead is classified as class 2a and the detached land

thereof from the homestead. Any taxpayer of these noncontiguous lands must notify the county
assessor that the noncontiguous land is part of the taxpayer's homestead, and, if the homestead is
located in another county, the taxpayer must also notify the assessor of the other county.
    (d) Agricultural land used for purposes of a homestead and actively farmed by a person holding
a vested remainder interest in it must be classified as a homestead under section 273.13, subdivision

purposes of a homestead by persons holding vested remainder interests who are actively engaged
in farming the property, and up to one acre of the land surrounding each homestead and reasonably
necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home, must also be assessed class 2a.

assessment year as existed for the 1997 assessment year and continue to be used for agricultural
purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 30 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 1997 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the
change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural

seasonal residential occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial purposes
for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes a portion
used as a homestead by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead by a
shareholder of a corporation that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the resort, or a
member of a limited liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the homestead is held
by the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of this clause, property
is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property, excluding the
portion used exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy and a fee is charged for
residential occupancy. Class 1c property must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is
defined as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped
with water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class 1c property must provide
recreational activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles,
downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch services, or guide
services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the property is transferred
to an individual or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no longer qualifies for
class 1c even though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered for rent by a property
that otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of the rental agreement,
as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. The portion of the property used
as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the property is classified

used for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products, but not including land used
for agricultural purposes, provided that the presence of a minor, ancillary nonresidential structure
does not disqualify property from classification under this clause, (2) real estate that is nonhomestead
agricultural land; or н     (4
                             нн ) (3) a landing area or public access area of a privately owned public use
airport. Class 2b property has a net class rate of one percent of market value, except that property
described in clause (1) has a net class rate of .65 percent if it consists of no more than 1,920 acres
and is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the requirements of chapter 290C,
but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management incentive program, provided that
the owner of the property must apply to the assessor annually to receive the reduced class rate and
provide the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies for the reduced
rate.
    (c) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more,
used during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this
section means the raising or cultivation of agricultural products. "Agricultural purposes" also
includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535
or the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 if the property
was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the
year prior to its enrollment. Contiguous acreage on the same parcel, or contiguous acreage on an
immediately adjacent parcel under the same ownership, may also qualify as agricultural land, but
only if it is pasture, timber, waste, unusable wild land, or land included in state or federal farm
programs. Agricultural classification for property shall be determined excluding the house, garage,
and immediately surrounding one acre of land, and shall not be based upon the market value of any
residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.
    (d) Real estate, excluding the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one acre of land, of
less than ten acres which is exclusively and intensively used for raising or cultivating agricultural
products, shall be considered as agricultural land.
   Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
    Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
    (e) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or

cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (f) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (g) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), a privately owned public use
airport must be licensed as a public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of paragraph (b),
clause (4), "landing area" means that part of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared,
regularly maintained, and made available to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways,
taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area
also includes land underlying both the primary surface and the approach surfaces that comply with
all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;

    (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
    (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under paragraph (b), clause (4), must be described and certified
by the commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the
airport or landing area no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (4). For purposes
of paragraph (b), clause (4), "public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp,
apron, or storage hangar, or an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2007, payable in 2008, and
thereafter.
    Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
    Subd. 24. Class 3. (a) Commercial and industrial property and utility real and personal property
is class 3a.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided, each parcel of commercial, industrial, or utility real property
has a class rate of 1.5 percent of the first tier of market value, and 2.0 percent of the remaining market
value. In the case of contiguous parcels of property owned by the same person or entity, only the
value equal to the first-tier value of the contiguous parcels qualifies for the reduced class rate, except
that contiguous parcels owned by the same person or entity shall be eligible for the first-tier value
class rate on each separate business operated by the owner of the property, provided the business
is housed in a separate structure. For the purposes of this subdivision, the first tier means the first
$150,000 of market value. Real property owned in fee by a utility for transmission line right-of-way
shall be classified at the class rate for the higher tier.
    For purposes of this subdivision, parcels are considered to be contiguous even if they are
separated from each other by a road, street, waterway, or other similar intervening type of property.
Connections between parcels that consist of power lines or pipelines do not cause the parcels to
be contiguous. Property owners who have contiguous parcels of property that constitute separate
businesses that may qualify for the first-tier class rate shall notify the assessor by July 1, for
treatment beginning in the following taxes payable year.

clause (1), real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreation purposes, including real and personal property devoted to temporary and seasonal
residential occupancy for recreation purposes and not devoted to commercial purposes for more
than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment. For purposes of this clause, property
is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the property is used
for residential occupancy, and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 4c property
must contain three or more rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium,
townhouse, sleeping room, or individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups
for recreational vehicles. Class 4c property must provide recreational activities such as renting ice
fishing houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide
marina services, launch services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. A camping pad
offered for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 4c is also class 4c regardless of the

order for a property to be classified as class 4c, seasonal residential recreational for commercial
purposes, at least 40 percent of the annual gross lodging receipts related to the property must be
from business conducted during 90 consecutive days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid
bookings by lodging guests during the year must be for periods of at least two consecutive nights;
or (ii) at least 20 percent of the annual gross receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses,
boats and motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina
services, launch services, and guide services, or the sale of bait and fishing tackle. For purposes
of this determination, a paid booking of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings.
Class 4c also includes commercial use real property used exclusively for recreational purposes
in conjunction with class 4c property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy
for recreational purposes, up to a total of two acres, provided the property is not devoted to
commercial recreational use for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment
and is located within two miles of the class 4c property with which it is used. Owners of real and

3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to

as provided in clause (2); and
   (2) for a total (100 percent) and permanent disability, $300,000 of market value is excluded.
    (c) If a disabled veteran qualifying for a valuation exclusion under paragraph (b), clause (2),
predeceases the veteran's spouse, and if upon the death of the veteran the spouse holds the legal or
beneficial title to the homestead and permanently resides there, the exclusion shall carry over to the
benefit of the veteran's spouse until such time as the spouse sells, transfers, or otherwise disposes
of the property.
   (d) In the case of an agricultural homestead, only the portion of the property consisting of the
house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of land qualifies for the valuation exclusion
under this subdivision.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the county board may hold a joint hearing with the
governing bodies of all taxing authorities located wholly or partially within the county that are
required to hold a public hearing under this section, excluding special taxing districts. The primary
purpose of the joint hearing is for taxpayer efficiency by allowing taxpayers to come to a single
public hearing to discuss the budgets and proposed property tax levies of most taxing authorities
that impact the taxes on their property.
   (b) This subdivision applies only to counties located outside the metropolitan area as defined
under section 473.121, subdivision 2. If a city or school district is located partially within the
metropolitan area, that taxing jurisdiction may participate in its nonmetropolitan county's joint

hearing, if it so chooses.
    (c) Upon the adoption of a resolution by the county board to hold a joint public hearing, the
county shall notify each city with a population over 500 and each school district located wholly
or partially within the county of its intention to hold the joint hearing and ask each of the taxing
authorities if it would like to participate. Participation is voluntary, and participation in the joint
hearing is in lieu of the requirement for the governing body to hold a separate public hearing under
subdivision 6. If a participating city or school district is located in more than one county, the hearing
under this subdivision is in lieu of the requirement to hold a separate public hearing if 75 percent
or more of that city or school district's previous year's net tax capacity is in the county where the
hearing is held.
    (d) The initial joint hearing must be held on the first Thursday in December. The county may hold
an additional joint hearing on another date before December 20 if the majority of the participating
taxing authorities want an additional hearing.
    The county board shall obtain a meeting space to hold the joint hearing, preferably at a public
building such as the courthouse, school, or community center. The location shall be as centrally
located within the county as possible. The meeting shall generally be structured in the following
general manner:
   (1) 30 to 60 minutes must be devoted to discussion of the county's budget and levy;
    (2) 30 to 60 minutes must be devoted to discussion of the city's budget and levy, with each city's
discussion held in a separate room, preferably in the same building;
    (3) 30 to 60 minutes must be devoted to discussion of the school district's levy, with each school
district's discussion held in a separate room, preferably in the same building; and
    (4) during the last 30 minutes the governing bodies must reassemble in a joint meeting to
entertain any follow-up questions that have arisen from the separate discussions.
   The county shall attempt to keep the total public hearing to within three hours.
    (e) In lieu of the public advertisement requirement in subdivision 5a, the county shall have a
single advertisement listing the county, each city with a population of over 500, and each school
district participating in the joint public hearing listing. Any taxing authority participating under
this subdivision is exempt from the separate public advertisement requirement under subdivision
5a. The cost of the joint hearing advertisement shall be apportioned in the same manner provided
in subdivision 4. The notice must be published not less than two business days nor more than
six business days before the hearing. The newspaper selected must be one of general interest and
readership in the county, and not one of limited subject matter. The advertisement must appear in
a newspaper that is published at least once per week. The advertisement must be in the following
form:

   The formal adoption of the taxing authority's levy must not be made at the joint public hearing
held under this subdivision. The formal adoption must be made at one of the regularly scheduled
meetings of the taxing authority's governing body. However, the property tax levy amount that is
subsequently adopted cannot exceed the amount shown to taxpayers at the joint public hearing.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for hearings held in 2007 and thereafter.

   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing
authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a particular tax
statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan
special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph (i), must be separately

stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be aggregated except that any
levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake
improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for
that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey
County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under
section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county
levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax
deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the
deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections
270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar
amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of
this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar.
The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be
listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
    (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
   (2) the property's taxable market value after reductions under section 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16;
     (3) the property's gross tax, н cн

Indian tribe may create an airport authority. For purposes of this chapter, "airport authority" means
a governmental entity created pursuant to this section for the purpose of acquiring, establishing,
constructing, maintaining, improving, and operating airports and other air navigation facilities.
   Subd. 2. Process to establish authority. A city that owns an airport by joint resolution together
with other willing governmental units may create an airport authority that is authorized to exercise its

    Subd. 3. Airport authority commission. The powers of the airport authority shall be vested in
the airport authority commissioners. The commission shall consist of at least five commissioners.
Each governmental unit that is a member of the authority shall be represented by at least one
commissioner. If fewer than five governmental units are members of the authority, there must
be two commissioners appointed from each member unit of government. The terms of each
commissioner are three years, provided that the length of the initial appointments must be staggered
so that the terms of approximately one-third of the commissioners expire each calendar year.
    Subd. 4. Appointment of commissioners. The governmental body of each member
governmental unit shall appoint a resident of that governmental unit to be a commissioner of
the airport authority. Upon vacancy of a commissioner prior to the end of a normal term, the
appropriate governmental body shall appoint a commissioner to fill the unexpired term.
    Subd. 5. Compensation; meetings; officers. Commissioners shall receive no compensation for
services, but are entitled to payment for necessary expenses, including travel expenses, incurred in

be taken by the majority vote of not less than a majority of the commissioners present, providing
there is a quorum.
   The commission shall elect a chair, a vice-chair, a secretary, and a treasurer at its organizational
meeting. The authority may hire an executive director, a legal advisor, technical experts, and other
employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require.
    Subd. 6. Process to increase size of authority. An airport authority may be increased in
size by adding additional governmental entities if each of the additional entities and each of the
governmental entities currently included in the existing authority adopt a resolution agreeing to
the size increase.
   Subd. 7. Process to decrease size of authority. An airport authority may be decreased in size if
each of the governmental entities that are members of the authority and the current commissioners
consent to change and make provisions for the retention or disposition of its assets and liabilities.
    Subd. 8. Process to dissolve authority. An airport authority may be dissolved after payment of
all debts and adoption of a joint resolution of the governing bodies of all of the participating units
of government. Before dissolution, the property of the airport authority must be sold, transferred,
or distributed as agreed to by the participating units of government. Any remaining funds must be
distributed to the general funds of the participating units of government in proportion to their relative
shares of the most recent levy under section 360.0427.
   Sec. 39. [360.0427] TAX LEVY MAY BE CERTIFIED BY AN AIRPORT AUTHORITY.

the property from the list of class 4d properties certified to the assessor under Minnesota Statutes,
section 273.128, subdivision 3. Once removed from the list, the property is not eligible for class 4d
classification until it complies with this section and its compliance has been certified to the Housing
Finance Agency by the city. Certification to the Housing Finance Agency must be made by May 15
to be effective for taxes payable in the following year.
   (b) A property is a qualifying property for purposes of this section's requirements if it satisfies
each of the following requirements:
   (1) the city offers a crime-free multihousing program through its city police;
    (2) over the preceding three-year period, the number of police calls to the property exceeded the
city's average number of calls for multiunit rental properties for the period by at least 25 percent,
adjusted for the number of rental units;
    (3) the police department has requested, in writing, the owners or managers of the property to
enroll in the crime-free multihousing program and the owners or managers refused or failed to enroll
within 60 days after the request, or failed to complete phases one and three within 90 days and all
three phases of the program within a one-year time period; and
   (4) the governing body of the city, by resolution, determines the property is a qualifying property
under clauses (1) to (3).
    (c) Calls for police or emergency assistance in response to domestic abuse or medical assistance
shall not be counted toward the number of calls in paragraph (b), clause (2). For purposes of
this section, "domestic abuse" has the meaning given in Minnesota Statutes, section 518B.01,

uniform tax rate to be levied against all taxable properties located within each participating city or
town. The maximum amount that may be levied by all participating cities and towns combined shall
not exceed a total of $200,000 per year. If levied, the tax is in addition to all other taxes permitted
to be levied on the property, including taxes permitted to be levied for cemetery purposes by a
participating city or town. The levy under this section must be disregarded in the calculation of
all other rate or per capita levy limitations imposed by law. One of the cities or towns within the

REIMBURSEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Property tax reduction. The owner of improved property that was destroyed
in the Ham Lake fire in 2007 may apply to the Cook County assessor to receive a reduction in
the amount of taxes payable on the property for 2007 and 2008. The reduction provided under
this section must be granted if 50 percent or more of the homestead dwelling or nonhomestead
structure, as established by the county assessor, has been destroyed by the fire and related effects
and the homestead is uninhabitable or the other structure is not useable. For property that meets the
requirements of this section, the tax liabilities for the second half of property taxes due in October
2007 and for all property taxes due in 2008 are reduced to zero. If application is made following
payment of all property taxes due for 2007, the amount of the reduction shall be refunded to the
taxpayer by the county treasurer as soon as practical. A reduction granted under this section is in
lieu of a reduction under Minnesota Statutes, section 273.123. The property owner must apply by
April 15, 2008, to be eligible for a reduction under this section.
    Subd. 2. State reimbursement. The Cook County auditor shall calculate the taxes payable in
2008 based on the assessment made on January 2, 2007, prior to granting the reduction provided
in subdivision 1, and the reduction shall apply to the computed tax. When practical, the auditor
shall identify the reduction on the tax statement sent to eligible properties. The difference between
the computed tax and the tax after the reduction, for both taxes payable in 2007 and 2008, shall
be certified by the county auditor to the commissioner of revenue in a manner prescribed by the
commissioner. The commissioner shall make the payments to the county auditor for settlement to
the taxing jurisdictions containing the property for the second half of 2007 payments and for both
2008 payments in the same proportion that the ad valorem tax is distributed.
   Subd. 3. Computation of credits. The amounts of the market value homestead credit provided in
Minnesota Statutes, section 273.1384, shall be computed on the tax determined before the reduction
under subdivision 1. For purposes of the property tax refund, property taxes payable, as defined in
Minnesota Statutes, section 290A.03, subdivision 13, must be computed upon the tax determined
under subdivision 1.
    Subd. 4. Appropriation. $500,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner
of revenue to make the payments required by this section. This amount does not cancel, but remains
available until June 30, 2009.

    (10) for certified pollution control facilities placed in service in a taxable year beginning before
December 31, 1986, and for which amortization deductions were elected under section 169 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended through December 31, 1985, the amount of the
amortization deduction allowed in computing federal taxable income for those facilities;
    (11) the amount of any deemed dividend from a foreign operating corporation determined

the amount of the addition to income required by clauses (19), (20), (21), and (22);
    (12) the amount of a partner's pro rata share of net income which does not flow through to the

    (15) 80 percent of the depreciation deduction allowed under section 168(k)(1)(A) and (k)(4)(A)
of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this clause, if the taxpayer has an activity that in the
taxable year generates a deduction for depreciation under section 168(k)(1)(A) and (k)(4)(A) and
the activity generates a loss for the taxable year that the taxpayer is not allowed to claim for the
taxable year, "the depreciation allowed under section 168(k)(1)(A) and (k)(4)(A)" for the taxable
year is limited to excess of the depreciation claimed by the activity under section 168(k)(1)(A)

section 3401(a) and (f) of the Internal Revenue Code is assigned to this state if, and to the extent
that, the work of the employee is performed within it; all other income from such sources is treated

   Severance pay shall be considered income from labor or personal or professional services.
    (2) In the case of an individual who is a nonresident of Minnesota and who is an athlete or
entertainer, income from compensation for labor or personal services performed within this state
shall be determined in the following manner:
    (i) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident
salaried athletic team employee shall be determined by using a fraction in which the denominator
contains the total number of days in which the individual is under a duty to perform for the
employer, and the numerator is the total number of those days spent in Minnesota. For purposes
of this paragraph, off-season training activities, unless conducted at the team's facilities as part of
a team imposed program, are not included in the total number of duty days. Bonuses earned as a
result of play during the regular season or for participation in championship, play-off, or all-star
games must be allocated under the formula. Signing bonuses are not subject to allocation under the
formula if they are not conditional on playing any games for the team, are payable separately from
any other compensation, and are nonrefundable; and
   (ii) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident,

and who is an athlete or entertainer not listed in clause (i), for that person's athletic or entertainment
performance in Minnesota shall be determined by assigning to this state all income from
performances or athletic contests in this state.
    (3) For purposes of this section, amounts received by a nonresident as "retirement income" as
defined in section (b)(1) of the State Income Taxation of Pension Income Act, Public Law 104-95,
are not considered income derived from carrying on a trade or business or from wages or other
compensation for work an employee performed in Minnesota, and are not taxable under this chapter.

   (b) Income or gains from tangible property located in this state that is not employed in the
business of the recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state.
    (c) Income or gains from intangible personal property not employed in the business of the
recipient of the income or gains must be assigned to this state if the recipient of the income or gains
is a resident of this state or is a resident trust or estate.
    Gain on the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original
cost of partnership tangible property in this state to the original cost of partnership tangible
property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. If more than 50 percent of the value of
the partnership's assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest
is allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full
tax period immediately preceding the tax period of the partnership during which the partnership
interest was sold.
   Gain on the sale of goodwill or income from a covenant not to compete that is connected with
a business operating all or partially in Minnesota is allocated to this state to the extent that the
income from the business in the year preceding the year of sale was assignable to Minnesota under
subdivision 3.
    When an employer pays an employee for a covenant not to compete, the income allocated to this
state is in the ratio of the employee's service in Minnesota in the calendar year preceding leaving the
employment of the employer over the total services performed by the employee for the employer in
that year.
    (d) Income from winnings on a bet made by an individual while in Minnesota is assigned to this
state. In this paragraph, "bet" has the meaning given in section 609.75, subdivision 2, as limited by
section 609.75, subdivision 3, clauses (1), (2), and (3).
   (e) All items of gross income not covered in paragraphs (a) to (d) and not part of the taxpayer's
income from a trade or business shall be assigned to the taxpayer's domicile.
   (f) For the purposes of this section, working as an employee shall not be considered to be
conducting a trade or business.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.92, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 31. Payments to persons who are not employees. (a) For purposes of this subdivision,
"contractor" means a person carrying on a trade or business described in industry code numbers 23
through 238990 of the North American Industry Classification System.
    (b) A contractor or a third-party bulk filer acting on behalf of a contractor, who makes payments
to an individual, carrying on a trade or business described in paragraph (a) as a sole proprietorship,
must deduct and withhold two percent of the payment as Minnesota withholding tax when the
amount the contractor paid to that individual during the calendar year exceeds $600.
    (c) A payment subject to withholding under this subdivision must be treated as if the payment
were a wage paid by an employer to an employee. The requirements in the definitions of "employee"

taxes imposed on or remitted by businesses located in the enterprise zone, but only if the municipality
determines that the granting of the tax reduction or offset is necessary in order to retain a business
within or attract a business to the zone. The city alternatively may elect to use any portion of the
allocation provided in this paragraph for tax reductions under section 469.1732 or 469.1734.
   (b) The commissioner shall allocate $750,000 for tax reductions under section 469.1732 or

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.174, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Redevelopment district. (a) "Redevelopment district" means a type of tax increment
financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which the authority finds
by resolution that one or more of the following conditions, reasonably distributed throughout the
district, exists:
    (1) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings, streets,
utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures and more than 50 percent of the
buildings, not including outbuildings, are structurally substandard to a degree requiring substantial
renovation or clearance;
    (2) the property consists of vacant, unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used
railyards, rail storage facilities, or excessive or vacated railroad rights-of-way;
    (3) tank facilities, or property whose immediately previous use was for tank facilities, as defined
in section 115C.02, subdivision 15, if the tank facilities:
   (i) have or had a capacity of more than 1,000,000 gallons;
   (ii) are located adjacent to rail facilities; and
   (iii) have been removed or are unused, underused, inappropriately used, or infrequently used; or
   (4) a qualifying disaster area, as defined in subdivision 10b.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "structurally substandard" shall mean containing defects
in structural elements or a combination of deficiencies in essential utilities and facilities, light and
ventilation, fire protection including adequate egress, layout and condition of interior partitions, or
75TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 21, 2007                                          6171

similar factors, which defects or deficiencies are of sufficient total significance to justify substantial
renovation or clearance.
    (c) A building is not structurally substandard if it is in compliance with the building code
applicable to new buildings or could be modified to satisfy the building code at a cost of less than
15 percent of the cost of constructing a new structure of the same square footage and type on
the site. The municipality may find that a building is not disqualified as structurally substandard
under the preceding sentence on the basis of reasonably available evidence, such as the size,
type, and age of the building, the average cost of plumbing, electrical, or structural repairs, or
other similar reliable evidence. The municipality may not make such a determination without an
interior inspection of the property, but need not have an independent, expert appraisal prepared of
the cost of repair and rehabilitation of the building. An interior inspection of the property is not
required, if the municipality finds that (1) the municipality or authority is unable to gain access to
the property after using its best efforts to obtain permission from the party that owns or controls
the property; and (2) the evidence otherwise supports a reasonable conclusion that the building
is structurally substandard. Items of evidence that support such a conclusion include recent fire
or police inspections, on-site property tax appraisals or housing inspections, exterior evidence
of deterioration, or other similar reliable evidence. Written documentation of the findings and
reasons why an interior inspection was not conducted must be made and retained under section
469.175, subdivision 3, clause (1). Failure of a building to be disqualified under the provisions
of this paragraph is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to determining that the building is
substandard.
    (d) A parcel is deemed to be occupied by a structurally substandard building for purposes of the
finding under paragraph (a) or by the improvements described in paragraph (e) if all of the following
conditions are met:
    (1) the parcel was occupied by a substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e),
as the case may be, within three years of the filing of the request for certification of the parcel as
part of the district with the county auditor;
   (2) the substandard building w ннaн
                                     s or the improvements described in paragraph (e) were
demolished or removed by the authority or the demolition or removal was financed by the authority
or was done by a developer under a development agreement with the authority;
    (3) the authority found by resolution before the demolition or removal that the parcel was
occupied by a structurally substandard building or met the requirements of paragraph (e) and that
after demolition and clearance the authority intended to include the parcel within a district; and
    (4) upon filing the request for certification of the tax capacity of the parcel as part of a district,
the authority notifies the county auditor that the original tax capacity of the parcel must be adjusted
as provided by section 469.177, subdivision 1, paragraph (f).
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a parcel is not occupied by buildings, streets, utilities, paved
or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures unless 15 percent of the area of the parcel contains
buildings, streets, utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures.
    (f) For districts consisting of two or more noncontiguous areas, each area must qualify as a
redevelopment district under paragraph (a) to be included in the district, and the entire area of the
district must satisfy paragraph (a).

type of tax increment financing district consisting of a project, or portions of a project, within which
the authority finds by resolution that:
    (1)(i) parcels consisting of 70 percent of the area of the district are occupied by buildings, streets,
utilities, paved or gravel parking lots, or other similar structures; (ii) 20 percent of the buildings are
structurally substandard; and (iii) 30 percent of the other buildings require substantial renovation or
clearance to remove existing conditions such as: inadequate street layout, incompatible uses or land
use relationships, overcrowding of buildings on the land, excessive dwelling unit density, obsolete
buildings not suitable for improvement or conversion, or other identified hazards to the health, safety,
and general well-being of the community; and
    (2) the conditions described in clause (1) are reasonably distributed throughout the geographic
area of the district.

   (1) a statement of objectives of an authority for the improvement of a project;
    (2) a statement as to the development program for the project, including the property within
the project, if any, that the authority intends to acquire, identified by parcel number, identifiable
property name, block, or other appropriate means indicating the area in which the authority intends
to acquire properties;
    (3) a list of any development activities that the plan proposes to take place within the project,
for which contracts have been entered into at the time of the preparation of the plan, including the
names of the parties to the contract, the activity governed by the contract, the cost stated in the
contract, and the expected date of completion of that activity;
   (4) identification or description of the type of any other specific development reasonably
expected to take place within the project, and the date when the development is likely to occur;
   (5) estimates of the following:
    (i) cost of the project, including administrative expenses, except that if part of the cost of the

estimated captured net tax capacity would be available to the taxing jurisdictions without creation
of the district, and for purposes of the second statement, the authority shall assume that none of the
estimated captured net tax capacity would be available to the taxing jurisdictions without creation
of the district or subdistrict;
    (7) identification and description of studies and analyses used to make the determination set
forth in subdivision 3, clause (2); and
      (8) identification of all parcels to be included in the district or any subdistrict.

is made after June 30, 2007.
      Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.175, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Municipality approval. (a) A county auditor shall not certify the original net tax
capacity of a tax increment financing district until the tax increment financing plan proposed for
that district has been approved by the municipality in which the district is located. If an authority
that proposes to establish a tax increment financing district and the municipality are not the same,
the authority shall apply to the municipality in which the district is proposed to be located and shall
obtain the approval of its tax increment financing plan by the municipality before the authority may
use tax increment financing. The municipality shall approve the tax increment financing plan only
after a public hearing thereon after published notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the
municipality at least once not less than ten days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the
hearing. The published notice must include a map of the area of the district from which increments
may be collected and, if the project area includes additional area, a map of the project area in which
the increments may be expended. The hearing may be held before or after the approval or creation
of the project or it may be held in conjunction with a hearing to approve the project.
  (b) Before or at the time of approval of the tax increment financing plan, the municipality shall
make the following findings, and shall set forth in writing the reasons and supporting facts for each
6174                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

determination:
     (1) that the proposed tax increment financing district is a redevelopment district, a renewal or
renovation district, a housing district, a soils condition district, or an economic development district;
if the proposed district is a redevelopment district or a renewal or renovation district, the reasons
and supporting facts for the determination that the district meets the criteria of section 469.174,
subdivision 10, paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), or subdivision 10a, must be documented in writing
and retained and made available to the public by the authority until the district has been terminated;
   (2) that, in the opinion of the municipality:
    (i) the proposed development or redevelopment would not reasonably be expected to occur solely
through private investment within the reasonably foreseeable future; and
    (ii) the increased market value of the site that could reasonably be expected to occur without the
use of tax increment financing would be less than the increase in the market value estimated to result
from the proposed development after subtracting the present value of the projected tax increments
for the maximum duration of the district permitted by the plan. The requirements of this item do not
apply if the district is a н

                                     н housing district;
   (3) that the tax increment financing plan conforms to the general plan for the development or
redevelopment of the municipality as a whole;
    (4) that the tax increment financing plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the
sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the development or redevelopment of the project by
private enterprise;
   (5) that the municipality elects the method of tax increment computation set forth in section
469.177, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), if applicable.
    (c) When the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality shall approve or
disapprove the tax increment financing plan within 60 days of submission by the authority. When
the municipality and the authority are not the same, the municipality may not amend or modify a
tax increment financing plan except as proposed by the authority pursuant to subdivision 4. Once
approved, the determination of the authority to undertake the project through the use of tax increment
financing and the resolution of the governing body shall be conclusive of the findings therein and
of the public need for the financing.
  (d) For a district that is subject to the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (2), item (ii), the
municipality's statement of reasons and supporting facts must include all of the following:
    (1) an estimate of the amount by which the market value of the site will increase without the use
of tax increment financing;
   (2) an estimate of the increase in the market value that will result from the development or
redevelopment to be assisted with tax increment financing; and
   (3) the present value of the projected tax increments for the maximum duration of the district
permitted by the tax increment financing plan.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "site" means the parcels on which the development or
redevelopment to be assisted with tax increment financing will be located.

    Subdivision 1. Duration of tax increment financing districts. (a) Subject to the limitations
contained in subdivisions 1a to 1f, any tax increment financing district as to which bonds are
outstanding, payment for which the tax increment and other revenues have been pledged, shall
remain in existence at least as long as the bonds continue to be outstanding. The municipality may,
at the time of approval of the initial tax increment financing plan, provide for one or both of the
following:
   (1) a shorter maximum duration limit than specified in subdivisions 1a to 1f.
                                                                               н;
   (2) an election as provided under section 469.175, subdivision 1, paragraph (b).
The specified limit applies in place of the otherwise applicable limit, unless the authority modifies
the plan following the procedures under section 469.175, subdivision 4, paragraph (b).
    (b) The tax increment pledged to the payment of the bonds and interest thereon may be
discharged and the tax increment financing district may be terminated if sufficient funds have
been irrevocably deposited in the debt service fund or other escrow account held in trust for all
outstanding bonds to provide for the payment of the bonds at maturity or date of redemption and
interest thereon to the maturity or redemption date.
    (c) For bonds issued pursuant to section 469.178, subdivisions 2 and 3, the full faith and credit
and any taxing powers of the municipality or authority are pledged to the payment of the bonds until
the principal of and interest on the bonds has been paid in full.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for districts for which the request for certification

   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.176, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Excess increments. (a) The authority shall annually determine the amount of excess
increments for a district, if any. This determination must be based on the tax increment financing
plan in effect on December 31 of the year and the increments and other revenues received as of
December 31 of the year. The authority must spend or return the excess increments under paragraph
(c) within nine months after the end of the year.
   (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "excess increments" equals the excess of:
    (1) total increments collected from the district since its certification, reduced by any excess
increments paid under paragraph (c), clause (4), for a prior year, over
    (2) the total costs authorized by the tax increment financing plan to be paid with increments from
the district, reduced, but not below zero, by the sum of:
    (i) the amounts of those authorized costs that have been paid from sources other than tax
increments from the district;
   (ii) revenues, other than tax increments from the district, that are dedicated for or otherwise
6176                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [75TH DAY

required to be used to pay those authorized costs and that the authority has received and that are not
included in item (i);
   (iii) the amount of principal and interest obligations due on outstanding bonds after December
31 of the year and not prepaid under paragraph (c) in a prior year; and
   (iv) increased by the sum of the transfers of increments made under section 469.1763,
subdivision 6, to reduce deficits in other districts made by December 31 of the year.
   (c) The authority shall use excess increment only to do one or more of the following:
   (1) prepay any outstanding bonds;
   (2) discharge the pledge of tax increment for any outstanding bonds;
   (3) pay into an escrow account dedicated to the payment of any outstanding bonds; or
    (4) return the excess amount to the county auditor who shall distribute the excess amount to the
city or town, county, and school district in which the tax increment financing district is located in
direct proportion to their respective local tax rates.
    (d) For purposes of a district for which the request for certification was made prior to August 1,
1979, excess increments equal the amount of increments on hand on December 31, less the principal
and interest obligations due on outstanding bonds or advances, qualifying under subdivision 1c,
clauses (1), (2), (4), and (5), after December 31 of the year and not prepaid under paragraph (c).
    (e) The county auditor must report to the commissioner of education the amount of any excess
tax increment distributed to a school district within 30 days of the distribution.
    (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "outstanding bonds" means bonds which are secured by
increments from the district.
    (g) The state auditor may exempt an authority from reporting the amounts calculated under this
subdivision for a calendar year, if the authority certifies to the auditor in its report that the total
amount authorized by the tax increment plan to be paid with increments from the district exceeds
the sum of the total increments collected for the district for all years by 20 percent.

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.176, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Parcels not includable in districts. (a) The authority may request inclusion in a tax

or a part of a parcel that qualified under the provisions of section 273.111 or 273.112 or chapter 473H
for taxes payable in any of the five calendar years before the filing of the request for certification

made after the day following final enactment, regardless of when the request for certification of the
district was made.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.1763, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Expenditures outside district. (a) For each tax increment financing district, an amount
equal to at least 75 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments paid by properties in the
district must be expended on activities in the district or to pay bonds, to the extent that the proceeds
of the bonds were used to finance activities in the district or to pay, or secure payment of, debt service
on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment districts for which the request for
certification was made after June 30, 1995, the in-district percentage for purposes of the preceding
sentence is 80 percent. Not more than 25 percent of the total revenue derived from tax increments
paid by properties in the district may be expended, through a development fund or otherwise, on
activities outside of the district but within the defined geographic area of the project except to pay,
or secure payment of, debt service on credit enhanced bonds. For districts, other than redevelopment
districts for which the request for certification was made after June 30, 1995, the pooling percentage
for purposes of the preceding sentence is 20 percent. The revenue derived from tax increments for
the district that are expended on costs under section 469.176, subdivision 4h, paragraph (b), may
be deducted first before calculating the percentages that must be expended within and without the
district.
    (b) In the case of a housing district, a housing project, as defined in section 469.174, subdivision
11, is an activity in the district.
    (c) All administrative expenses are for activities outside of the district, except that if the only
expenses for activities outside of the district under this subdivision are for the purposes described
in paragraph (d), administrative expenses will be considered as expenditures for activities in the
district.
    (d) The authority may elect, in the tax increment financing plan for the district, to increase by
up to ten percentage points the permitted amount of expenditures for activities located outside the
geographic area of the district under paragraph (a). As permitted by section 469.176, subdivision
4k, the expenditures, including the permitted expenditures under paragraph (a), need not be made
within the geographic area of the project. Expenditures that meet the requirements of this paragraph
are legally permitted expenditures of the district, notwithstanding section 469.176, subdivisions 4b,
4c, and 4j. To qualify for the increase under this paragraph, the expenditures must:

    (1) be used exclusively to assist housing that meets the requirement for a qualified low-income
building, as that term is used in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (2) not exceed the qualified basis of the housing, as defined under section 42(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code, less the amount of any credit allowed under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code;
and
   (3) be used to:
   (i) acquire and prepare the site of the housing;
   (ii) acquire, construct, or rehabilitate the housing; or
   (iii) make public improvements directly related to the housing.
    (e) For a district created within a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone as defined
in section 469.330, subdivision 6, or for an existing district located within such a zone, tax
increment derived from such a district may be expended outside of the district but within the zone
only for expenditures required for the construction of public infrastructure necessary to support
the activities of the zone, land acquisition, and other redevelopment costs as defined in section
469.176, subdivision 4j. P нuнb lнc

regardless of when the request for certification was made.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.177, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Original net tax capacity. (a) Upon or after adoption of a tax increment financing
plan, the auditor of any county in which the district is situated shall, upon request of the authority,
certify the original net tax capacity of the tax increment financing district and that portion of the
district overlying any subdistrict as described in the tax increment financing plan and shall certify in
each year thereafter the amount by which the original net tax capacity has increased or decreased as
a result of a change in tax exempt status of property within the district and any subdistrict, reduction
or enlargement of the district or changes pursuant to subdivision 4. The auditor shall certify the
amount within 30 days after receipt of the request and sufficient information to identify the parcels
included in the district. The certification relates to the taxes payable year as provided in subdivision
6.
    (b) If the classification under section 273.13 of property located in a district changes to a
classification that has a different assessment ratio, the original net tax capacity of that property
must be redetermined at the time when its use is changed as if the property had originally been
classified in the same class in which it is classified after its use is changed.
    (c) The amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result of previously
tax exempt real property within the district becoming taxable equals the net tax capacity of the
real property as most recently assessed pursuant to section 273.18 or, if that assessment was made
more than one year prior to the date of title transfer rendering the property taxable, the net tax
capacity assessed by the assessor at the time of the transfer. If improvements are made to tax exempt
property after the municipality approves the district and before the parcel becomes taxable, the
assessor shall, at the request of the authority, separately assess the estimated market value of the
6180                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

improvements. If the property becomes taxable, the county auditor shall add to original net tax
capacity, the net tax capacity of the parcel, excluding the separately assessed improvements. If
substantial taxable improvements were made to a parcel after certification of the district and if the
property later becomes tax exempt, in whole or part, as a result of the authority acquiring the property
through foreclosure or exercise of remedies under a lease or other revenue agreement or as a result
of tax forfeiture, the amount to be added to the original net tax capacity of the district as a result
of the property again becoming taxable is the amount of the parcel's value that was included in
original net tax capacity when the parcel was first certified. The amount to be added to the original
net tax capacity of the district as a result of enlargements equals the net tax capacity of the added real
property as most recently certified by the commissioner of revenue as of the date of modification of
the tax increment financing plan pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision 4.
    (d) If the net tax capacity of a property increases because the property no longer qualifies under
the Minnesota Agricultural Property Tax Law, section 273.111; the Minnesota Open Space Property
Tax Law, section 273.112; or the Metropolitan Agricultural Preserves Act, chapter 473H, or because
platted, unimproved property is improved or market value is increased after approval of the plat
under section 273.11, subdivision 14, 14a, or 14b, the increase in net tax capacity must be added to
the original net tax capacity.
    (e) The amount to be subtracted from the original net tax capacity of the district as a result
of previously taxable real property within the district becoming tax exempt, or a reduction in the
geographic area of the district, shall be the amount of original net tax capacity initially attributed
to the property becoming tax exempt or being removed from the district. If the net tax capacity of
property located within the tax increment financing district is reduced by reason of a court-ordered
abatement, stipulation agreement, voluntary abatement made by the assessor or auditor or by order
of the commissioner of revenue, the reduction shall be applied to the original net tax capacity of the
district when the property upon which the abatement is made has not been improved since the date of
certification of the district and to the captured net tax capacity of the district in each year thereafter
when the abatement relates to improvements made after the date of certification. The county auditor
may specify reasonable form and content of the request for certification of the authority and any
modification thereof pursuant to section 469.175, subdivision 4.
    (f) If a parcel of property contained a substandard building or improvements described in section
469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), that w  ннaн

elects to treat the parcel as occupied by a substandard building under section 469.174, subdivision
10, paragraph (b), or by improvements under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (e), the
auditor shall certify the original net tax capacity of the parcel using the greater of (1) the current net
tax capacity of the parcel, or (2) the estimated market value of the parcel for the year in which the
building w ннaн
              s or other improvements were demolished or removed, but applying the class rates for
the current year.
    (g) For a redevelopment district qualifying under section 469.174, subdivision 10, paragraph (a),
clause (4), as a qualified disaster area, the auditor shall certify the value of the land as the original
tax capacity for any parcel in the district that contains a building that suffered substantial damage
as a result of the disaster or emergency.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for requests for certification made after June 30,
2007.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.178, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Interfund loans. The authority or municipality may advance or loan money to finance
expenditures under section 469.176, subdivision 4, from its general fund or any other fund under
which it has legal authority to do so. The loan or advance must be authorized, by resolution of
the governing body or of the authority, whichever has jurisdiction over the fund from which the
advance or loan is made, before money is transferred, advanced, or spent, whichever is earliest. The
resolution may generally grant to the authority the power to make interfund loans under one or more
tax increment financing plans or for one or more districts. The terms and conditions for repayment
of the loan must be provided in writing and include, at a minimum, the principal amount, the interest
rate, and maximum term. The maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged is limited to the
greater of the rates specified under section 270C.40 or 549.09 as of the date the loan or advance is
made, unless the written agreement states that the maximum interest rate will fluctuate as the interest
rates specified under section 270C.40 or 549.09 are from time to time adjusted.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all districts subject to Minnesota Statutes, section 469.178, subdivision 7, regardless of when the

within a tax increment financing district under this section only if the conditions under paragraphs
(b) and (c) are met or if the city elects to exercise the authority under paragraph (d).
   (b) The city has determined that:
    (1) total tax increments from the district, including unspent increments from previous years and
increments transferred under paragraph (c), will be insufficient to pay the amounts due in a year on
preexisting obligations; and
    (2) this insufficiency of increments resulted from the reduction in property tax class rates enacted
in the 1997 and 1998 legislative sessions.
    (c) The city has agreed to transfer any available increments from other tax increment financing
districts in the city to pay the preexisting obligations of the district under section 469.1763,
subdivision 6. This requirement does not apply to any available increments of a н  qu

    (d) If a tax increment financing district does not qualify under paragraphs (b) and (c), the
governing body may elect to establish a special taxing district under this section. If the city elects
to exercise this authority, increments from the tax increment financing district and the proceeds of
the tax imposed under this section may only be used to pay preexisting obligations and reasonable
administrative expenses of the authority for the tax increment financing district. The tax increment
financing district must be decertified when all preexisting obligations have been paid.

districts regardless of when the request for certification was made.

opportunity building zone, the business must notify the local government unit, the commissioner of
employment and economic development, and the city and the county governments from which the
jobs are being or would be relocated. A city or county that objects to the relocation of jobs must file
a copy of the resolution with the commissioner of employment and economic development and the
local unit of government.
    (b) If the governing body of the city or county from which the jobs are being relocated adopts
a qualified resolution objecting to the relocation within 60 days after its receipt of the notice, the
following rules apply until the requirements of paragraph (c) are satisfied:
  (1) if the business has not entered into a business subsidy agreement, the local unit of government
may not enter into a business subsidy agreement with the business; or

    (2) if the local unit of government has entered into a business subsidy agreement with the
business, the business ceases to be a qualified business, effective for the current taxable year, the
current assessment year, and for taxable purchases made after the first day of the month beginning
after the filing of the objecting resolution.
    (c) To be a qualified resolution for purposes of this subdivision, the resolution must identify one
or more sites in the city or county that could serve as an appropriate site for the facility proposed by
the business. To satisfy this requirement a site must:
   (1) be of adequate size;

the provisions of paragraph (b) no longer apply to the business.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
business subsidy agreements entered into after that date.

district using an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the certificates or notes shall
report the amount used for this purpose to the commissioner by July 15 of the following fiscal year.

    (b) A tax or service charge or a combination of them may be imposed to finance a function
or service in the district that the town ordinarily provides throughout the town only to the extent
that there is an increase in the level of the function or service provided in the service district over
that provided throughout the town. In that case, in addition to the townwide tax levy, an amount
necessary to pay for the increase in the level of the function or service may be imposed in the district.

    Subd. 2. Bonds. At any time after the requirements of section 356A.06 have been met and the
subordinate service district created, the town board may issue obligations in an amount it deems
necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making
capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special
services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations are
payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1,
net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter 429. The town
board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the town to ensure payment
of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service charges are
insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance with chapter
475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not included in
determining the net indebtedness of the town under the provisions of any law limiting indebtedness.
    Subd. 3. Covenants to secure obligations. In resolutions authorizing the issuance of general
or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the town board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the town as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the town will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations, and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 365A.095, is amended to read:
   365A.095 PETITION FOR REMOVAL OF DISTRICT; PROCEDURE.
    Subdivision 1. Petition. A petition signed by at least 75 percent of the property owners in the
territory of the subordinate service district requesting the removal of the district may be presented
to the town board. Within 30 days after the town board receives the petition, the town clerk shall
determine the validity of the signatures on the petition. If the requisite number of signatures are
certified as valid, the town board must hold a public hearing on the petitioned matter. Within 30
days after the end of the hearing, the town board must decide whether to discontinue the subordinate
service district, continue as it is, or take some other action with respect to it.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. If obligations have been issued for the benefit of the subordinate service district,
the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, continue until the obligations and any obligations issued to
refund them have been paid in full.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 373.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Capital notes. (a) A county board may, by resolution and without referendum, issue
capital notes subject to the county debt limit to purchase capital equipment useful for county
purposes that has an expected useful life at least equal to the term of the notes. The notes shall
be payable in not more than ten years and shall be issued on terms and in a manner the board
determines. A tax levy shall be made for payment of the principal and interest on the notes, in
accordance with section 475.61, as in the case of bonds.
   (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "capital equipment" means:

Calculation of the limit must be made using the taxable market value for the taxes payable year in
which the obligations are issued and sold. This section does not limit the authority to issue bonds
under any other special or general law.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for bonds issued after June 30, 2007.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 375B.09, is amended to read:
     375B.09 FINANCING.
    Subdivision 1. Budget. (a) Upon adoption of the next annual budget following the creation of a
subordinate service district the county board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for
the operation of the district including, as appropriate, either a property tax levied only on property
within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the service
within the district, or any combination of a property tax and a service charge.
    (b) A tax or service charge or a combination thereof shall not be imposed to finance a function
or service in the subordinate service district which the county generally provides throughout the
county unless an increase in the level of the service is to be supplied in the subordinate service
district in which case, in addition to the countywide tax levy, only an amount necessary to pay for
the increased level of service may be imposed.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. At any time after the requirements of section 375B.07 have been met and the
subordinate service district created, the county board may issue obligations in an amount it deems
necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making
capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special
services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations
shall be payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed pursuant to
subdivision 1, net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter
429. The county board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the county to
ensure payment of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service
charges are insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance
with chapter 475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not
included in determining the net indebtedness of the county under the provisions of any law limiting
indebtedness.

    Subd. 3. Covenants to secure obligations. In resolutions authorizing the issuance of general
or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the county board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the county as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the county will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.
    Subd. 4. Continuance in the event of withdrawal. If obligations have been issued for the benefit
of the subordinate service district, and the district is withdrawn or removed pursuant to either section
375B.10 or 375B.11, the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, in the withdrawn or removed district
must continue until the obligations and any obligations issued to refund them have been paid in full.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 383B.117, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Equipment acquisition; capital notes. The board may, by resolution and without
public referendum, issue capital notes within existing debt limits for the purpose of purchasing
ambulance and other medical equipment, road construction or maintenance equipment, public
safety equipment and other capital equipment having an expected useful life at least equal to the
term of the notes issued. The notes shall be payable in not more than fi  нv
                                                                           ннe ten years and shall
be issued on terms and in a manner as the board determines. The total principal amount of the
notes issued for any fiscal year shall not exceed one percent of the total annual budget for that
year and shall be issued solely for the purchases authorized in this subdivision. A tax levy shall
be made for the payment of the principal and interest on such notes as in the case of bonds. For
purposes of this subdivision, "equipment" includes computer hardware and software, whether
bundled with machinery or equipment or unbundled. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
"medical equipment" includes computer hardware and software and other intellectual property for
use in medical diagnosis, medical procedures, research, record keeping, billing, and other hospital
applications, together with application development services and training related to the use of the
computer hardware and software and other intellectual property, all without regard to their useful
life. For purposes of determining the amount of capital notes which the county may issue in any
year, the budget of the county and Hennepin Healthcare System, Inc. shall be combined and the
notes issuable under this subdivision shall be in addition to obligations issuable under section
373.01, subdivision 3.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 383B.77, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Creation. The Hennepin County Housing and Redevelopment Authority is
created in the county of Hennepin. It shall have all of the powers and duties of a housing and
redevelopment authority under sections 469.001 to 469.047. For the purposes of applying the
municipal housing and redevelopment act to Hennepin County, the county has all of the powers
and duties of a city, the county board has all the powers and duties of a governing body, the chair of
the county board has all of the powers and duties of a mayor, and, notwithstanding section 469.008,
the area of operation includes the area within the territorial boundaries of the county.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. Because the population of Hennepin County is more than 1,000,000,
under Minnesota Statutes, section 645.023, this section is effective without local approval.

    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 383B.77, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Limitation. This section does not limit or restrict any existing housing and
redevelopment authority or prevent a municipality from creating an authority. For purposes of this
subdivision, "housing and redevelopment authority" includes any municipal department, agency,
or authority of the city of Minneapolis which exercises the powers of a housing and redevelopment
authority pursuant to section 469.003 or other law. The county authority shall notify a municipal
authority by January 31 of each year as to the activities the county authority plans to participate in
within the municipality. The municipal authority shall notify the county authority within 45 days
of the date of the notice from the county authority, if the municipal authority does not consent
to the activities of the county authority. T            нhнн

Code.
   Subd. 2. Purpose of trust. The trust established under this section may only be used to pay
postemployment benefits and may be either revocable or irrevocable.
   Subd. 3. Trust administrator. The trust administrator of a trust established under this section
shall be either:
   (1) the Public Employees Retirement Association;
   (2) a bank or banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any state
and authorized by the laws under which it is organized to exercise corporate trust powers; or
    (3) an insurance company or agency qualified to do business in Minnesota which has at least
five years' experience in investment products and services for group retirement benefits and which
has a specialized department dedicated to services for retirement investment products.
   A political subdivision or public entity may, in its discretion and in compliance with any
applicable trust document, change trust administrators and transfer trust assets accordingly.
    Subd. 4. Account maintenance. (a) A political subdivision or other public entity may establish
a trust account to be held under the supervision of the trust administrator for the purposes of this
section. A trust administrator shall establish a separate account for each participating political
subdivision or public entity. The trust administrator may charge participating political subdivisions
and public entities fees for reasonable administrative costs. The amount of any fees charged
by the Public Employees Retirement Association is appropriated to the association from the
account. A trust administrator may establish other reasonable terms and conditions for creation and
maintenance of these accounts.
   (b) The trust administrator must report to the political subdivision or other public entity on the
investment returns of invested trust assets and on all investment fees or costs incurred by the trust.
The annual rates of return, along with investment and administrative fees and costs for the trust,
must be disclosed in the political subdivision's or public entity's annual financial audit in a manner
prescribed by the state auditor.
    (c) Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2009, the trust administrator must
report electronically to the state auditor the portfolio and performance information specified in
section 356.219, subdivision 3, in the manner prescribed by the state auditor.

   (b) The Public Employees Retirement Association must certify all money in the trust accounts for
which it is trust administrator to the State Board of Investment for investment under section 11A.14,
subject to the policies and procedures established by the State Board of Investment. Investment
earnings must be credited to the trust account of the individual political subdivision or public entity.
    (c) A trust administrator, other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, must ensure
that all money in the trust accounts for which it is trust administrator is invested by a registered
investment adviser, a bank investment trust department, or an insurance company or agency
retirement investment department. Investment earnings must be credited to the trust account of the

individual political subdivision or public entity.
    (d) For trust assets invested by the State Board of Investment, the investment restrictions shall
be the same as those generally applicable to the State Board of Investment. For trust assets invested
by a trust administrator other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, the assets may
only be invested in investments authorized under chapter 118A or section 356A.06, subdivision 7,
in the manner specified in the applicable trust document.
   (e) A political subdivision or public entity may provide investment direction to a trust
administrator in compliance with any applicable trust document.
    Subd. 6. Limit on deposit. A political subdivision or public entity may not deposit money in a
trust or trust account created pursuant to this section if the total amount invested by that political
subdivision or public entity would exceed the political subdivision's or public entity's actuarially
determined liabilities for postemployment benefits due to officers and employees, as determined
under the applicable standards of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.
    Subd. 7. Withdrawal of funds and termination of account. (a) For a revocable account,
a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw some or all of its money or terminate the
trust account. Money and accrued investment earnings withdrawn from a revocable account must
be deposited in a fund separate and distinct from any other funds of the political subdivision
or public entity. This money, with accrued investment earnings, must be used to pay legally
enforceable postemployment benefits to former officers and employees, unless (i) there has been a
change in state or federal law affecting that political subdivision's or public entity's liabilities for
postemployment benefits, or (ii) there has been a change in the demographic composition of that
political subdivision's or public entity's employees eligible for postemployment benefits, or (iii)
there has been a change in the provisions or terms of the postemployment benefits in that political
subdivision or public entity including, but not limited to, the portion of the costs eligible employees
must pay to receive the benefits, or (iv) other factors exist that have a material effect on that political
subdivision's or public entity's actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, in
which event any amount in excess of 100 percent of that political subdivision's or public entity's
actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, as determined under standards of
the Government Accounting Standards Board, may be withdrawn and used for any purpose.
   (b) For an irrevocable account, a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw money
only:
    (1) as needed to pay postemployment benefits owed to former officers and employees of the
political subdivision or public entity; or
    (2) when all postemployment benefit liability owed to former officers or employees of the
political subdivision or public entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.
    (c) A political subdivision or public entity requesting withdrawal of money from an account
created under this section must do so at a time and in the manner required by the executive director
of the Public Employees Retirement Association or specified in an applicable trust document. The
political subdivision or public entity that created the trust must ensure that withdrawals comply with
the requirements of this section.

purpose.
    Subd. 8. Status of irrevocable trust. (a) All money in an irrevocable trust or trust account
created in this section is held in trust for the exclusive benefit of former officers and employees of

the state, the participating political subdivision or public entity, the current or former officers and

   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 475.52, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Certain purposes. Any municipality may issue bonds for paying judgments against it;
for refunding outstanding bonds; for funding floating indebtedness; for funding actuarial liabilities
to pay postemployment benefits to employees or officers after their termination of service; or
for funding all or part of the municipality's current and future unfunded liability for a pension or
retirement fund or plan referred to in section 356.20, subdivision 2, as those liabilities are most

   Subd. 2. Authorization. An issuing political subdivision may enter into agreements with any
75TH DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 21, 2007                                            6207

other political subdivision of the state, within or without its jurisdiction, and any state agency, with
respect to federal grants for transportation or transit projects to be received directly or indirectly by or
on behalf of the political subdivision or agency, under an executed grant agreement with the relevant
federal agency. The agreements may provide that the political subdivision or agency will pledge to
the issuing political subdivision all or a specified portion of the federal grants received by or on
behalf of the political subdivision or agency for a specified period of years, or until all obligations
issued by the issuing political subdivision under subdivision 3 with respect to those federal grants
have been paid or legally defeased. If the issuing political subdivision issues obligations under
subdivision 3, the agreements must provide the method by which the proceeds of the obligations
will be used to pay or reimburse the costs of the transportation or transit projects relating to the
federal grants described in the executed federal grant agreement.
    Subd. 3. Issuance of obligations. In anticipation of any federal grants for transportation or transit
projects to be received directly or indirectly by any political subdivision or agency as specified in
subdivision 1, or by an issuing political subdivision with respect to any transportation or transit
projects within its jurisdiction, an issuing political subdivision may issue its obligations payable
from the collections of those federal grants. The obligations may be issued in the principal amount
the issuing political subdivision determines provided that the estimated collections of the federal
grants under the relevant executed federal grant agreement in each year in which the obligations
will be outstanding must be at least equal to:
   (1) if the obligations are to be issued as revenue obligations, 150 percent of the maximum annual
debt service on the obligations; or
   (2) if the obligations are to be issued as general obligations, 110 percent of the maximum annual
debt service on the obligations.
    Except as otherwise provided in this section, the issuing political subdivision shall provide for
the issuance, sale, and security of the obligations as provided in chapter 475, and has the same
powers and duties as a municipality issuing bonds under that law, except that no election is required
and the net debt limitations in chapter 475 do not apply to the obligations. The issuing political
subdivision may determine to issue the obligations as revenue obligations, payable solely from the
collections of the federal grants anticipated, or may pledge its full faith and credit to the payment of
the obligations.
   Subd. 4. Use of proceeds. The proceeds of the obligations must be used:
   (1) to pay or reimburse the costs of the transportation or transit projects relating to the federal
grants being anticipated;
   (2) to pay the costs of issuance of the obligations, including credit enhancement;
    (3) to pay interest on the obligations for a period not exceeding three years from their date of
issue; and
    (4) if the full faith and credit of the issuing political subdivision is not pledged to the payment
of the obligations, to fund a debt service reserve fund for the obligations.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 475.53, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

the question of issuing the obligations, but an election shall not be required to authorize obligations
issued:
    (1) to pay any unpaid judgment against the municipality;
    (2) for refunding obligations;
    (3) for an improvement or improvement program, which obligation is payable wholly or
partly from the proceeds of special assessments levied upon property specially benefited by the
improvement or by an improvement within the improvement program, or from tax increments, as
defined in section 469.174, subdivision 25, including obligations which are the general obligations
of the municipality, if the municipality is entitled to reimbursement in whole or in part from the
proceeds of such special assessments or tax increments and not less than 20 percent of the cost of
the improvement or the improvement program is to be assessed against benefited property or is to
be paid from the proceeds of federal grant funds or a combination thereof, or is estimated to be

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276A.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Commercial-industrial property. "Commercial-industrial property" means the
following categories of property, as defined in section 273.13, excluding that portion of the property
(i) that may, by law, constitute the tax base for a tax increment pledged pursuant to section 469.042
or 469.162 or sections 469.174 to 469.178, certification of which was requested prior to May 1,
1996, to the extent and while the tax increment is so pledged; or (ii) that is exempt from taxation
under section 272.02:
   (1) that portion of class 5 property consisting of unmined iron ore and low-grade iron-bearing
formations as defined in section 273.14, tools, implements, and machinery, except the portion of
high voltage transmission lines, the value of which is deducted from net tax capacity under section
273.425; and
    (2) that portion of class 3 and class 5 property which is either used or zoned for use for any
commercial or industrial purpose, including property that becomes taxable under section 6, except
for such property which is, or, in the case of property under construction, will when completed be
used exclusively for residential occupancy and the provision of services to residential occupants
thereof. Property must be considered as used exclusively for residential occupancy only if each
of not less than 80 percent of its occupied residential units is, or, in the case of property under
construction, will when completed be occupied under an oral or written agreement for occupancy
over a continuous period of not less than 30 days.

   If the classification of property prescribed by section 273.13 is modified by legislative
amendment, the references in this subdivision are to the successor class or classes of property, or
portions thereof, that include the kinds of property designated in this subdivision.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276A.04, is amended to read:
   276A.04 INCREASE IN NET TAX CAPACITY.
    By July 15 of 1997 and each subsequent year, the auditor of each county in the area shall
determine the amount, if any, by which the net tax capacity determined in the preceding year
pursuant to section 276A.03, of commercial-industrial property subject to taxation within each
municipality in the county exceeds the net tax capacity in 1995 of commercial-industrial property
subject to taxation within that municipality, including the total net tax capacity of property that
becomes taxable under section 6. If a municipality is located in two or more counties within
the area, the auditors of those counties shall certify the data required by section 276A.03 to the
county auditor responsible for allocating the levies of that municipality between or among the
affected counties. That county auditor shall determine the amount of the net excess, if any, for the
municipality under this section, and certify that amount under section 276A.05. The increase in
total net tax capacity determined by this section must be reduced by the amount of any decreases
in the net tax capacity of commercial-industrial property resulting from any court decisions,
court-related stipulation agreements, or abatements for a prior year, and only in the amount of such
decreases made during the 12-month period ending on May 1 of the current assessment year, where
the decreases, if originally reflected in the determination of a prior year's net tax capacity under
section 276A.03, would have resulted in a smaller contribution from the municipality in that year.
An adjustment for the decreases shall be made only if the municipality made a contribution in a
prior year based on the higher net tax capacity of the commercial-industrial property.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.22, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Forest trust. The commissioner, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the
members of the board, may purchase forest lands in the taconite assistance area defined in under
section 273.1341 with funds specifically authorized for the purchase. The acquired forest lands
must be held in trust for the benefit of the citizens of the taconite assistance area as the Iron Range
Miners' Memorial Forest. The forest trust lands shall be managed and developed for recreation and
economic development purposes. Proceeds derived from the management of the lands and from
the sale of timber or removal of gravel or other minerals from these forest lands shall be deposited
into an Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest account that is established within the state financial
accounts. Funds may be expended from the account upon approval of a majority of the members
of the board to purchase, manage, administer, convey interests in, and improve the forest lands.
By majority vote of the members of the board, money in the Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest
account may be transferred into the corpus of the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust
fund established under sections 298.291 to 298.294. The property acquired under the authority
granted by this subdivision and income derived from the property or the operation or management
of the property are exempt from taxation by the state or its political subdivisions.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.2214, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Imposed; calculation. (a) For concentrate produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003,
there is imposed upon taconite and iron sulphides, and upon the mining and quarrying thereof, and
upon the production of iron ore concentrate therefrom, and upon the concentrate so produced, a tax
of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced therefrom. For concentrates
produced in 2005, the tax rate is the same rate imposed for concentrates produced in 2004.
    (b) For concentrates produced in 2006 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to the
preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding
year to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. "Implicit price deflator" means the implicit price
deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United
States Department of Commerce.
    (c) On concentrates produced in 1997 and thereafter, an additional tax is imposed equal to three
cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate for each one percent that the iron content
of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
     (d) The tax shall be imposed on the average of the production for the current year and the previous
two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's tax rate. This clause shall not apply
in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property taxes on the facility would be higher
if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable.
    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
    (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore, no tax is imposed under this section. As used in this
paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000 tons of direct reduced ore
in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production" is production of 50,000 tons
75TH DAY]                                                   MONDAY, MAY 21, 2007                                                                                6213

or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is ore that results in a product that
has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of a plant's commercial production of
direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore is 25 percent of the rate otherwise
determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial production year, the rate is 50 percent
of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for the fifth commercial production year,
the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; and for all subsequent
commercial production years, the full rate is imposed.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite or iron sulfides, the
production of taconite or iron sulfides consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state
is not subject to the tax imposed by this section on taconite or iron sulfides.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before July 1, 2008.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.25, is amended to read:
      298.25 TAXES ADDITIONAL TO OCCUPATION TAX; IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES.
      The taxes imposed under section 298.24 shall be in addition to the occupation tax imposed
upon the business of mining and producing iron ore. Except as herein otherwise provided, such
taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon such taconite, iron sulphides, and direct reduced ore or
the lands in which they are contained, or upon the mining or quarrying thereof, or the production
of concentrate or direct reduced ore therefrom, or upon the concentrate or direct reduced ore
produced, or upon the machinery, equipment, tools, supplies and buildings used in such mining,
quarrying or production, or upon the lands occupied by, or used in connection with, such mining,
quarrying or production facilities. If electric or steam power for the mining, transportation or
concentration of such taconite, concentrates or direct reduced ore produced therefrom is generated
in plants principally devoted to the generation of power for such purposes, the plants in which such
power is generated and all machinery, equipment, tools, supplies, transmission and distribution
lines used in the generation and distribution of such power, shall not be considered to be machinery,
equipment, tools, supplies and buildings used in the mining, quarrying, or production of taconite,
taconite concentrates or direct reduced ore within the meaning of this section, and shall be subject
to general property taxation. н                   Iн

materials other than taconite or iron sulphides in such lands in the manner provided by law, nor
the assessment and taxation of facilities used in producing sulphur or sulphur products from iron
sulphide concentrates, or in refining such sulphur products, under the general property tax laws.
Nothing herein shall except from general taxation or from taxation as provided by other laws any
property used for residential or townsite purposes, including utility services thereto. This section
does not provide an exemption from general property taxation for ore docks even if located at the
site of a taconite production facility.

     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.28, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Cities; towns. (a) 12.5 cents per taxable ton, less any amount distributed under
subdivision 8, and paragraph (b), must be allocated to the taconite municipal aid account to be
distributed as provided in section 298.282.
    (b) An amount must be allocated to towns or cities that is annually certified by the county auditor
of a county containing a taconite tax relief area as defined in section 273.134, paragraph (b), within
which there is (1) an organized township if, as of January 2, 1982, more than 75 percent of the
assessed valuation of the township consists of iron ore or (2) a city if, as of January 2, 1980, more
than 75 percent of the assessed valuation of the city consists of iron ore.
    (c) The amount allocated under paragraph (b) will be the portion of a township's or city's certified
levy equal to the proportion of (1) the difference between 50 percent of January 2, 1982, assessed
value in the case of a township and 50 percent of the January 2, 1980, assessed value in the case of
a city and its current assessed value to (2) the sum of its current assessed value plus the difference
determined in (1), provided that the amount distributed shall not exceed $55 per capita in the case
of a township or $75 per capita in the case of a city. For purposes of this limitation, population
will be determined according to the 1980 decennial census conducted by the United States Bureau
of the Census. If the current assessed value of the township exceeds 50 percent of the township's
January 2, 1982, assessed value, or if the current assessed value of the city exceeds 50 percent of the
city's January 2, 1980, assessed value, this paragraph shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph,
"assessed value," when used in reference to years other than 1980 or 1982, means the appropriate
net tax capacities multiplied by 10.2.
    (d) In addition to other distributions under this subdivision, 3 cents per taxable ton must be
allocated for distribution to towns that are entirely located within the taconite tax relief area defined
in section 273.134, paragraph (b). The amount available under this paragraph will be distributed to
eligible towns on a per capita basis.

be distributed to a group of school districts comprised of those school districts which qualify as a
tax relief area under section 273.134, paragraph (b), or in which there is a qualifying municipality as
defined by section 273.134, paragraph (a), in direct proportion to school district indexes as follows:
for each school district, its pupil units determined under section 126C.05 for the prior school year
shall be multiplied by the ratio of the average adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit for school
districts receiving aid under this clause as calculated pursuant to chapters 122A, 126C, and 127A
for the school year ending prior to distribution to the adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit of the
district. Each district shall receive that portion of the distribution which its index bears to the sum
of the indices for all school districts that receive the distributions.
    (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), each school district that receives a distribution under sections
298.018; 298.23 to 298.28, exclusive of any amount received under this clause; 298.34 to 298.39;
298.391 to 298.396; 298.405; or any law imposing a tax on severed mineral values after reduction
for any portion distributed to cities and towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph
(5), that is less than the amount of its levy reduction under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, for the
second year prior to the year of the distribution shall receive a distribution equal to the difference;
the amount necessary to make this payment shall be derived from proportionate reductions in the
initial distribution to other school districts under clause (i).
   (d) Any school district described in paragraph (c) where a levy increase pursuant to section
126C.17, subdivision 9, was authorized by referendum for taxes payable in 2001, shall receive a

distribution of 21.3 cents per ton. Each district shall receive $175 times the pupil units identified in
section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the second previous year or the 1983-1984 school year,
whichever is greater, less the product of 1.8 percent times the district's taxable net tax capacity in
the second previous year.
    If the total amount provided by paragraph (d) is insufficient to make the payments herein required
then the entitlement of $175 per pupil unit shall be reduced uniformly so as not to exceed the
funds available. Any amounts received by a qualifying school district in any fiscal year pursuant
to paragraph (d) shall not be applied to reduce general education aid which the district receives
pursuant to section 126C.13 or the permissible levies of the district. Any amount remaining after
the payments provided in this paragraph shall be paid to the commissioner of Iron Range resources
and rehabilitation who shall deposit the same in the taconite environmental protection fund and the
Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund as provided in subdivision 11.
    Each district receiving money according to this paragraph shall reserve the lesser of the amount
received under this paragraph or $25 times the number of pupil units served in the district. It may
use the money for early childhood programs or for outcome-based learning programs that enhance
the academic quality of the district's curriculum. The outcome-based learning programs must be
approved by the commissioner of education.
    (e) There shall be distributed to any school district the amount which the school district was
entitled to receive under section 298.32 in 1975.
    (f) Effective for the distribution in 2003 only, five percent of the distributions to school districts
under paragraphs (b), (c), and (e); subdivision 6, paragraph (c); subdivision 11; and section 298.225,
shall be distributed to the general fund. The remainder less any portion distributed to cities and
towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph (5), shall be distributed to the Douglas J.
Johnson economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292. Fifty percent of the amount
distributed to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund shall be made available for
expenditure under section 298.293 as governed by section 298.296. Effective in 2003 only, 100
percent of the distributions to school districts under section 477A.15 less any portion distributed
to cities and towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph (5), shall be distributed to the
general fund.

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 297F.21, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Inventory; judicial determination; appeal; disposition of seized property. (a)
Within ten days after the seizure of any alleged contraband, the person making the seizure shall
serve by certified mail an inventory of the property seized on the person from whom the seizure
was made, if known, and on any person known or believed to have any right, title, interest, or lien
in the property, at the last known address, and file a copy with the commissioner. The notice must
include an explanation of the right to demand a judicial forfeiture determination.
    (b) Within 60 days after the date of service of the inventory, which is the date of mailing, the

person from whom the property was seized or any person claiming an interest in the property may
file a demand for a judicial determination of the question as to whether the property was lawfully
subject to seizure and forfeiture. The demand must be in the form of a civil complaint and must be
filed with the court administrator in the county in which the seizure occurred, together with proof of
service of a copy of the complaint on the commissioner of revenue, and the standard filing fee for
civil actions unless the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section 563.01. If the
value of the seized property is $7,500 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court
for recovery of the property. If the value of the seized property is less than $500, the claimant does
not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee.
    (c) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized
property as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges
the property was improperly seized and the plaintiff's interest in the property seized. No responsive
pleading is required of the commissioner, and no court fees may be charged for the commissioner's
appearance in the matter. The proceedings are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure.
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this
section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with an inventory
unless the person has complied with this subdivision. The court shall decide whether the alleged
contraband is contraband, as defined in subdivision 1. The court shall hear the action without a jury
and shall try and determine the issues of fact and law involved.

to be sold at public auction as provided by law.
The person making a sale, after deducting the expense of keeping the property, the fee for seizure,
and the costs of the sale, shall pay all liens according to their priority, which are established as
being bona fide and as existing without the lienor having any notice or knowledge that the property
was being used or was intended to be used for or in connection with the violation. The balance of
the proceeds must be paid 75 percent to the Department of Revenue for deposit as a supplement
to its operating fund or similar fund for official use, and 25 percent to the county attorney or other
prosecuting agency that handled the court proceeding, if there is one, for deposit as a supplement
to its operating fund or similar fund for prosecutorial purposes. If there is no prosecuting authority
involved in the forfeiture, the 25 percent of the proceeds otherwise designated for the prosecuting
authority must be deposited into the general fund.
    (e) If no demand for judicial determination is made, the property seized is considered forfeited
to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the commissioner as provided in the case
of a judgment of forfeiture.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 289A.60, subdivision 27, is amended to read:
    Subd. 27. Reportable transaction understatement. (a) If a taxpayer has a reportable
transaction understatement for any taxable year, an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of
the reportable transaction understatement must be added to the tax.
   (b)(1) For purposes of this subdivision, "reportable transaction understatement" means the
product of:
    (i) the amount of the increase, if any, in taxable income that results from a difference between
the proper tax treatment of an item to which this section applies and the taxpayer's treatment of that
item as shown on the taxpayer's tax return; and
   (ii) the highest rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer under section 290.06 determined without
regard to the understatement.
    (2) For purposes of clause (1)(i), any reduction of the excess of deductions allowed for the
taxable year over gross income for that year, and any reduction in the amount of capital losses which
would, without regard to section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code, be allowed for that year, must
be treated as an increase in taxable income.
   (c) This subdivision applies to any item that is attributable to:
   (1) any listed transaction under section 289A.121; and
    (2) any reportable transaction, other than a listed transaction, if a significant purpose of that
transaction is the avoidance or evasion of federal income tax liability.
    (d) Paragraph (a) applies by substituting "30 percent" for "20 percent" with respect to the portion
of any reportable transaction understatement with respect to which the disclosure requirements of
section 289A.121, subdivision 5, and section 6664(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code are not
met.
    (e)(1) No penalty applies under this subdivision with respect to any portion of a reportable
transaction understatement if the taxpayer shows that there was reasonable cause for the portion
and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to the portion. This paragraph applies only if:
   (i) the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of the item are adequately disclosed as required

under section 289A.121;
   (ii) there is or was substantial authority for the treatment; and
    (iii) the taxpayer reasonably believed that the treatment was more likely than not the proper
treatment.
    (2) A taxpayer who did not adequately disclose under section 289A.121 meets the requirements
of clause (1)(i), if the commissioner abates the penalty imposed by subdivision 26, paragraph (d),
under нsн

                        н subdivision 26, paragraph (g).
    (3) For purposes of clause (1)(iii), a taxpayer is treated as having a reasonable belief with respect
to the tax treatment of an item only if the belief:
     (i) is based on the facts and law that exist when the return of tax which includes the tax treatment
is filed; and
    (ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits of the treatment and does not
take into account the possibility that a return will not be audited, the treatment will not be raised on
audit, or the treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.
   (4) An opinion of a tax advisor may not be relied upon to establish the reasonable belief of a
taxpayer if:
   (i) the tax advisor:
    (A) is a material advisor, as defined in section 289A.121, and participates in the organization,
management, promotion, or sale of the transaction or is related (within the meaning of section 267(b)
or 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) to any person who so participates;
   (B) is compensated directly or indirectly by a material advisor with respect to the transaction;
    (C) has a fee arrangement with respect to the transaction which is contingent on all or part of
the intended tax benefits from the transaction being sustained; or
   (D) has a disqualifying financial interest with respect to the transaction, as determined
under United States Treasury regulations prescribed to implement the provisions of section
6664(d)(3)(B)(ii)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (ii) the opinion:
   (A) is based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions, including assumptions as to future
events;
    (B) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer
or any other person;
   (C) does not identify and consider all relevant facts; or
   (D) fails to meet any other requirement as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe under
federal law.
   (f) The penalty imposed by this subdivision applies in lieu of the penalty imposed under
subdivision 4.

ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2000, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the

amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.

Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the word "1999" shall be substituted for
the word "1992." For 2001, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the
12 months ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2000, and in each
subsequent year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August
31 of the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation
must be rounded to the nearest $10 amount. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to
the nearest $10 amount. The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule
under the Administrative Procedure Act.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2006.

made under section 290.01, subdivision 19e, or Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.09,
subdivision 7, paragraph (c), not previously deducted is a depreciation allowance in the first taxable
year after December 31, 2000.

(17), is allowed as a depreciation deduction in determining alternative minimum taxable income.
    (4) The alternative tax net operating loss deduction under sections 56(a)(4) and 56(d) of the
Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (5) The special rule for certain dividends under section 56(g)(4)(C)(ii) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.
   (6) The special rule for dividends from section 936 companies under section 56(g)(4)(C)(iii)
does not apply.
    (7) The tax preference for depletion under section 57(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code does
not apply.
    (8) The tax preference for intangible drilling costs under section 57(a)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code must be calculated without regard to subparagraph (E) and the subtraction under
section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (4).
   (9) The tax preference for tax exempt interest under section 57(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue
Code does not apply.
   (10) The tax preference for charitable contributions of appreciated property under section
57(a)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply.
   (11) For purposes of calculating the tax preference for accelerated depreciation or amortization
on certain property placed in service before January 1, 1987, under section 57(a)(7) of the Internal
Revenue Code, the deduction allowable for the taxable year is the deduction allowed under section

the Internal Revenue Code, the term "alternative minimum taxable income" as it is used in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, means alternative minimum taxable income as defined in this
subdivision, determined without regard to the adjustment for adjusted current earnings in section
56(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (13) For purposes of determining the amount of adjusted current earnings under section 56(g)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code, no adjustment shall be made under section 56(g)(4) of the Internal
Revenue Code with respect to (i) the amount of foreign dividend gross-up subtracted as provided in
section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause (1), (ii) the amount of refunds of income, excise, or franchise
taxes subtracted as provided in section 290.01, subdivision 19d, clause н  (1

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2006.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.191, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
   Subd. 8. Deposit; definition. (a) "Deposit," as used in subdivision н
                                                                       7 6, paragraph (n), has the
meanings in this subdivision.
    (b) "Deposit" means the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a financial
institution in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit,
either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account
whether or not advance notice is required to withdraw the credited funds, or which is evidenced by
its certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, or certificate of indebtedness, or
other similar name, or a check or draft drawn against a deposit account and certified by the financial
institution, or a letter of credit or a traveler's check on which the financial institution is primarily
liable. However, without limiting the generality of the term "money or its equivalent," any such
account or instrument must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when

either eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes or would have been eligible for a bad
debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the taxpayer were required to file a federal income
tax return, or within one year from the date the taxpayer's federal income tax return is timely filed
claiming the bad debt deduction, whichever period is later. The refund or credit is limited to the
amount of overpayment attributable to the loss. "Bad debt" for purposes of this subdivision, has
the same meaning as that term is used in United States Code, title 26, section 166, except that for
a claim relating to an overpayment of taxes under chapter 297A the following are excluded from
the calculation of bad debt: financing charges or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase
price; uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full
purchase price is paid; expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt; and repossessed property.
For purposes of reporting a payment received on previously claimed bad debt under chapter 297A,
any payments made on a debt or account are applied first proportionally to the taxable price of the
property or service and the sales tax on it, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other
charges.

at the time of the sale of the item to the purchaser; and
     (4) one of the following criteria is met:
    (i) the purchaser presents a coupon, certificate, or other documentation to the seller to claim a
price reduction or discount when the coupon, certificate, or documentation is authorized, distributed,

whom the coupon, certificate, or documentation is presented;
    (ii) the purchaser identifies himself or herself to the seller as a member of a group or organization

     Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 297A.90, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Payment of tax. (a) Persons who are registered as retailers may make purchases in
this state or import property into this state without payment of the sales or use taxes imposed by
this chapter at the time of purchase or importation, if the purchases or importations come within the
provisions of this section and are made in strict compliance with the rules of the commissioner.
    (b) A person described in subdivision 1 may elect to pay directly to the commissioner any sales
or use tax that may be due under this chapter for the acquisition of mobile transportation equipment
and parts and accessories attached or to be attached to such equipment registered under section
168.187.
    (c) The total cost of such equipment and parts and accessories attached or to be attached to such
equipment must be multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the Minnesota mileage
as reported on the current pro rata application provided for in section 168.187 and the denominator
of the fraction is the total mileage reported on the current pro rata registration application. The
amount so determined must be multiplied by the tax rate to obtain the tax due.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning January 2, 2007, for taxes payable in
2008 and thereafter.
    Sec. 5. [270.0725] PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. Penalty for late filing. If an airline company does not file its annual report by the
date designated in section 270.072, subdivision 3, a penalty of five percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company. On August 1, and on the first day of each succeeding calendar month,
an additional five percent penalty is imposed if the report has not yet been filed. For each airline
company, the penalties imposed under this subdivision for any one year are limited to the lesser of
$25,000 or 25 percent of the assessed tax.
    Subd. 2. Penalty for repeated instances of late filing. If there is a pattern of repeated failures
by an airline company to timely file the report required by this section, a penalty of ten percent of
the tax being assessed is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for frivolous report. If an airline company files a frivolous annual report, a
penalty of 25 percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company. A frivolous report under
this section is a report that would fulfill the criteria for a frivolous return under section 289A.60,
subdivision 7, notwithstanding the restriction in section 289A.01. In a proceeding involving the
issue of whether or not an airline company is liable for this penalty, the burden of proof is on the
commissioner.
    Subd. 4. Penalty for fraudulent report. If an airline company files a false or fraudulent annual
report with intent to evade or defeat the tax, a penalty equal to 50 percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 5. Penalties added to tax. Penalties imposed under this section are added to the tax and
collected as a part of it.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for annual reports due on or after July 1, 2007.
    Sec. 6. [270.0735] EXAMINATION; INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS.
    In addition to the powers granted to the commissioner in this chapter, and in order to determine
net tax capacities and issue notices of net tax capacity and tax under sections 270.071 to 270.079,
the commissioner has the powers contained in sections 270C.31 and 270C.32, for which purpose
the word "taxpayer" as defined in section 270C.01 includes an airline company.

licensed assessor or other person employed by an assessment jurisdiction or contracting with an
assessment jurisdiction for the purpose of valuing or classifying property for property tax purposes
is prohibited from making appraisals or analyses, accepting an appraisal assignment, or preparing
an appraisal report as defined in section 82B.02, subdivisions 2 to 5, on any property within the
assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed or performing the duties of the assessor
under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in immediate revocation of the individual's
license to assess property for property tax purposes. This prohibition must not be construed to
prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required for the proper assessment of property
for property tax purposes. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing body of a
governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this prohibition
does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the governmental
unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only allow appraisal
activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, or special assessments.

levied under chapter 275.
    (b) Improvements to real property, and tangible personal property, of an agricultural production

    (d) The exemption applies beginning for the first assessment year after designation of the job
opportunity building zone by the commissioner of employment and economic development. The

of the job opportunity building zone.
    (e) Except for property of a business that was exempt under this subdivision for taxes payable
in 2007, a business must notify the county assessor in writing of eligibility under this subdivision
by July 1 in order to begin receiving the exemption under this subdivision for taxes payable in the

    (c) Land that previously qualified for tax deferment under this section and no longer qualifies
because it is not primarily used for agricultural purposes but would otherwise qualify under
subdivisions 3 and 6 for a period of at least three years will not be required to make payment of
the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land
prior to the expiration of the three-year period requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale
in the year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus
payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years; sale during the second year the land no longer
qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes
for the prior year; and sale during the third year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of
the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to
subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the
end of the three-year period, whichever comes first, all deferred special assessments plus interest
are payable in equal installments spread over the time remaining until the last maturity date of the
bonds issued to finance the improvement for which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have
matured, the deferred special assessments plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions
of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to the collection of these installments. Penalties are not
imposed on any such special assessments if timely paid.

   273.121 VALUATION OF REAL PROPERTY, NOTICE.
    Any county assessor or city assessor having the powers of a county assessor, valuing or
classifying taxable real property shall in each year notify those persons whose property is to be
included on the assessment roll that year if the person's address is known to the assessor, otherwise
the occupant of the property. The notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by ordinary mail at
least ten days before the meeting of the local board of appeal and equalization under section 274.01
or the review process established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c. Upon written request by
the owner of the property, the assessor may send the notice in electronic form or by electronic
mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail. It shall contain: (1) the market value for the current
and prior assessment, (2) the limited market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1a, for the
current and prior assessment, (3) the qualifying amount of any improvements under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, for the current assessment, (4) the market value subject to taxation after subtracting
the amount of any qualifying improvements for the current assessment, (5) the classification of the
property for the current and prior assessment, (6) a note that if the property is homestead and at
least 45 years old, improvements made to the property may be eligible for a valuation exclusion
under section 273.11, subdivision 16, (7) the assessor's office address, and (8) the dates, places,
and times set for the meetings of the local board of appeal and equalization, the review process
established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c, and the county board of appeal and equalization.
The commissioner of revenue shall specify the form of the notice. The assessor shall attach to the
assessment roll a statement that the notices required by this section have been mailed. Any assessor
who is not provided sufficient funds from the assessor's governing body to provide such notices,
may make application to the commissioner of revenue to finance such notices. The commissioner
of revenue shall conduct an investigation and, if satisfied that the assessor does not have the
necessary funds, issue a certification to the commissioner of finance of the amount necessary to
provide such notices. The commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant for such amount and shall
deduct such amount from any state payment to such county or municipality. The necessary funds
to make such payments are hereby appropriated. Failure to receive the notice shall in no way
affect the validity of the assessment, the resulting tax, the procedures of any board of review or
equalization, or the enforcement of delinquent taxes by statutory means.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices required in 2008 and thereafter.

property as reassessed from the market value of the property as assessed under section 273.01 for

    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).

the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.
    The Social Security numbers or affidavits or other proofs of the property owners and spouses
are private data on individuals as defined by section 13.02, subdivision 12, but, notwithstanding
that section, the private data may be disclosed to the commissioner of revenue, or, for purposes
of proceeding under the Revenue Recapture Act to recover personal property taxes owing, to the
county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of the
owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the property
to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The Social
Security number of each relative and spouse of a relative occupying the property н                 anнd

qualifying relative. The commissioner shall use the information provided on the lists as appropriate
under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification
as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite homestead credit under section 273.135,
the residential homestead and agricultural homestead credits under section 273.1384, and the
supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
   (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be

distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
    (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot
determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;

to a city adjacent to a city in another state; and (4) the adjacent city in the other state has a population
of greater than 5,000 and less than 75,000 according to the 1980 decennial census.

provided, however, that in that event, the pipeline shall be assessed in proportion to the percentage
of gas actually transported over such pipeline that is not used for the owner's own consumption.
On or before June 30, the commissioner shall certify to the auditor of each county, the amount of
such personal property assessment against each company in each district in which such property is

   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Ordinary board; meetings, deadlines, grievances. (a) The town board of a
town, or the council or other governing body of a city, is the board of appeal and equalization except
(1) in cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization or (2) in any city or town that has
transferred its local board of review power and duties to the county board as provided in subdivision
3. The county assessor shall fix a day and time when the board or the board of equalization shall meet
in the assessment districts of the county. Notwithstanding any law or city charter to the contrary, a
city board of equalization shall be referred to as a board of appeal and equalization. On or before
February 15 of each year the assessor shall give written notice of the time to the city or town clerk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, the meetings must be held between
April 1 and May 31 each year. The clerk shall give published and posted notice of the meeting at
least ten days before the date of the meeting.
   The board shall meet at the office of the clerk to review the assessment and classification of
75TH DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 21, 2007                                          6289

property in the town or city. No changes in valuation or classification which are intended to correct
errors in judgment by the county assessor may be made by the county assessor after the board
has adjourned in those cities or towns that hold a local board of review; however, corrections of
errors that are merely clerical in nature or changes that extend homestead treatment to property are
permitted after adjournment until the tax extension date for that assessment year. The changes must
be fully documented and maintained in the assessor's office and must be available for review by
any person. A copy of the changes made during this period in those cities or towns that hold a local
board of review must be sent to the county board no later than December 31 of the assessment year.
    (b) The board shall determine whether the taxable property in the town or city has been properly
placed on the list and properly valued by the assessor. If real or personal property has been omitted,
the board shall place it on the list with its market value, and correct the assessment so that each
tract or lot of real property, and each article, parcel, or class of personal property, is entered on the
assessment list at its market value. No assessment of the property of any person may be raised unless
the person has been duly notified of the intent of the board to do so. On application of any person
feeling aggrieved, the board shall review the assessment or classification, or both, and correct it as
appears just. The board may not make an individual market value adjustment or classification change
that would benefit the property if the owner or other person having control over the property has
refused the assessor access to inspect the property and the interior of any buildings or structures as
provided in section 273.20. A board member shall not participate in any actions of the board which
result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by the board member,
the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has a financial interest.
The relationship may be by blood or marriage.
     (c) A local board may reduce assessments upon petition of the taxpayer but the total reductions
must not reduce the aggregate assessment made by the county assessor by more than one percent.
If the total reductions would lower the aggregate assessments made by the county assessor by more
than one percent, none of the adjustments may be made. The assessor shall correct any clerical errors
or double assessments discovered by the board without regard to the one percent limitation.
   (d) A local board does not have authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
    (e) A majority of the members may act at the meeting, and adjourn from day to day until they
finish hearing the cases presented. The assessor shall attend, with the assessment books and papers,
and take part in the proceedings, but must not vote. The county assessor, or an assistant delegated
by the county assessor shall attend the meetings. The board shall list separately, on a form appended
to the assessment book, all omitted property added to the list by the board and all items of property
increased or decreased, with the market value of each item of property, added or changed by the
board, placed opposite the item. The county assessor shall enter all changes made by the board in
the assessment book.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 3, if a person fails to appear in person, by counsel, or by
written communication before the board after being duly notified of the board's intent to raise the
assessment of the property, or if a person feeling aggrieved by an assessment or classification fails to
apply for a review of the assessment or classification, the person may not appear before the county
board of appeal and equalization for a review of the assessment or classification. This paragraph
does not apply if an assessment was made after the local board meeting, as provided in section
6290                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [75TH DAY

273.01, or if the person can establish not having received notice of market value at least five days
before the local board meeting.
    (g) The local board must complete its work and adjourn within 20 days from the time of
convening stated in the notice of the clerk, unless a longer period is approved by the commissioner
of revenue. No action taken after that date is valid. All complaints about an assessment or
classification made after the meeting of the board must be heard and determined by the county
board of equalization. A nonresident may, at any time, before the meeting of the board file written
objections to an assessment or classification with the county assessor. The objections must be
presented to the board at its meeting by the county assessor for its consideration.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.13, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Members; meetings; rules for equalizing assessments. The county
commissioners, or a majority of them, with the county auditor, or, if the auditor cannot be present,
the deputy county auditor, or, if there is no deputy, the court administrator of the district court,
shall form a board for the equalization of the assessment of the property of the county, including
the property of all cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization. This board shall be
referred to as the county board of appeal and equalization. The board shall meet annually, on the
date specified in section 274.14, at the office of the auditor. Each member shall take an oath to
fairly and impartially perform duties as a member. Members shall not participate in any actions of
the board which result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by
the board member, the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother,
sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has
a financial interest. The relationship may be by blood or marriage. The board shall examine and
compare the returns of the assessment of property of the towns or districts, and equalize them so
that each tract or lot of real property and each article or class of personal property is entered on the
assessment list at its market value, subject to the following rules:
    (1) The board shall raise the valuation of each tract or lot of real property which in its opinion is
returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. The board must first give
notice of intention to raise the valuation to the person in whose name it is assessed, if the person is
a resident of the county. The notice must fix a time and place for a hearing.
    (2) The board shall reduce the valuation of each tract or lot which in its opinion is returned above
its market value to the sum believed to be its market value.
    (3) The board shall raise the valuation of each class of personal property which in its opinion
is returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. It shall raise the
aggregate value of the personal property of individuals, firms, or corporations, when it believes that
the aggregate valuation, as returned, is less than the market value of the taxable personal property
possessed by the individuals, firms, or corporations, to the sum it believes to be the market value.
The board must first give notice to the persons of intention to do so. The notice must set a time and
place for a hearing.
    (4) The board shall reduce the valuation of each class of personal property that is returned above
its market value to the sum it believes to be its market value. Upon complaint of a party aggrieved,
the board shall reduce the aggregate valuation of the individual's personal property, or of any class

of personal property for which the individual is assessed, which in its opinion has been assessed at
too large a sum, to the sum it believes was the market value of the individual's personal property of
that class.
    (5) The board must not reduce the aggregate value of all the property of its county, as submitted
to the county board of equalization, with the additions made by the auditor under this chapter, by
more than one percent of its whole valuation. The board may raise the aggregate valuation of real
property, and of each class of personal property, of the county, or of any town or district of the
county, when it believes it is below the market value of the property, or class of property, to the
aggregate amount it believes to be its market value.
    (6) The board shall change the classification of any property which in its opinion is not properly
classified.
   (7) The board does not have the authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 39. [274.135] COUNTY BOARDS; APPEALS AND EQUALIZATION COURSE
AND MEETING REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Handbook for county boards. By no later than January 1, 2009, the
commissioner of revenue must develop a handbook detailing procedures, responsibilities, and
requirements for county boards of appeal and equalization. The handbook must include, but need
not be limited to, the role of the county board in the assessment process, the legal and policy
reasons for fair and impartial appeal and equalization hearings, county board meeting procedures
that foster fair and impartial assessment reviews and other best practices recommendations, quorum
requirements for county boards, and explanations of alternate methods of appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeals and equalization course. Beginning in 2009, and each year thereafter, there
must be at least one member at each meeting of a county board of appeal and equalization who has
attended an appeals and equalization course developed or approved by the commissioner within the
last four years, as certified by the commissioner. The course may be offered in conjunction with a
meeting of the Minnesota Association of Assessment Officers. The course content must include, but
need not be limited to, a review of the handbook developed by the commissioner under subdivision
1.
    Subd. 3. Proof of compliance; transfer of duties. (a) Any county that conducts county boards
of appeal and equalization meetings must provide proof to the commissioner by December 1, 2009,
and each year thereafter, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subdivision 2. Beginning
in 2009, this notice must also verify that there was a quorum of voting members at each meeting
of the board of appeal and equalization in the current year. A county that does not comply with
these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization powers to the
special board of equalization appointed pursuant to section 274.13, subdivision 2, beginning with
the following year's assessment and continuing unless the powers are reinstated under paragraph
(c). A county that does not comply with the requirements of subdivision 2 and has not appointed
a special board of equalization shall appoint a special board of equalization before the following
year's assessment.

    (b) The county shall notify the taxpayers when the board of appeal and equalization for a county
has been transferred to the special board of equalization under this subdivision and, prior to the
meeting time of the special board of equalization, the county shall make available to those taxpayers
a procedure for a review of the assessments, including, but not limited to, open book meetings. This
alternate review process must take place in April and May.
    (c) A county board whose powers are transferred to the special board of equalization under this
subdivision may be reinstated by resolution of the county board and upon proof of compliance with
the requirements of subdivision 2. The resolution and proofs must be provided to the commissioner
by December 1 in order to be effective for the following year's assessment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. In the case of taxing
authorities required to hold a public meeting under subdivision 6, the notice must clearly state that
each taxing authority, including regional library districts established under section 134.201, and
including the metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), but excluding all other special
taxing districts and towns, will hold a public meeting to receive public testimony on the proposed
budget and proposed or final property tax levy, or, in case of a school district, on the current budget
and proposed property tax levy. It must clearly state the time and place of each taxing authority's
meeting, a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions
related to the notice, and an address where comments will be received by mail.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.

    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for the Minneapolis
Library Board and the levy for Minneapolis Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St.
Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under section 134.07 may be listed separately from the
remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal
disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured
value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity subject to the areawide tax must each be stated
separately and not included in the sum of the special taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.

commissioner by September 30 in order for the land to become eligible beginning in the next
year. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner and must include the
information the commissioner deems necessary. At a minimum, the application must show the
following information for the land and the claimant: (i) the claimant's Social Security number or
state or federal business tax registration number and date of birth, (ii) the claimant's address, (iii)
the claimant's signature, (iv) the county's parcel identification numbers for the tax parcels that
completely contain the claimant's forest land that is sought to be enrolled, (v) the number of acres
eligible for enrollment in the program, (vi) the approved plan writer's signature and identification
number, and (vii) proof, in a form specified by the commissioner, that the claimant has executed
and acknowledged in the manner required by law for a deed, and recorded, a covenant that the land
is not and shall not be developed in a manner inconsistent with the requirements and conditions
of this chapter. The covenant shall state in writing that the covenant is binding on the claimant
and the claimant's successor or assignee, and that it runs with the land for a period of not less than
eight years. The commissioner shall specify the form of the covenant and provide copies upon
request. The covenant must include a legal description that encompasses all the forest land that the
claimant wishes to enroll under this section or the certificate of title number for that land if it is
registered land.
   (b) In all cases, the commissioner shall notify the claimant within 90 days after receipt of a
completed application that either the land has or has not been approved for enrollment. A claimant
whose application is denied may appeal the denial as provided in section н  29

      Sec. 51. [290C.13] APPEALS.
     Subdivision 1. Claimant right to reconsideration. A claimant may obtain reconsideration by
the commissioner of a determination removing enrolled land from the sustainable forest incentive
program, a determination denying an application to enroll land in the program, or a denial of part or
all of an incentive payment by filing an administrative appeal under subdivision 4. A claimant cannot
obtain reconsideration under this section if the action taken by the commissioner is the outcome of
an administrative appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeal by claimant. A claimant who wishes to seek administrative review must follow
the procedures in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 3. Notice date. For purposes of this section, the term "notice date" means the date of the
determination removing enrolled land or the date of the notice denying an application to enroll land
or denying part or all of an incentive payment.
    Subd. 4. Time and content for administrative appeal. Within 60 days after the notice date, the
claimant must file a written appeal with the commissioner. The appeal need not be in any particular
form but must contain the following information:

      (1) name and address of the claimant;
    (2) if a corporation, the state of incorporation of the claimant, and the principal place of business
of the corporation;
    (3) the Minnesota or federal business identification number or Social Security number of the
claimant;
      (4) the date;
      (5) the periods involved and the amount of payment involved for each year or period;

      (8) the claimant's signature or signature of the claimant's duly authorized agent.
   Subd. 5. Extensions. When requested in writing and within the time allowed for filing an
administrative appeal, the commissioner may extend the time for filing an appeal for a period not
more than 30 days from the expiration of the 60 days from the notice date.
    Subd. 6. Determination of appeal. On the basis of applicable law and available information,
the commissioner shall determine the validity, if any, in whole or in part, of the appeal and notify the
claimant of the decision. This notice must be in writing and contain the basis for the determination.
    Subd. 7. Agreement determining issues under appeal. When it appears to be in the best
interests of the state, the commissioner may settle the amount of any incentive payments,
payments owed by the claimant under section 290C.11, paragraph (b), penalties, or interest that
the commissioner has under consideration by virtue of an appeal filed under this section. An
agreement must be in writing and signed by the commissioner and the claimant, or the claimant's
representative authorized by the claimant to enter into an agreement. The agreement is final and
conclusive and, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material
fact, the case must not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon.
     Subd. 8. Appeal to Tax Court. Within 60 days after the commissioner denies an appeal, or
within 120 days after the commissioner received a written appeal if the commissioner has not made
a determination in that time, the claimant may appeal to Tax Court under chapter 271 as if the appeal
is from an order of the commissioner.

is not a collection agency as defined by section 332.31, subdivision 3, and is not licensed, bonded,
or regulated by the commissioner of commerce under sections 332.31 to 332.35 or 332.38 to
332.45. The commissioner is subject to section 332.37, except clause (9), (10), (12), or (19). Debts
referred to the commissioner for collection under section 256.9792 may in turn be referred by the
commissioner to the enterprise. An audited financial statement may not be required as a condition
of debt placement with a private agency if the private agency: (1) has errors and omissions coverage
under a professional liability policy in an amount of at least $1,000,000; or (2) has a fidelity bond to
cover actions of its employees, in an amount of at least $100,000. In cases of debts referred under
section 256.9792, the provisions of this chapter and section 256.9792 apply to the extent they are
not in conflict. If they are in conflict, the provisions of section 256.9792 control. For purposes of
this chapter, the referring agency for such debts remains the Department of Human Services.

     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.152, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8. Tax volatility reduction account. (a) A tax volatility reduction account is created in
the general fund.
    (b) Beginning with the November 2007 economic forecast and for each subsequent economic
forecast, the commissioner of finance, in consultation with the commissioner of revenue, shall
estimate the revenue gain or loss anticipated for the current biennium and the next biennium,
as a result of changes in taxpayer behavior in anticipation of (1) the sunset of favorable federal
income tax rates for capital gains income under Public Law 108-27; (2) the extension of the sunset
referenced in (1); or (3) any other federal law that changes federal income tax rates for capital
gains income.
    (c) If the commissioner estimates a revenue gain under paragraph (b) for the current biennium,
and if the amount of gain estimated for the current biennium is more than the amount forecast to
be in the tax volatility reduction account at the close of the current biennium, then the difference is
designated for transfer to the tax volatility reduction account.
    (d) If the commissioner estimates a revenue gain under paragraph (b) for the current biennium,
and if the amount of gain estimated for the current biennium is less than the amount forecast to be
in the tax volatility reduction account at the close of the current biennium, then the difference is
transferred from the tax volatility reduction account to the general fund.
   (e) If the commissioner estimates a revenue loss under paragraph (b) in the current biennium,
then the amount adequate to offset the loss, to the extent it is available, is transferred from the tax
volatility reduction account to the general fund.
     (f) If the commissioner estimates a revenue gain for the next biennium under paragraph (b), and
if the amount of gain estimated for the next biennium is more than the amount forecast to be in the
tax volatility reduction account at the close of the next biennium, then the difference is designated
for transfer to the tax volatility reduction account on the first day of the next biennium.
     (g) If the commissioner estimates a revenue gain for the next biennium under paragraph (b), and
if the amount of gain estimated for the next biennium is less than the amount forecast to be in the
tax volatility reduction account at the close of the next biennium, then the difference is transferred
from the tax volatility reduction account to the general fund on the first day of the next biennium.
    (h) If the commissioner estimates a revenue loss under paragraph (a) in the next biennium, then
the amount adequate to offset the loss, to the extent it is available, is transferred from the tax volatility
reduction account to the general fund on the first day of the next biennium.
   (i) For purposes of this subdivision "economic forecast" means the economic forecast prepared
according to section 16A.103.

chapter 57, article 3, section 34, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Registration or notice filing fee. (a) There shall be a filing fee of $100 for every
application for registration or notice filing. There shall be an additional fee of one-tenth of one
percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to be offered in this
state, and the maximum combined fees shall not exceed $300.
    (b) When an application for registration is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective
stop order is entered under section 80A.13, subdivision 1, all but the $100 filing fee shall be returned.
If an application to register securities is denied, the total of all fees received shall be retained.
      (c) Where a filing is made in connection with a federal covered security under section 18(b)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, there is a fee of $100 for every initial filing. If the filing is made
in connection with redeemable securities issued by an open end management company or unit
investment trust, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, there is an additional annual
fee of 1/20 of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to
be offered in this state during the notice filing period. The fee must be paid at the time of the initial
filing and thereafter in connection with each renewal no later than July 1 of each year and must
be sufficient to cover the shares the issuer expects to sell in this state over the next 12 months.
If during a current notice filing the issuer determines it is likely to sell shares in excess of the
shares for which fees have been paid to the commissioner, the issuer shall submit an amended
notice filing to the commissioner under section 80A.122, subdivision 1, clause (3), together with
a fee of 1/20 of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price of the additional shares.
Shares for which a fee has been paid, but which have not been sold at the time of expiration of
the notice filing, may not be sold unless an additional fee to cover the shares has been paid to the
commissioner as provided in this section and section 80A.122, subdivision 4a. If the filing is made
in connection with redeemable securities issued by such a company or trust, there is no maximum
fee for securities filings made according to this paragraph. If the filing is made in connection with
any other federal covered security under Section 18(b)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, there is an
additional fee of one-tenth of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the
securities are to be offered in this state, and the combined fees shall not exceed $300. B                                                                       ннegннniннnнniнgн

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 80A.65, subdivision 1, as amended by Laws 2007,
chapter 57, article 3, section 35, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Registration or notice filing fee. (a) There shall be a filing fee of $100 for every
application for registration or notice filing. There shall be an additional fee of one-tenth of one
percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to be offered in this
75TH DAY]                                                         MONDAY, MAY 21, 2007                                                                                        6317

state, and the maximum combined fees shall not exceed $300.
    (b) When an application for registration is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective
stop order is entered under section 80A.54, all but the $100 filing fee shall be returned. If an
application to register securities is denied, the total of all fees received shall be retained.
      (c) Where a filing is made in connection with a federal covered security under section 18(b)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, there is a fee of $100 for every initial filing. If the filing is made
in connection with redeemable securities issued by an open end management company or unit
investment trust, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, there is an additional annual
fee of 1/20 of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the securities are to
be offered in this state during the notice filing period. The fee must be paid at the time of the initial
filing and thereafter in connection with each renewal no later than July 1 of each year and must
be sufficient to cover the shares the issuer expects to sell in this state over the next 12 months. If
during a current notice filing the issuer determines it is likely to sell shares in excess of the shares
for which fees have been paid to the administrator, the issuer shall submit an amended notice
filing to the administrator under section 80A.50, together with a fee of 1/20 of one percent of the
maximum aggregate offering price of the additional shares. Shares for which a fee has been paid,
but which have not been sold at the time of expiration of the notice filing, may not be sold unless
an additional fee to cover the shares has been paid to the administrator as provided in this section
and section 80A.50. If the filing is made in connection with redeemable securities issued by such a
company or trust, there is no maximum fee for securities filings made according to this paragraph.
If the filing is made in connection with any other federal covered security under Section 18(b)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, there is an additional fee of one-tenth of one percent of the maximum
aggregate offering price at which the securities are to be offered in this state, and the combined fees
shall not exceed $300. B                     нн egннn

   Senator Bakk moved to amend the Bakk amendment to H.F. No. 2268, the second unofficial
engrossment, as follows:
   Page 83, after line 18, insert:
   "Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 35. Highway fuels tax credit. (a) A credit is allowed against the tax imposed under this
section and section 290.091 to married individuals filing joint returns, surviving spouses as defined
in section 2(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, unmarried individuals qualifying as heads of household
under section 2(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and unmarried individuals who are not claimed
as a dependent on another taxpayer's return and who have attained the age of 18 by the end of the
taxable year. To qualify, the taxpayer's taxable net income for the taxable year must not exceed
the maximum amount that is taxable at the lowest rate under subdivision 2c. The amount of the
credit equals $50 for the taxpayer. For taxpayers with taxable net income that exceeds the amount
of income taxable at the lowest rate under subdivision 2c, the credit amount is zero. For a nonresident
or part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage calculated under section
290.06, subdivision 2c, paragraph (e).
    (b) If the amount of the credit which the taxpayer is eligible to receive under this subdivision
exceeds the taxpayer's liability for tax under this chapter, the commissioner of revenue shall refund
the excess to the taxpayer.
    (c) The amount necessary to pay claims for the refunds authorized under this subdivision is
annually appropriated from the highway user tax distribution fund to the commissioner. The amount
necessary to meet the cost of nonrefundable credits authorized under this subdivision is annually
transferred from the highway user tax distribution fund to the general fund.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective only if an increase in the rate of tax under
Minnesota Statutes, section 296A.07, of at least 5 cents per gallon of gasoline is enacted into law
during the 2007 legislative session. The credit applies for taxable years beginning after December
31, 2006, except for taxable years beginning during calendar year 2007, the credit is $25."

property, but may allow renewal beyond that term upon a determination by the lessor that the lessee

the lessee for its investment in the land and capital improvements. The reimbursement may be paid,
at the option of the lessor and lessee, at the time of nonrenewal without a requirement for a prior
escrow of funds or at a later date and on additional terms agreed to by the lessor and the lessee. A
lease or management contract must be terminable by the contracting public officer or agency if the
other contracting party defaults under the contract or if the governmental program is terminated or
changed, and must provide for program oversight by the contracting public officer or agency. The
expiration or termination of a lease or management agreement does not require that the state bond
proceeds be repaid or that the property be sold, so long as the property continues to be operated
by, or on behalf of, the public officer or agency for the intended governmental program. Money
received by the public officer or agency under the lease or management contract that is not needed
to pay and not authorized to be used to pay operating costs of the property, or to pay the principal,
interest, redemption premiums, and other expenses when due on debt related to the property other
than state bonds, must be:
   (1) paid to the commissioner in the same proportion as the state bond financing is to the total
public debt financing for the property, excluding debt issued by a unit of government for which it
has no financial liability;
    (2) deposited in the state bond fund; and
   (3) used to pay or redeem or defease bonds issued to finance the property in accordance with the
commissioner's order authorizing their issuance.
    The money paid to the commissioner is appropriated for this purpose.
    (c) With the approval of the commissioner, a lease or management contract between a city and a
nonprofit corporation under section 471.191, subdivision 1, need not require the lessee to pay rentals
sufficient to pay the principal, interest, redemption premiums, and other expenses when due with
respect to state bonds issued to acquire and better the facilities.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2006, and applies
to leases, grant agreements, or management agreements entered into on or after that date.
    Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.695, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Sale of property. A public officer or agency shall not sell any state bond financed
property unless the public officer or agency determines by official action that the property is no
longer usable or needed by the public officer or agency to carry out the governmental program for
which it was acquired or constructed, the sale is made as authorized by law, the sale is made for fair
market value, and the sale is approved by the commissioner. If any state bonds issued to purchase
or better the state bond financed property that is sold remain outstanding on the date of sale, the net
proceeds of sale must be applied as follows:

of the grant to the commissioner, and a failure to comply authorizes the commissioner to recover
the outstanding balance as a setoff against any state aid provided to the public officer or agency.
   (b) This section does not create any new authority regarding the ownership, construction,
rehabilitation, use, operation, lease management, or sale of state bond-financed property, or the
operation of the governmental program that will be operated on the property. Any authority that is

   (2) the governmental program that will be operated on the state bond-financed property; and
    (3) that the state bond-financed property must be operated in compliance with this section, all
state and federal laws, and in a manner that will not cause the interest on the state general obligation
bonds to be or become subject to federal income taxation for any reason. A grant agreement must
