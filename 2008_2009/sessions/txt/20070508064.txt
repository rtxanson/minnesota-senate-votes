The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 2089, Chapter 55, the Jobs and Economic Development
Finance omnibus bill.
Without an agreement on the overall total state budget, I am not able to sign this bill as it spends $56
million more than my recommended budget in this area, lacks fairness in distribution of economic
development funding, contains policy items that will have a detrimental impact on business, and
negatively impacts efficient administration of state programs.
64TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2007                                       3723

I strongly encourage the Legislature to pass a jobs and economic development finance bill with the
following provisions and concerns addressed:
In the absence of agreed upon budget targets, the bill needs to be within the limits specified in my
budget request.
The bill needs to include a more equitable statewide distribution of economic development funding.
This can be done by allocating sufficient dollars to recapitalize the Minnesota Investment Fund,
which is the statewide economic development tool.
The removal of unemployment insurance policy language that will increase employer costs by
$10 million the first year and $7 million every year thereafter by allowing certain employees to
collect unemployment while also receiving severance pay.
The removal of language dictating the assignment by geographic area of state OSHA personnel
as this will hinder the ability of the agency to most efficiently administer this program in order to
ensure worker safety statewide.
The removal of policy language eliminating the three citizen members of the Iron Range and
Rehabilitation Board, leaving only the 10 legislative members. This is a policy step backwards,
as consideration should be given to increasing citizen participation as citizens can bring valuable
skills and experience to help conduct the economic development activities of the agency.
I also have concerns with the workforce development fund provisions, the use of the workers'
compensation special compensation fund for equipment purchases, the meatpackers language, and
language regarding the taconite development fund.
The bill eliminates the current law reduction in the workforce development fund enhancement fee
and makes numerous permanent allocations from the workforce development fund. These changes
will raise business costs and the permanent allocations may limit the future ability to use the fund
for its intended purpose of providing benefits to dislocated workers.
The nursing home lifting equipment allocation from the workers' compensation special
compensation fund is more appropriately funded through the general fund. The workers'
compensation fund is for benefit payments to injured workers.
The meatpacker language is duplicative of current federal and state labor laws and sends a negative
signal to this industry that is very important to Greater Minnesota and our agricultural economy.
The taconite economic development language requiring the commissioner to only release tax
rebate funds to taconite producers upon approval of majority of the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board is also a concern. It usurps the IRR commissioner's ability to administer
agency programs.
I commend the Legislature for your work to fund the many important programs contained within
this bill and believe we can come to an acceptable compromise. I encourage the Legislature to
pass the bill without the problem policy items, and with a more equitable distribution of economic
development funding and a more acceptable overall funding level.
My hope is that the Legislature will present comprehensive budget targets soon so that work on this
and other budget bills can proceed in a timely manner. My staff and I look forward to working with

you in that regard.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 56, Senate File 1997.
The basic structure of the bill is flawed. It relies on unrealistic revenue projections to increase
spending beyond sustainable levels, pumps vast amounts of funds into the Legislature's own budget,
and both underfunds and undermines the work of the executive branch.
Even if these provisions were to be fixed, however, I am unable to approve this bill until the
Legislature more fully identifies an overall budget plan. Only in that context can we, and the
public, understand the choices involved in the remaining budget bills.
My budget included an aggressive tax compliance initiative that was estimated to net an increase
of $40 million in revenues. This bill doubles the amount, disregarding the concerns raised by the
Department of Revenue that needed infrastructure and personnel will not be in place fast enough to
generate the revenue projected in the bill.
The bill also uses this unrealistic revenue projection to fund a 19 percent increase in appropriations
to the Legislature. At the same time, the bill eliminates appointed and unclassified employees
throughout the executive branch. The work of these employees is critical in supporting the
Legislature's deliberations and managing the day-to-day operations of state government. I will not
support such a deliberately irresponsible action.
Even with more revenue than I recommended, Senate File 1997 fails to include many key
infrastructure projects. The bill does not provide adequate direct funding for IT security, electronic
licensing, the integrated tax system, or the grants management office. My budget placed a high
priority on technology improvements so we can make Minnesota government more efficient. This
bill misses a tremendous opportunity to invest in Minnesota's infrastructure and improve state
government's ability to better serve its citizens and customers.
I am also disappointed in the language contained in article 2, section 14, that allows appropriations
to continue beyond the end of the fiscal year if the Legislature is unable to complete work on the
budget bills. This language relieves the legislative and executive branches of government from their
duty to pass the legislation necessary to operate government. Extending the deadline 31 days does
nothing to change the dynamic of budget deliberations other than to encourage more delay.
The bill has not removed all of the domestic partner provisions as I have previously requested.
Moreover, a provision remains in the bill which would permit the unlimited expansion of
64TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2007                                         3725

employment benefits to domestic partners and others by local units of government. Again, I am
opposed to any legislation concerning domestic partners benefits, including the bill's study and
definition of "significant individual."
I also have serious concerns regarding the bill's creation of numerous commissions and groups which
duplicate activities already available in state government. The bill expands the work of the Attorney
General's office to include providing assistance to veterans in relation to accessing services. This
duplicates the expertise and services already funded through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The
Commission on Terrorism and Disaster duplicates efforts already undertaken by the Department of
Public Safety and other legislative committees. Similarly, the proposed new Commission on Ethnic
Heritage and New Americans needlessly duplicates and confuses the work of the three other existing
minority councils, which receive almost two million dollars in state general fund appropriations.
Each of these councils have new immigrant representation and statutory duties duplicative of those
proposed for the new commission. These, and other similar provisions, move state government in
exactly the wrong direction at a time when we need to focus our resources to provide services as
efficiently as possible.
I am also concerned that the Legislature has not appropriated specific money to fund these new
commissions and groups, and it is not clear what legislative or agency budgets will be responsible
for doing so. Many of these newly created commissions and groups are given express and unlimited
authority to appoint staff, hire consultants, enter into contracts, and hire experts. Resting such
unlimited spending power in these groups is fiscally imprudent and in some instances raises
separation of powers issues under the Minnesota Constitution.
The provisions in SF 1997 that relate to elections are especially troublesome. Minnesota is known
nationally and globally as a leader in civics and election integrity, as evidenced by our history
of nation-leading voter turnout and same day registration. Most of article 4, however, represents
a substantial departure from Minnesota's current voter registration and election practices. The
changes required by this bill are unnecessary and undermine the overall integrity of our current
nation-leading voter registration and election system. My administration has repeatedly raised
concerns over these election provisions with legislators and the Secretary of State. Unfortunately,
the troubling provisions remain in the bill. My concerns include:
Automatic Voter Registration. This bill would fundamentally alter Minnesota's voter registration
system by creating "automatic" voter registration when applying for a drivers' license, shifting
responsibility from the individual to the government. Under current law, the drivers' license form
allows applicants to apply to register to vote. As part of this process, the individual specifically
affirms each of the criteria for voting and signs the registration form. A person who knowingly
falsifies the registration form is subject to criminal prosecution.
This bill would implement automatic voter registration unless a person applying for a drivers' license
affirmatively opts out of registration. The Secretary of State then assumes the sole responsibility
for determining whether the person is eligible to vote. However, there is no current and reliable
database of information for the government to factually determine whether a person meets all of
the eligibility criteria. Moreover, the process and criteria for obtaining a drivers' license is not the
same as the criteria for voting and the driver's license system is not foolproof. There is significant
anecdotal information that illegal immigrants are able to use falsified documents to obtain drivers'
licenses.
3726                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [64TH DAY

Further, by wholly removing the individual's personal responsibility to certify each element of their
eligibility at the time they register, this bill undermines our current enforcement laws which are
based on those certifications. It will also likely undermine the state's ability to enforce current law
prohibiting people from voting when they are ineligible to do so. Under this bill, the government
will send people who have been "automatically" registered a notice that they have been registered
to vote. A person relying on the government's registration of them as a voter would likely preclude
any individual responsibility for the person voting when they are not eligible. Their defense would
be their reliance upon the government's determination of their eligibility.
Finally, this provision also imposes unnecessary and costly burdens on the Department of Public
Safety's drivers' license system. This approach is a solution in search of a non-existent problem.
Minnesota's current same-day voter registration makes the need for the automatic government
registration of individuals unnecessary.
Online Registration. The bill's online voter registration permits registration without a signature on
the certification of eligibility. The result would be the inability to enforce our current laws which
make it a felony for an individual to knowing register vote when they are not eligible to vote.
Unlimited Expansion of Absentee Voting. This bill significantly expands absentee voting in
Minnesota in a manner that could introduce fraud and unacceptable partisan coercion into
Minnesota elections. Most troubling are the provisions that permit any registered voter to vote by
absentee ballot regardless of their ability to vote at the polling place, coupled with the significantly
expanded use of absentee ballot "agents" who can be designated to obtain, deliver, and help
complete an absentee ballot on behalf of any voter, and the potential creation of electronic ballots.
These provisions move Minnesota in a direction where partisan advocates can go door to door,
present the voter with an absentee ballot, and pressure voters to fill out the ballot and designate
the advocate as an agent to deliver the ballot. The risk of abuse of this system is magnified by the
proposed automatic voter registration system, the repeal of current provisions that require records
of those requesting absentee ballots, and the introduction of absentee ballots being made available
electronically. The bill also allows individuals to vote in our elections despite having never lived
here.
A fundamental aspect of fair elections is that they occur in the open. These provisions do not move
Minnesota in the right direction.
Unrestricted Emergency Powers. Senate File 1997 also grants extraordinary emergency powers to
the Secretary of State in relation to elections. More thorough planning should occur to ensure that
military members are able to exercise their right to vote during a period of deployment. However,
the provisions of this Chapter are not limited to military absentee voting, and are inconsistent with
emergency management laws and procedures applicable under current law or through the courts.
Other provisions are also problematic. For example, this bill repeals a voter complaint system that
complies with the requirements of the federal Help America Vote Act ("HAVA") and replaces it with
a system that does not meet all the minimal criteria set forth in HAVA. The bill also eliminates voting
in the wrong precinct as a violation of election law and removes the current requirement to notify
to the voter of such a violation. Further, it eliminates the conditions for political party balance in
election judges, the recording of those who vouch for others, and unnecessarily extends the period
for purging inactive individuals from the system.
My hope is that the Legislature will present comprehensive budget targets soon so that work on this
64TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2007                                      3727

and other budget bills can proceed in a timely manner. My staff and I look forward to working with
you in that regard.

considers important in determining the level of state appropriations for public postsecondary
education.

    Subd. 5. Bond. (a) No license shall be issued to any school which maintains, conducts, solicits
for, or advertises within the state of Minnesota any program, unless the applicant files with the office
a continuous corporate surety bond written by a company authorized to do business in Minnesota
conditioned upon the faithful performance of all contracts and agreements with students made by

    (b) The amount of the surety bond shall be ten percent of the preceding year's gross income
from student tuition, fees, and other required institutional charges, but in no event less than $10,000
nor greater than $250,000, except that a school may deposit a greater amount at its own discretion.
A school in each annual application for licensure must compute the amount of the surety bond
and verify that the amount of the surety bond complies with this subdivision, unless the school
maintains a surety bond equal to at least $250,000. A school that operates at two or more locations
may combine gross income from student tuition, fees, and other required institutional charges for all
locations for the purpose of determining the annual surety bond requirement. The gross tuition and
fees used to determine the amount of the surety bond required for a school having a license for the
sole purpose of recruiting students in Minnesota shall be only that paid to the school by the students
recruited from Minnesota.
    (c) The bond shall run to the state of Minnesota and to any person who may have a cause of action
against the applicant arising at any time after the bond is filed and before it is canceled for breach
of any contract or agreement made by the applicant with any student. The aggregate liability of the
surety for all breaches of the conditions of the bond shall not exceed the principal sum deposited by
the school under paragraph (b). The surety of any bond may cancel it upon giving 60 days' notice
in writing to the office and shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after
the effective date of cancellation.
    (d) In lieu of bond, the applicant may deposit with the commissioner of finance a sum equal to
the amount of the required surety bond in cash, or securities as may be legally purchased by savings
banks or for trust funds in an aggregate market value equal to the amount of the required surety
bond.
    (e) Failure of a school to post and maintain the required surety bond or deposit under paragraph
(d) m
    ­­a­

    (9) that contracts and agreements do not contain a wage assignment provision or a confession
of judgment clause; and
