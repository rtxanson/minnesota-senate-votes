The Honorable James P. Metzen

The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 3775 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 3775 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. PAINT STEWARDSHIP PILOT PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose. The purpose of the paint stewardship pilot program established under
this section is to allow paint manufacturers to develop and implement a program to collect, transport,
and process postconsumer paint to reduce the costs and environmental impacts of the disposal of
postconsumer paint in Minnesota.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For purposes of sections 1 to 3, the following terms have the meanings
given.
    (a) "Architectural paint" means interior and exterior architectural coatings, including paints and
stains purchased for commercial or homeowner use, but does not include architectural coatings
purchased for industrial or original equipment manufacturer use.
   (b) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency.
   (c) "Cost recovery system" means a system whereby the costs of the paint stewardship pilot
program are included in the final purchase price of the product.
    (d) "Consumer paint stewardship assessment" means the amount charged by the retailer or
distributor on each purchase of architectural paint sold in containers of one quart or larger.
  (e) "Distributor" means a company that has a contractual relationship with one or more
manufacturers to market and sell architectural paint to retailers.
   (f) "Manufacturer" means a manufacturer of architectural paint.
    (g) "Paint stewardship assessment" means the amount paid by each manufacturer that is equal to
the amount of the consumer paint stewardship assessment for architectural paint the manufacturer
sells.
   (h) "Postconsumer paint" means architectural paint not used by the purchaser.
    (i) "Representative organization" means the nonprofit organization created by the manufacturers
to implement the paint stewardship pilot program described in subdivision 3.
   (j) "Retailer" means a person who sells architectural paint at retail.
   Subd. 3. Plan. (a) Starting July 1, 2008, manufacturers of architectural paint sold at retail
9892                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [113TH DAY

must, through a representative organization, implement a pilot stewardship program to undertake
responsibility for the development and implementation of strategies to reduce the generation
of postconsumer paint, promote the reuse of postconsumer paint, and collect, transport, and
process the end-of-life management of postconsumer paint. A cost recovery system must be
established to collect an assessment on all architectural paint sold to recover from consumers
the cost of collecting, storing, transporting and reusing or disposing of postconsumer paint in an
environmentally sound fashion. The cost recovery system shall fund the pilot stewardship program
in the following manner:
    (1) each architectural paint manufacturer shall remit a paint stewardship assessment to the
representative organization implementing the paint stewardship pilot program based on the amount
of architectural paint it sells in this state;
   (2) each Minnesota retailer or distributor of architectural paint shall include a consumer paint
stewardship assessment in the price of all architectural paint it sells; and
    (3) an architectural paint manufacturer shall recover the paint stewardship assessments by
invoicing each of its Minnesota retailers or distributors of architectural paint, who shall remit
payment for the assessments to the architectural paint manufacturer. The funds used by retailers and
distributors to pay the invoices shall be derived from the consumer paint stewardship assessment
attached to the sale of architectural paints by retailers and distributors.
    (b) To ensure that the consumer cost recovery mechanism is equitable and sustainable, a
uniform consumer paint stewardship assessment is established for all architectural paint sold.
The consumer paint stewardship assessment must be reviewed by the commissioner and must be
sufficient to recover, but not exceed, the costs of the paint stewardship pilot program and shall
not exceed $.40 per container. Any assessments collected that exceed the cost of the program, as
reported in the audit required under section 3, must be remitted by the representative organization
to the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency, who shall deposit the assessments in the
environmental fund. Assessments deposited in the environmental fund are appropriated to the
commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency for distribution to counties to conduct household
hazardous waste activities.
   (c) Material shall be provided to the consumer by the manufacturer or representative of the
manufacturer in a manner designed to ensure that consumers are made aware that a consumer paint

must be completed on the stepparent and any children as required under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b), except that a child of the stepparent does not need to have a background study complete if they
are a sibling through birth or adoption of the person being adopted. The local social services agency
of the county in which the prospective adoptive parent lives must initiate a background study unless
a child-placing agency has been involved with the adoption. The local social service agency may
charge a reasonable fee for the background study. If a placement is being made the background
study must be completed prior to placement pursuant to section 259.29, subdivision 1, paragraph
(c). Background study results must be filed with the adoption petition according to section 259.22,
except in an adult adoption where an adoption study and background study are not needed.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.52, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Requirement to search registry before adoption petition can be granted; proof
of search. No petition for adoption may be granted unless the agency supervising the adoptive
placement, the birth mother of the child, or, in the case of a stepparent or relative adoption, the
county agency responsible for the report required under section 259.53, subdivision 1, requests that
the commissioner of health search the registry to determine whether a putative father is registered
in relation to a child who is or may be the subject of an adoption petition. The search required by
this subdivision must be conducted no sooner than 31 days following the birth of the child. A search
of the registry may be proven by the production of a certified copy of the registration form or by
a certified statement of the commissioner of health that after a search no registration of a putative
father in relation to a child who is or may be the subject of an adoption petition could be located. The
filing of a certified copy of an order from a juvenile protection matter under chapter 260C containing
a finding that certification of the requisite search of the Minnesota Fathers' Adoption Registry was
filed with the court in that matter shall also constitute proof of search. Certification that the fathers'
adoption registry has been searched must be filed with the court prior to entry of any final order of
adoption. In addition to the search required by this subdivision, the agency supervising the adoptive
placement, the birth mother of the child, or, in the case of a stepparent or relative adoption, the
­
co­u
   ­n­­y
      t­ social services agency responsible for the report under section 259.53, subdivision 1, or the
responsible social services agency that is a petitioner in a juvenile protection matter under chapter
260C may request that the commissioner of health search the registry at any time.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.53, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Reports and records. (a) The contents of all reports and records of the commissioner
of human services, local social services agency, or child-placing agency bearing on the suitability
of the proposed adoptive home and the child to each other shall not be disclosed either directly
or indirectly to any person other than the commissioner of human services, the child's guardian
ad litem appointed under: (1) section 260C.163 when the guardian's appointment continues under
section 260C.317, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); or (2) section 259.65, or a judge of the court having
jurisdiction of the matter, except as provided in paragraph (b).
    (b) A judge of the court having jurisdiction of the matter shall upon request disclose to a party
to the proceedings or the party's counsel any portion of a report or record that relates only to the
suitability of the proposed adoptive parents. In this disclosure, the judge may withhold the identity

to disclose the identity of individuals providing information, the agency with custody of the report

    Subd. 2. Adoption assistance agreement. The placing agency shall certify a child as eligible
for adoption assistance according to rules promulgated by the commissioner. The placing agency
shall not certify a child who remains under the jurisdiction of the sending agency pursuant to section
260.851, article 5, for state-funded adoption assistance when Minnesota is the receiving state. Not
later than 30 days after a parent or parents are found and approved for adoptive placement of a
child certified as eligible for adoption assistance, and before the final decree of adoption is issued,
a written agreement must be entered into by the commissioner, the adoptive parent or parents, and
the placing agency. The written agreement must be fully completed by the placing agency and in
the form prescribed by the commissioner and must set forth the responsibilities of all parties, the
anticipated duration of the adoption assistance payments, and the payment terms. The adoption
assistance agreement shall be subject to the commissioner's approval, which must be granted or
denied not later than 15 days after the agreement is entered.
    The amount of adoption assistance is subject to the availability of state and federal funds and
shall be determined through agreement with the adoptive parents. The agreement shall take into
consideration the circumstances of the adopting parent or parents, the needs of the child being
adopted and may provide ongoing monthly assistance, supplemental maintenance expenses related

of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, its bylaws or rules, the Interstate
Commission may:
   a. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance; or
   b. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the

the United State District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate
Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal office, to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws or rules. The relief sought may
include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the
prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees; or
   d. Avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of official or

based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission which shall promulgate a rule
binding upon all member states.
   C. The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds
adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the

   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.001, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Child in need of protection services. (a) The paramount consideration in all
proceedings concerning a child alleged or found to be in need of protection or services is the
health, safety, and best interests of the child. In proceedings involving an American Indian child,
9920                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [113TH DAY

as defined in section 260.755, subdivision 8, the best interests of the child must be determined
consistent with sections 260.751 to 260.835 and the Indian Child Welfare Act, United States Code,
title 25, sections 1901 to 1923.
    (b) The purpose of the laws relating to juvenile courts is:
    (1) to secure for each child alleged or adjudicated in need of protection or services and under
the jurisdiction of the court, the care and guidance, preferably in the child's own home, as will best
serve the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the child;
    (2) to provide judicial procedures which protect the welfare of the child;
    (3) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, removing the child from the custody of parents only when the child's welfare or safety
cannot be adequately safeguarded without removal;
    (4) to ensure that when removal from the child's own family is necessary and in the child's best
interests, the responsible social services agency has legal responsibility for the child removal either:
    (i) pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement between the child's parent or guardian and the
responsible social services agency; or
    (ii) by court order pursuant to section 260C.151, subdivision 6; 206C.178; or 260C.201;
    (5) to ensure that, when placement is pursuant to court order, the court order removing the child
or continuing the child in foster care contains an individualized determination that placement is in
the best interests of the child that coincides with the actual removal of the child; and,
                                                                                        ­

    (5) is medically neglected, which includes, but is not limited to, the withholding of medically
indicated treatment from a disabled infant with a life-threatening condition. The term "withholding
of medically indicated treatment" means the failure to respond to the infant's life-threatening
conditions by providing treatment, including appropriate nutrition, hydration, and medication
which, in the treating physician's or physicians' reasonable medical judgment, will be most likely
to be effective in ameliorating or correcting all conditions, except that the term does not include the
failure to provide treatment other than appropriate nutrition, hydration, or medication to an infant
when, in the treating physician's or physicians' reasonable medical judgment:
     (i) the infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;
    (ii) the provision of the treatment would merely prolong dying, not be effective in ameliorating
or correcting all of the infant's life-threatening conditions, or otherwise be futile in terms of the
survival of the infant; or
   (iii) the provision of the treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of the infant
and the treatment itself under the circumstances would be inhumane;

basis for the petition under section 260C.007, subdivision 6, 260C.201, subdivision 11, or 260C.301.
    (1) In the case of a petition alleging the child to be in need of protection or services filed under
this paragraph, if all parties agree and the court finds it is in the best interests of the child, the court
may find the petition states a prima facie case that:
    (i) the child's needs are being met;
    (ii) the placement of the child in foster care is in the best interests of the child;
    (iii) reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the parent or guardian are being made; and
    (iv) the child will be returned home in the next three months.
    (2) If the court makes findings under paragraph (1), the court shall approve the voluntary
arrangement and continue the matter for up to three more months to ensure the child returns to the
parents' home. The responsible social services agency shall:
    (i) report to the court when the child returns home and the progress made by the parent on the
out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, in which case the court shall dismiss
jurisdiction;
    (ii) report to the court that the child has not returned home, in which case the matter shall be
returned to the court for further proceedings under section 260C.163; or
    (iii) if any party does not agree to continue the matter under this paragraph and paragraph (1),
the matter shall proceed under section 260C.163.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 260C.163, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260C.425, hearings on
any matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner. In all adjudicatory
proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services, the court shall admit
only evidence that would be admissible in a civil trial. To be proved at trial, allegations of a petition
alleging a child to be in need of protection or services must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.
     (b) Except for proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and
petitions for the termination of parental rights, hearings may be continued or adjourned from time
to time. In proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and petitions
for the termination of parental rights, hearings may not be continued or adjourned for more than
one week unless the court makes specific findings that the continuance or adjournment is in the best
interests of the child. If a hearing is held on a petition involving physical or sexual abuse of a child

who is alleged to be in need of protection or services or neglected and in foster care, the court shall
file the decision with the court administrator as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after the
matter is submitted to the court. When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding,
the court may make any interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance
with the provisions of sections 260C.001 to 260C.421.

   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.178, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Hearing and release requirements. (a) If a child was taken into custody under
section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (a) or (b)(2), the court shall hold a hearing within 72 hours of
the time the child was taken into custody, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, to determine
whether the child should continue in custody.
    (b) Unless there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others, not return for
a court hearing, run away from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or otherwise not remain
in the care or control of the person to whose lawful custody the child is released, or that the child's
health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the child shall be released to the custody of
a parent, guardian, custodian, or other suitable person, subject to reasonable conditions of release
including, but not limited to, a requirement that the child undergo a chemical use assessment as
provided in section 260C.157, subdivision 1.
    (c) If the court determines there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others;
not return for a court hearing; run away from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian or otherwise
not remain in the care or control of the person to whose lawful custody the child is released; or
that the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered if returned to the care of the
parent or guardian who has custody and from whom the child was removed, the court shall order
the child into foster care under the legal responsibility of the responsible social services agency or
responsible probation or corrections agency for the purposes of protective care as that term is used in
the juvenile court rules.­ or into the home of a noncustodial parent and order the noncustodial parent
to comply with any conditions the court determines to be appropriate to the safety and care of the
child, including cooperating with paternity establishment proceedings in the case of a man who has
not been adjudicated the child's father. The court shall not give the responsible social services legal
custody and order a trial home visit at any time prior to adjudication and disposition under section
260C.201, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (3), but may order the child returned to the care of
the parent or guardian who has custody and from whom the child was removed and order the parent
or guardian to comply with any conditions the court determines to be appropriate to meet the safety,
health, and welfare of the child.
   (d) In determining whether the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the
court shall consider whether the child would reside with a perpetrator of domestic child abuse.
    ­
    (­
     c­
      ) (e) The court, before determining whether a child should be placed in or continue in foster
care under the protective care of the responsible agency, shall also make a determination, consistent
with section 260.012 as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent placement or whether
reasonable efforts to prevent placement are not required. In the case of an Indian child, the court shall
determine whether active efforts, according to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States
Code, title 25, section 1912(d), were made to prevent placement. The court shall enter a finding that
the responsible social services agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement when the
agency establishes either:
   (1) that it has actually provided services or made efforts in an attempt to prevent the child's
removal but that such services or efforts have not proven sufficient to permit the child to safely
remain in the home; or
   (2) that there are no services or other efforts that could be made at the time of the hearing that
could safely permit the child to remain home or to return home. When reasonable efforts to prevent

placement are required and there are services or other efforts that could be ordered which would
permit the child to safely return home, the court shall order the child returned to the care of the
parent or guardian and the services or efforts put in place to ensure the child's safety. When the court
makes a prima facie determination that one of the circumstances under paragraph ­      (­
                                                                                        e­) (g) exists, the
court shall determine that reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to return the child to the care
of the parent or guardian are not required.
    If the court finds the social services agency's preventive or reunification efforts have not been
reasonable but further preventive or reunification efforts could not permit the child to safely remain
at home, the court may nevertheless authorize or continue the removal of the child.
  ­
  (­
   d­) (f) The court may not order or continue the foster care placement of the child unless the court
makes explicit, individualized findings that continued custody of the child by the parent or guardian
would be contrary to the welfare of the child and that placement is in the best interest of the child.
   ­
   (­
    e­
     ) (g) At the emergency removal hearing, or at any time during the course of the proceeding,
and upon notice and request of the county attorney, the court shall determine whether a petition has
been filed stating a prima facie case that:
       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been involuntarily terminated;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
    (4) the parents' custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (e), clause (1), or a similar law of another
jurisdiction; or
    (5) the provision of services or further services for the purpose of reunification is futile and
therefore unreasonable.
   ­
   (­
    f­
     ) (h) When a petition to terminate parental rights is required under section 260C.301,
subdivision 3 or 4, but the county attorney has determined not to proceed with a termination of
parental rights petition, and has instead filed a petition to transfer permanent legal and physical
custody to a relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, the court shall schedule a permanency
hearing within 30 days of the filing of the petition.
    ­
    (g
     ­­) (i) If the county attorney has filed a petition under section 260C.307, the court shall schedule
a trial under section 260C.163 within 90 days of the filing of the petition except when the county
attorney determines that the criminal case shall proceed to trial first under section 260C.201,
subdivision 3.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (j) If the court determines the child should be ordered into foster care and the child's parent
refuses to give information to the responsible social services agency regarding the child's father
or relatives of the child, the court may order the parent to disclose the names, addresses, telephone
numbers, and other identifying information to the responsible social services agency for the purpose
of complying with the requirements of sections 260C.151, 260C.212, and 260C.215.

    ­ i­ (k) If a child ordered into foster care has siblings, whether full, half, or step, who are also
     (­)
ordered into foster care, the court shall inquire of the responsible social services agency of the
efforts to place the children together as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 2, paragraph (d),
if placement together is in each child's best interests, unless a child is in placement due solely to the
child's own behavior or a child is placed with a previously noncustodial parent who is not parent to
all siblings. If the children are not placed together at the time of the hearing, the court shall inquire
at each subsequent hearing of the agency's efforts to place the siblings together. If any sibling is
not placed with another sibling or siblings, the agency must develop a plan for visitation among the
siblings as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1.

safety, or welfare;
    (2) an individual whose suitability for relative placement under section 260C.212, subdivision
5, is being determined and any member of the relative's household who is over the age of 13 when:
    (i) the relative must be licensed for foster care; or
    (ii) the background study is required under section 259.53, subdivision 2; or
    (iii) the agency or the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe the relative or household
member over the age of 13 has a criminal history which would not make transfer of permanent
legal and physical custody to the relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, in the child's best
interest; and
    (3) a parent, following an out-of-home placement, when the responsible social services agency
has reasonable cause to believe that the parent has been convicted of a crime directly related to
the parent's capacity to maintain the child's health, safety, or welfare or the parent is the subject
of an open investigation of, or has been the subject of a substantiated allegation of, child or
vulnerable-adult maltreatment within the past ten years.
"Reasonable cause" means that the agency has received information or a report from the subject or
a third person that creates an articulable suspicion that the individual has a history that may pose
a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the child. The information or report must be specific to
the potential subject of the background check and shall not be based on the race, religion, ethnic
background, age, class, or lifestyle of the potential subject.

subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Assessment for emergency relative placement. The responsible social services
agency may obtain household members' criminal history and the history of maltreatment of a
child or adult and use the history to assess whether putting the child in the household would
endanger the child's health, safety, or welfare and to assess the suitability of a relative prior to
an emergency placement. This assessment does not substitute for the background study required
under chapter 245C and does not supersede requirements related to emergency placement under
section 245A.035.

foster care for treatment under chapter 260D, diagnostic and assessment information, specific
services relating to meeting the mental health care needs of the child, and treatment outcomes.
    (d) The parent or parents or guardian and the child each shall have the right to legal counsel in
the preparation of the case plan and shall be informed of the right at the time of placement of the
child. The child shall also have the right to a guardian ad litem. If unable to employ counsel from
their own resources, the court shall appoint counsel upon the request of the parent or parents or
the child or the child's legal guardian. The parent or parents may also receive assistance from any
person or social services agency in preparation of the case plan.
    After the plan has been agreed upon by the parties involved or approved or ordered by the court,
the foster parents shall be fully informed of the provisions of the case plan and shall be provided a
copy of the plan.
    Upon discharge from foster care, the parent, adoptive parent, or permanent legal and physical
custodian, as appropriate, and the child, if appropriate, must be provided with a current copy of the
child's health and education record.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 260C.212, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Responsible social service agency's duties for children in placement. (a) When a
            ­­a
child is in p l­­em

                      t foster care, the responsible social services agency shall make diligent efforts
to identify, locate, and, where appropriate, offer services to both parents of the child.
    (1) The responsible social services agency shall assess whether a noncustodial or nonadjudicated
parent is willing and capable of providing for the day-to-day care of the child temporarily or
permanently. An assessment under this clause may include, but is not limited to, obtaining
information under section 260C.209. If after assessment, the responsible social services agency
determines that a noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent is willing and capable of providing
day-to-day care of the child, the responsible social services agency may seek authority from the

custodial parent or the court to have that parent assume day-to-day care of the child. If a parent is
not an adjudicated parent, the responsible social services agency shall require the nonadjudicated
parent to cooperate with paternity establishment procedures as part of the case plan.
    (2) If, after assessment, the responsible social services agency determines that the child cannot
be in the day-to-day care of either parent, the agency shall:
   (i) prepare an out-of-home placement plan addressing the conditions that each parent must meet
before the child can be in that parent's day-to-day care; and
    (ii) provide a parent who is the subject of a background study under section 260C.209 15 days'
notice that it intends to use the study to recommend against putting the child with that parent, as
well as the notice provided in section 260C.209, subdivision 4, and the court shall afford the parent
an opportunity to be heard concerning the study.
    The results of a background study of a noncustodial parent shall not be used by the agency to
determine that the parent is incapable of providing day-to-day care of the child unless the agency
reasonably believes that placement of the child into the home of that parent would endanger the
child's health, safety, or welfare.
    (3) If, after the provision of services following an out-of-home placement plan under this section,
the child cannot return to the care of the parent from whom the child was removed or who had
legal custody at the time the child was placed in foster care, the agency may petition on behalf of a
noncustodial parent to establish legal custody with that parent under section 260C.201, subdivision
11. If paternity has not already been established, it may be established in the same proceeding in the
manner provided for under chapter 257.
    (4) The responsible social services agency may be relieved of the requirement to locate and
offer services to both parents by the juvenile court upon a finding of good cause after the filing of
a petition under section 260C.141.

following information:
    (1) the parent and the child each has a right to separate legal counsel before signing a voluntary
placement agreement, but not to counsel appointed at public expense;
    (2) the parent is not required to agree to the voluntary placement, and a parent who enters a
voluntary placement agreement may at any time request that the agency return the child. If the parent
so requests, the child must be returned within 24 hours of the receipt of the request;
    (3) evidence gathered during the time the child is voluntarily placed may be used at a later time
as the basis for a petition alleging that the child is in need of protection or services or as the basis
for a petition seeking termination of parental rights or other permanent placement of the child away
from the parent;
    (4) if the responsible social services agency files a petition alleging that the child is in need of
protection or services or a petition seeking the termination of parental rights or other permanent
placement of the child away from the parent, the parent would have the right to appointment of
separate legal counsel and the child would have a right to the appointment of counsel and a guardian
ad litem as provided by law, and that counsel will be appointed at public expense if they are unable
to afford counsel; and
    (5) the timelines and procedures for review of voluntary placements under subdivision 3, and
the effect the time spent in voluntary placement on the scheduling of a permanent placement
determination hearing under section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
    (d) When an agency accepts a child for placement, the agency shall determine whether the child
has had a physical examination by or under the direction of a licensed physician within the 12 months
immediately preceding the date when the child came into the agency's care. If there is documentation
that the child has had an examination within the last 12 months, the agency is responsible for seeing
that the child has another physical examination within one year of the documented examination
and annually in subsequent years. If the agency determines that the child has not had a physical
examination within the 12 months immediately preceding placement, the agency shall ensure that
the child has an examination within 30 days of coming into the agency's care and once a year in
subsequent years.
    (e) Whether under state guardianship or not, if a child leaves foster care by reason of having
attained the age of majority under state law, the child must be given at no cost a copy of the child's

   (6) the appropriateness of the services provided to the child.
    (d) When a child is age 16 or older, in addition to any administrative review conducted by the
agency, at the review required under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (d), clause (3),
item (iii); or 260C.317, subdivision 3, clause (3), the court shall review the independent living plan
required under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), clause (8), and the provision of services to the child
related to the well-being of the child as the child prepares to leave foster care. The review shall
include the actual plans related to each item in the plan necessary to the child's future safety and
well-being when the child is no longer in foster care.
    (1) At the court review, the responsible social services agency shall establish that it has given
the notice required under Minnesota Rules, part 9560.0060, regarding the right to continued access
to services for certain children in foster care past age 18 and of the right to appeal a denial of social
services under section 256.245. If the agency is unable to establish that the notice, including the
right to appeal a denial of social services, has been given, the court shall require the agency to give
it.
   (2) The court shall make findings regarding progress toward or accomplishment of the following
goals:
   (i) the child has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent;
   (ii) the child has completed a driver's education course or has demonstrated the ability to use
public transportation in the child's community;
   (iii) the child is employed or enrolled in postsecondary education;
    (iv) the child has applied for and obtained postsecondary education financial aid for which the
child is eligible;
  (v) the child has health care coverage and health care providers to meet the child's physical and
mental health needs;
    (vi) the child has applied for and obtained disability income assistance for which the child is
eligible;
   (vii) the child has obtained affordable housing with necessary supports, which does not include
a homeless shelter;
   (viii) the child has saved sufficient funds to pay for the first month's rent and a damage deposit;

   (ix) the child has an alternative affordable housing plan, which does not include a homeless
shelter, if the original housing plan is unworkable;
     (x) the child, if male, has registered for the Selective Service; and
     (xi) the child has a permanent connection to a caring adult.
    (3) The court shall ensure that the responsible agency in conjunction with the placement provider
assists the child in obtaining the following documents prior to the child's leaving foster care: a Social
Security card; the child's birth certificate; a state identification card or driver's license, green card,
or school visa; the child's school, medical, and dental records; a contact list of the child's medical,
dental, and mental health providers; and contact information for the child's siblings, if the siblings
are in foster care.

agency must proceed on the petition filed alleging the child in need of protection or services or
the petition for termination of parental rights or other permanent placement of the child away from
the parent. The court must find a statutory basis to order the placement of the child under section
260C.178; 260C.201; or 260C.317.

responsibilities to the child.
    (b) The court shall order transfer of guardianship and legal custody of a child to the commissioner
of human services only when the responsible county social services agency had legal responsibility
for planning for the permanent placement of the child and the child was in foster care under the
legal responsibility of the responsible county social services agency at the time the court orders
guardianship and legal custody transferred to the commissioner.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.325, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Both parents deceased. (a) If upon petition to the juvenile court by a reputable person,
including but not limited to an agent of the commissioner of human services, and upon hearing
in the manner provided in section 260C.163, the court finds that both parents or the only known
legal parent are or is deceased and no appointment has been made or petition for appointment filed
pursuant to sections 524.5-201 to 524.5-317, the court shall order the guardianship and legal custody
of the child transferred to:
   ­
   (­

   ­
   (b

   Sec. 44. [260D.001] CHILD IN VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    (a) Sections 260D.001 to 260D.301, may be cited as the "child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" provisions of the Juvenile Court Act.
    (b) The juvenile court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment upon the filing of a report or petition required under this chapter. All obligations of
the agency to a child and family in foster care contained in chapter 260C not inconsistent with this
chapter are also obligations of the agency with regard to a child in foster care for treatment under
this chapter.
    (c) This chapter shall be construed consistently with the mission of the children's mental health
service system as set out in section 245.487, subdivision 3, and the duties of an agency under section
256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016, to meet the needs of a child with a
developmental disability or related condition. This chapter:
113TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                         9939

    (1) establishes voluntary foster care through a voluntary foster care agreement as the means for
an agency and a parent to provide needed treatment when the child must be in foster care to receive
necessary treatment for an emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition;
    (2) establishes court review requirements for a child in voluntary foster care for treatment due
to emotional disturbance or developmental disability or a related condition;
    (3) establishes the ongoing responsibility of the parent as legal custodian to visit the child, to
plan together with the agency for the child's treatment needs, to be available and accessible to the
agency to make treatment decisions, and to obtain necessary medical, dental, and other care for the
child; and
    (4) applies to voluntary foster care when the child's parent and the agency agree that the child's
treatment needs require foster care either:
   (i) due to a level of care determination by the agency's screening team informed by the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
    (ii) due to a determination regarding the level of services needed by the responsible social
services' screening team under section 256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to
9525.0016.
    (d) This chapter does not apply when there is a current determination under section 626.556 that
the child requires child protective services or when the child is in foster care for any reason other
than treatment for the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition.
When there is a determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services
based on an assessment that there are safety and risk issues for the child that have not been mitigated
through the parent's engagement in services or otherwise, or when the child is in foster care for any
reason other than the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition,
the provisions of chapter 260C apply.
    (e) The paramount consideration in all proceedings concerning a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment is the safety, health, and the best interests of the child. The purpose of this chapter is:
   (1) to ensure a child with a disability is provided the services necessary to treat or ameliorate the
symptoms of the child's disability;
    (2) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, approving the child's placement away from the child's parents only when the child's need
for care or treatment requires it and the child cannot be maintained in the home of the parent; and
    (3) to ensure the child's parent retains legal custody of the child and associated decision-making
authority unless the child's parent willfully fails or is unable to make decisions that meet the child's
safety, health, and best interests. The court may not find that the parent willfully fails or is unable
to make decisions that meet the child's needs solely because the parent disagrees with the agency's
choice of foster care facility, unless the agency files a petition under chapter 260C, and establishes
by clear and convincing evidence that the child is in need of protection or services.
    (f) The legal parent-child relationship shall be supported under this chapter by maintaining the
parent's legal authority and responsibility for ongoing planning for the child and by the agency's
assisting the parent, where necessary, to exercise the parent's ongoing right and obligation to visit
9940                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [113TH DAY

or to have reasonable contact with the child. Ongoing planning means:
   (1) actively participating in the planning and provision of educational services, medical, and
dental care for the child;
    (2) actively planning and participating with the agency and the foster care facility for the child's
treatment needs; and
    (3) planning to meet the child's need for safety, stability, and permanency, and the child's need
to stay connected to the child's family and community.
     (g) The provisions of section 260.012 to ensure placement prevention, family reunification, and
all active and reasonable effort requirements of that section apply. This chapter shall be construed
consistently with the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code,
title 25, section 1901, et.al., and the provisions of the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act,
sections 260.751 to 260.835.

   Subd. 4. Child. "Child" means an individual under 18 years of age.
    Subd. 5. Child in voluntary foster care for treatment. "Child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" means a child who is emotionally disturbed or developmentally disabled or has a related
condition and is in foster care under a voluntary foster care agreement between the child's parent
and the agency due to concurrence between the agency and the parent that the child's level of care
requires placement in foster care either:
   (1) due to a determination by the agency's screening team based on its review of the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
   (2) due to a determination by the agency's screening team under section 256B.092 and Minnesota
Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016.
    A child is not in voluntary foster care for treatment under this chapter when there is a current
determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services or when the
child is in foster care for any reason other than the child's emotional or developmental disability or
related condition.
   Subd. 6. Compelling reasons. "Compelling reasons" has the same meaning given in section
113TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                         9941

260C.007, subdivision 8. The agency may determine compelling reasons when the child is in foster
care for treatment and no grounds to terminate parental rights exist because the child must be in
placement to access treatment, the child's individual treatment needs cannot be met in the childs'

not licensed. Foster care does not include placement in any of the following facilities: hospitals,
inpatient chemical dependency treatment facilities, facilities that are primarily for delinquent
children, any corrections facility or program within a particular corrections facility not meeting

is committed under the provision of chapter 253B, forestry camps, or jails.
    Subd. 11. Legal authority to place the child. "Legal authority to place the child" means the
agency has legal responsibility for the care and control of the child while the child is in foster care.
The agency may acquire legal authority to place a child through a voluntary placement agreement
between the agency and the child's parent under this chapter. Legal authority to place the child does
not mean the agency has authority to make major life decisions regarding the child, including major
medical decisions. A parent with legal custody of the child continues to have legal authority to make
major life decisions regarding the child, including major medical decisions.
   Subd. 12. Minor. "Minor" means an individual under 18 years of age.
    Subd. 13. Parent. "Parent" means the birth or adoptive parent of a minor. Parent also means the

or custom, as provided in section 260.755, subdivision 14.
     Subd. 14. Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanent plan for the child. "Reasonable efforts
to finalize a permanent plan for the child" has the same meaning under this chapter as provided in

   Sec. 46. [260D.101] VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE.
    Subdivision 1. Voluntary foster care. When the agency's screening team, based upon
the diagnostic and functional assessment under section 245.4885 or 256B.092, subdivision 7,
9942                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [113TH DAY

determines the child's need for treatment due to emotional disturbance or developmental disability
or related condition requires foster care placement of the child, a voluntary foster care agreement
between the child's parent and the agency gives the agency legal authority to place the child in
foster care.
    Subd. 2. Voluntary foster care agreement. A voluntary foster care agreement shall be used
to provide the agency the legal authority to place a child in foster care for treatment due to the
child's disability. The agreement must be in writing and signed by both the child's parent and the

    (j) If the court finds continuing the voluntary foster care arrangement is not in the child's best

notify the agency, the parent, the foster parent or foster care facility, the child, age 12 or older, and
the county attorney of the court's determinations and the basis for the court's determinations. In this
case, the court shall set the matter for hearing and appoint a guardian ad litem for the child under

   Sec. 50. [260D.107] REQUIRED PERMANENCY REVIEW HEARING.
    (a) When the court has found that the voluntary arrangement is in the child's best interests and that
the agency and parent are appropriately planning for the child pursuant to the report submitted under

hearing by United States mail on the parent, the child age 12 or older, the child's guardian ad litem,
if one has been appointed, the agency, the county attorney, and counsel for any party.
    (f) The court shall conduct the permanency review hearing on the petition no later than 14 months

terminate jurisdiction and to dismiss an order for foster care under chapter 260C, as provided in
section 260D.201, paragraph (b).
   (g) At the permanency review hearing, the court shall:
   (1) inquire of the parent if the parent has reviewed the "Petition for Permanency Review
Regarding a Child in Voluntary Foster Care for Treatment," whether the petition is accurate, and
9946                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [113TH DAY

whether the parent agrees to the continued voluntary foster care arrangement as being in the child's
best interests;
    (2) inquire of the parent if the parent is satisfied with the agency's reasonable efforts to finalize
the permanent plan for the child, including whether there are services available and accessible to
the parent that might allow the child to safely be with the child's family;
   (3) inquire of the parent if the parent consents to the court entering an order that:
    (i) approves the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the
child, which includes ongoing future planning for the safety, health, and best interests of the child;
and
   (ii) approves the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling reasons why the
continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests; and
   (4) inquire of the child's guardian ad litem and any other party whether the guardian or the party
agrees that:
    (i) the court should approve the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent
plan for the child, which includes ongoing and future planning for the safety, health, and best
interests of the child; and
    (ii) the court should approve of the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling
reasons why the continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests.
   (h) At a permanency review hearing under this section, the court may take the following actions
based on the contents of the sworn petition and the consent of the parent:
   (1) approve the agency's compelling reasons that the voluntary foster care arrangement is in the
best interests of the child; and
    (2) find that the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize a plan for the permanent plan for
the child.
    (i) A child, age 12 or older, may object to the agency's request that the court approve its
compelling reasons for the continued voluntary arrangement and may be heard on the reasons
for the objection. Notwithstanding the child's objection, the court may approve the agency's
compelling reasons and the voluntary arrangement.
    (j) If the court does not approve the voluntary arrangement after hearing from the child or the
child's guardian ad litem, the court shall dismiss the petition. In this case, either:
   (1) the child must be returned to the care of the parent; or
    (2) the agency must file a petition under section 260C.141, asking for appropriate relief under
section 260C.201, subdivision 11, or 260C.301.
    (k) When the court approves the agency's compelling reasons for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, and finds that the agency has made reasonable efforts to
finalize a permanent plan for the child, the court shall approve the continued voluntary foster care
arrangement, and continue the matter under the court's jurisdiction for the purposes of reviewing

the child's placement every 12 months while the child is in foster care.
   (l) A finding that the court approves the continued voluntary placement means the agency has
continued legal authority to place the child while a voluntary placement agreement remains in effect.
The parent or the agency may terminate a voluntary agreement as provided in section 260D.301.
Termination of a voluntary foster care placement of an Indian child is governed by section 260.765,

   Sec. 51. [260D.109] ANNUAL REVIEW.
   (a) After the court conducts a permanency review hearing under section 260D.107, the matter
must be returned to the court for further review of the child's foster care placement at least every
12 months while the child is in foster care. The court shall give notice to the parent and child, age
12 or older, and the foster parents of the continued review requirements under this section at the
permanency review hearing.
    (b) Every 12 months, the court shall determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to
finalize the permanency plan for the child, which means the exercise of due diligence by the agency
to:
    (1) ensure that the agreement for voluntary foster care is the most appropriate legal arrangement
to meet the child's safety, health, and best interests;
    (2) engage and support the parent in continued involvement in planning and decision making
for the needs of the child;
   (3) strengthen the child's ties to the parent, relatives, and community;
   (4) implement the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1,
and ensure that the plan requires the provision of appropriate services to address the physical health,
mental health, and educational needs of the child; and
    (5) ensure appropriate planning for the child's safe, permanent, and independent living
arrangement after the child's 18th birthday.
  Sec. 52. [260D.201] PERMANENCY REVIEW AFTER ADJUDICATION UNDER
CHAPTER 260C.
    (a) If a child has been ordered into foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision
1, and the conditions that led to the court's order have been corrected so that the child could safely
return home except for the child's need to continue in foster care for treatment due to the child's
disability, the child's parent and the agency may enter into a voluntary foster care agreement under
this chapter using the procedure set out in paragraph (b).
   (b) When the agency and the parent agree to enter into a voluntary foster care agreement
under this chapter, the agency must file a motion to terminate jurisdiction under section 260C.193,
subdivision 6, and to dismiss the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1, together with the petition required under section 260D.107, paragraph (b), for
permanency review and the court's approval of the voluntary arrangement.
    (c) The court shall send the motion and the petition filed under subdivision 2 together with a
notice of hearing by mail as required in section 260D.107, paragraph (e).
9948                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [113TH DAY

    (d) The petition and motion under this section must be filed no later than the time the agency is
required to file a petition for permanent placement under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, but may
be filed as soon as the agency and the parent agree that the child should remain in foster care under
a voluntary foster care agreement, because the child needs treatment and voluntary foster care is in
the child's best interest.
    (e) In order for the agency to have continuous legal authority to place the child, the parent and the
agency must execute a voluntary foster care agreement for the child's continuation in foster care for
treatment prior to the termination of the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1. The parent and agency may execute the voluntary foster care agreement at or before
the permanency review hearing required under this section. The voluntary foster care agreement
shall not be effective until the court terminates jurisdiction under section 260C.193, subdivision 6,
and dismisses the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision 1. Unless
the agency and the parent execute a voluntary placement agreement for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, the agency shall not have legal authority to place the child after
the court terminates jurisdiction under chapter 260C.
   Sec. 53. [260D.301] TERMINATION OF VOLUNTARY PLACEMENT AGREEMENT.
    (a) The child's parent may terminate a voluntary placement agreement under this chapter upon
written notice to the agency of the termination of the agreement. The termination of a voluntary
foster care agreement regarding an Indian child shall be governed by section 260.765, subdivision
4.
    (b) The agency may terminate a voluntary placement agreement under this section upon written
notice of the termination of the agreement to the parent. Prior to sending notice of termination of the
voluntary foster care placement agreement, the agency shall contact the parent regarding transition
planning under paragraph (e). Written notice by the agency shall be considered received by the
parent three business days after mailing by the agency.
    (c) Upon receipt of notice of the termination of the voluntary foster care agreement, the agency,
the parent, and the facility may agree to a time that the child shall return home. The scheduled time
to return home shall meet the child's need for safety and reasonable transition. Unless otherwise
agreed by the parent and the agency, the child's return home shall not occur sooner than 72 hours
and not later than 30 days after written notice of termination is received or sent by the agency.
    (d) A parent who disagrees with the termination of a voluntary foster care agreement by the
agency under this chapter has the right to a fair hearing under section 256.045 to appeal the
termination of the voluntary foster care agreement. When the agency gives written notice to the
parent of the termination of the agreement, the agency must also give the parent notice of the
parent's right to a fair hearing under section 256.045 to appeal the agency's decision to terminate
the voluntary foster care agreement.
    (e) The agency and the child's parents shall engage in transition planning for the child's return
home, including establishing a scheduled time for the child to return home, an increased visitation
plan between the parent and child, and a plan for what services will be provided and in place upon
the child's return home.
   (f) Notice of termination of voluntary foster care agreement does not terminate the agreement.
The voluntary foster care agreement and the agency's legal authority to place the child are terminated

disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision under section
245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual

judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for purposes of appeal.

under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.
     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.29, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Conclusive disqualification determination. (a) Unless otherwise specified in statute,
a determination that:
   (1) the information the commissioner relied upon to disqualify an individual under section
245C.14 was correct based on serious or recurring maltreatment;

an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; or
   (3) the individual failed to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or
626.557, subdivision 3, is conclusive if:
   (i) the commissioner has issued a final order in an appeal of that determination under section
245A.08, subdivision 5, or 256.045, or a court has issued a final decision;
     (ii) the individual did not request reconsideration of the disqualification under section 245C.21;
or
   (iii) the individual did not request a hearing on the disqualification under section 256.045 or
chapter 14.
    (b) When a licensing action under section 245A.05, 245A.06, or 245A.07 is based on the
disqualification of an individual in connection with a license to provide family child care, foster
care for children in the provider's own home, or foster care services for adults in the provider's own
home, that disqualification shall be conclusive for purposes of the licensing action if a request for
reconsideration was not submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice
of disqualification.
   (c) If a determination that the information relied upon to disqualify an individual was correct
and is conclusive under this section, and the individual is subsequently disqualified under section
245C.15, the individual has a right to request reconsideration on the risk of harm under section
245C.21. Subsequent determinations regarding the risk of harm shall be made according to section
245C.22 and are not subject to another hearing under section 256.045 or chapter 14.

aggrieved by a ruling of a prepaid health plan; (4) except as provided under chapter 245C, any

convincing evidence that the individual has committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any
of the crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4; or for failing to make reports required
under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or 626.557, subdivision 3. Hearings regarding a maltreatment
determination under clause (4) or (9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for
a disqualification is serious or recurring maltreatment, which has not been set aside under sections
245C.22 and 245C.23, shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of
review by the human services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the
disqualification. The failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be
a bar to a hearing under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to
dispute a finding of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest
the specified action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written
request for a hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action,
decision, or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient,
patient, or relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time
limit.
    The hearing for an individual or facility under clause (4), (9), or (10) is the only administrative
appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to the accuracy and
completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under clause (4) apply only to
incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995. Hearings requested by nursing
assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident prior to October 1, 1995, shall be
held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter 14. Hearings requested under
clause (9) apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing
for an individual or facility under clause (9) is only available when there is no juvenile court or
adult criminal action pending. If such action is filed in either court while an administrative review
is pending, the administrative review must be suspended until the judicial actions are completed.
If the juvenile court action or criminal charge is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the
matter may be considered in an administrative hearing.
   For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
   The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under clause (5) shall be limited

to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement under court order
or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care payment to be made
on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's child protection
determination or child placement decision.
   (b) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing
under this section, except if assisting a recipient as provided in subdivision 4.
   (c) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.
   (d) The commissioner may summarily affirm the county or state agency's proposed action
without a hearing when the sole issue is an automatic change due to a change in state or federal law.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.045, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3b. Standard of evidence for maltreatment and disqualification hearings. (a) The
state human services referee shall determine that maltreatment has occurred if a preponderance of
evidence exists to support the final disposition under sections 626.556 and 626.557. For purposes
of hearings regarding disqualification, the state human services referee shall affirm the proposed
disqualification in an appeal under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clause (9), if ­

section 626.556 or 626.557, which is serious or recurring;
    (2) clear and convincing evidence shows the individual has committed an act or acts meeting
the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4; or
    (3) a preponderance of the evidence shows the individual has failed to make required reports
under section 626.556 or 626.557, for incidents in which the final disposition under section 626.556
or 626.557 was substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring.
    (b) If the disqualification is affirmed, the state human services referee shall determine whether the
individual poses a risk of harm in accordance with the requirements of section 245C.16, and whether
the disqualification should be set aside or not set aside. In determining whether the disqualification
should be set aside, the human services referee shall consider all of the characteristics that cause
the individual to be disqualified, including those characteristics that were not subject to review
under paragraph (a), in order to determine whether the individual poses a risk of harm. A decision
to set aside a disqualification that is the subject of the hearing constitutes a determination that
the individual does not pose a risk of harm and that the individual may provide direct contact
services in the individual program specified in the set aside. If a determination that the information
relied upon to disqualify an individual was correct and is conclusive under section 245C.29, and
the individual is subsequently disqualified under section 245C.14, the individual has a right to
again request reconsideration on the risk of harm under section 245C.21. Subsequent determinations
regarding risk of harm are not subject to another hearing under this section.
    (c) The state human services referee shall recommend an order to the commissioner of health,
education, or human services, as applicable, who shall issue a final order. The commissioner shall
affirm, reverse, or modify the final disposition. Any order of the commissioner issued in accordance

subdivision 7. In any licensing appeal under chapters 245A and 245C and sections 144.50 to 144.58
and 144A.02 to 144A.46, the commissioner's determination as to maltreatment is conclusive, as

forms under which a birth parent may agree to or object to the release of the original birth record to
the adopted person. The department shall make the forms readily accessible to birth parents on the
department's Web site.
    Subd. 2. Disclosure. Upon request, the state registrar shall provide a noncertified copy of the
original birth record to an adopted person age 19 or older, unless there is an affidavit of nondisclosure
on file. The state registrar must comply with the terms of affidavits of disclosure or affidavits of
nondisclosure.

affidavit of nondisclosure at any time.
    Subd. 4. Affidavit of nondisclosure; access to birth record. (a) If an affidavit of nondisclosure

than 45 days after the filing of the vital record is $40. No fee shall be charged for an amendment
requested within 45 days after the filing of the vital record. The fee is payable at the time of
application and is nonrefundable. This fee includes one subsequent review of the request if the
request is not acceptable upon the initial receipt.
    (e) The fee for processing a request for the verification of information from vital records is $9
when the applicant furnishes the specific information to locate the vital record. When the applicant
does not furnish specific information, the fee is $20 per hour for staff time expended. Specific

       Remember: It is important that you learn as much as you can about foreclosure and your
       situation. Find out about all your options before you make any agreements with anyone about
       the foreclosure of your home.
       Getting Help
       As soon as possible, you should contact your lender at the above number to talk about things
       you might be able to do to prevent foreclosure. You should also consider contacting the
       foreclosure prevention counselor in your area. A foreclosure prevention counselor can answer
       your questions, offer free advice, and help you create a plan which makes sense for your
       situation.
       Contact the Minnesota Home Ownership Center at 651-659-9336 or 866-462-6466 or
       www.hocmn.org to get the phone number and location of the nearest counseling organization.
       Call today. The longer you wait, the fewer options you may have for a desirable result.
       Information About the Foreclosure Process
       You do not need to move at the time of the sheriff's sale. After the sheriff's sale you have
       the right to "redeem." Redeem means that you pay off the entire loan amount plus fees to
       keep your house. You can keep living in your home for a period of time. This is called a
       "redemption period." The redemption period is [insert number of months] months after the
       sheriff's sale. This redemption period is your chance to try and sell your home or refinance
       it with a different loan. You can also pay the redemption amount with any other funds you
       have available. At the end of the redemption period you will have to leave your home. If you
       do not, the person or company that bid on your home at the sheriff's sale has the right to file
       an eviction against you in district court."
   Sec. 11. [580.042] FORECLOSURE ADVICE NOTICE TO TENANT.
   Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies to foreclosure of mortgages under this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Form of delivery of notice. The notice required by this section must be in 14-point
boldface type and must be printed on colored paper that is other than the color of the notice of
foreclosure and of the notice to be given under section 580.041, subdivision 1b, and that does not
obscure or overshadow the content of the notice. The title of the notice must be in 20-point boldface
type. The notice must be on its own page.
    Subd. 3. Content of notice. The notice required by this section must appear substantially as
follows.
                                       "Foreclosure: Advice to Tenants
    You are renting in a property that is in foreclosure. Minnesota law requires that we send you this
notice about the foreclosure process. Please read it carefully.
   The mortgage foreclosure does not change the terms of your lease. You and your landlord
must continue to follow the terms of your lease, including the rights and responsibilities of
you and your landlord. You must keep paying rent unless you have a legal reason to withhold
9976                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [113TH DAY

it. Your landlord must keep the property repaired. Utilities must be paid under the terms of
your lease or under state law.
    Moving out of the property early might be a violation of your lease. The date of the sheriff's
foreclosure sale is in the attached foreclosure notice. In most cases you do not need to move from
the property before the sheriff's foreclosure sale. Read your lease to see if it says anything about
foreclosure and about the rights you may have if the property is in foreclosure. If you have a
month-to-month lease, the foreclosure notice does not change the rules for ending your lease. You
and your landlord must still give legal notice to end your lease.
    In most cases, your landlord has six months after the date of the sheriff's foreclosure sale to pay
off the mortgage. This is called the "redemption period." Read the attached foreclosure notice to
determine the length of the redemption period. You cannot be asked to move during the redemption
period except for lease violations or if your lease expires during the redemption period. If your
landlord stops the foreclosure, you may not have to move from the property. If your landlord does
not stop the foreclosure, there will be a new owner of the property at the end of the redemption
period.
    The new owner may have the legal right to ask you to move even if your lease is not over. But,
the new owner must still give you a written notice stating that the new owner wants you to move.
   Do not wait to get information about foreclosure. Mortgage foreclosure is a complicated
process. It is important you learn about your rights as a renter when there is a mortgage foreclosure.
You may have fewer options if you wait too long. There are government agencies and nonprofit
organizations that you may contact for helpful information about the foreclosure process. For the
name and telephone number of an organization near you, please call the legal aid office or bar
association office in your county. You also can find information on tenant rights at HOME Line at
(866) 866-3546 and Law Help Minnesota at http://www.LawHelpMN.org. The state of Minnesota
does not guarantee the advice of these agencies and organizations."
    Subd. 4. Affidavit. Any person may establish compliance with or inapplicability of this
section by recording, with the county recorder or registrar of titles, an affidavit by a person having
knowledge of the facts, stating that the notice required by this section has been delivered in
compliance with this section. The affidavit and a certified copy of a recorded affidavit is prima
facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. The affidavit may be recorded regarding any
foreclosure sale, including foreclosure sales that occurred prior to August 1, 2008, and may be
recorded separately or as part of the record of a foreclosure.
    Subd. 5. Validation of foreclosure sales; remedy for violation. (a) No mortgage foreclosure
sale under this chapter is invalid because of failure to comply with this section.
    (b) The remedy for a violation of this section is limited to actual damages caused by the violation,
not to exceed $1,000, and is available only to the tenant of the mortgaged premises who occupied
the mortgaged premises during the redemption period of the mortgagor. Any legal action brought to
enforce the provisions of this section must be commenced by the last day of the redemption period
of the mortgagor. A person is not liable in an action for a violation of this section if the person
shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from
a bona fide error and the person adopted and maintained reasonable procedures to avoid the error.
A plaintiff does not have cause of action if the defendant has complied with section 580.03.

    580.12 CERTIFICATE OF SALE; RECORD; EFFECT.
    When any sale of real property is made under a power of sale contained in any mortgage, the
officer shall make and deliver to the purchaser a certificate, executed in the same manner as a
conveyance, containing:
    (1) a description of the mortgage;
    (2) a description of the property sold;
    (3) the price paid for each parcel sold;
    (4) the time and place of the sale, and the name of the purchaser;
    (5) the interest rate in effect on the date of the sheriff's sale; and
    ­
    (5
     ­­) (6) the time allowed by law for redemption, provided that if the redemption period stated
in the certificate is five weeks and a longer redemption period was stated in the published notice
of foreclosure sale, a certified copy of the court order entered under section 582.032, authorizing
reduction of the redemption period to five weeks, must be attached to the certificate.
    A certificate which states a five-week redemption period must be recorded within ten days after
the sale; any other certificate must be recorded within 20 days after the sale. When so recorded, upon
expiration of the time for redemption, the certificate shall operate as a conveyance to the purchaser
or the purchaser's assignee of all the right, title, and interest of the mortgagor in and to the premises
named therein at the date of such mortgage, without any other conveyance. A certificate must not
contain a time allowed for redemption that is less than the time specified by section 580.23, 582.032,
or 582.32, whichever applies.

period, of written confirmation from the holder of the sheriff's certificate or the attorney for the

specific sum less than the full amount due for redemption.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 580.24, is amended to read:
   580.24 REDEMPTION BY CREDITOR.
    (a) If no redemption is made by the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal representatives or
assigns, the most senior creditor having a legal or equitable lien upon the mortgaged premises,
or some part of it, subsequent to the foreclosed mortgage, may redeem within seven days after
the expiration of the redemption period determined under section 580.23 or 582.032, whichever is
applicable; and each subsequent creditor having a lien may redeem, in the order of priority of their
respective liens, within seven days after the time allowed the prior lienholder by paying the amount
required under this section. However, no creditor is entitled to redeem unless, w ­­t
                                                                                    i­h

                                                                                       i­ one week or
more prior to the expiration of the period allowed for redemption by the mortgagor, the creditor:
   (1) records with each county recorder and registrar of titles where the foreclosed mortgage is
recorded a notice of the creditor's intention to redeem;

                                  e with each county recorder and registrar of titles where the notice
of the creditor's intention to redeem is recorded all documents necessary to create the lien on the
mortgaged premises and to evidence the creditor's ownership of the lien, including a copy of any
money judgment necessary to create the lien; and
    (3) after complying with clauses (1) and (2), delivers to the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure
sale or the sheriff's successor in office a copy of each of the documents required to be recorded under
clauses (1) and (2), with the office, date and time of filing for record stated on the first page of each
document.
    The sheriff shall maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff and shall
note the date of delivery on each document. The sheriff may charge a fee of $100 for the documents
delivered to the sheriff relating to each lien. The sheriff shall maintain copies of documents delivered
to the sheriff for a period of six months after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
    (b) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and the first day following the expiration of the prior
redemption period must be included in computing the seven-day redemption period. When the
last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, that day must be omitted from
the computation. The order of redemption by judgment creditors subsequent to the foreclosed
mortgage shall be determined by the order in which their judgments were entered as memorials
on the certificate of title for the foreclosed premises or docketed in the office of the district

court administrator if the property is not registered under chapter 508 or 508A, regardless of the
homestead status of the property. All mechanic's lienholders who have coordinate liens shall have
one combined seven-day period to redeem.
    (c) The amount required to redeem from the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale is the amount
required under section 580.23. The amount required to redeem from a person holding a certificate
of redemption is:
     (1) the amount paid to redeem as shown on the certificate of redemption; plus
     (2) interest on that amount to the date of redemption; plus
    (3) the amount claimed due on the person's lien, as shown on the affidavit under section 580.25,
clause (3).
    The amount required to redeem may be paid to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale or
the certificate of redemption, as the case may be, or to the sheriff for the holder.
     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.25, is amended to read:
     580.25 REDEMPTION, HOW MADE.
     Redemption shall be made as provided in this section.
   The person desiring to redeem shall pay the amount required by law for the redemption, and
shall produce to the person or officer receiving the redemption payment:

other than the county seat, it is sufficient forthwith to deposit the documents in the nearest post
office, addressed to the recorder or registrar of titles, with the postage prepaid. A person recording
documents produced for redemption shall, on the same day, deliver copies of the documents to the
sheriff for public inspection. The sheriff may receive a fee of $20 for the documents delivered
following a redemption. The sheriff shall note the date of delivery on the documents and shall
maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff for a period of six months
after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.28, is amended to read:
   580.28 ACTION TO SET ASIDE MORTGAGE; FORECLOSURE; REDEMPTION.
    When an action is brought wherein it is claimed that any mortgage as to the plaintiff or person
for whose benefit the action is brought is fraudulent or void, or has been paid or discharged, in
whole or in part, or the relative priority or the validity of liens is disputed, if such mortgage has
been foreclosed by advertisement, and the time for redemption from the foreclosure sale will expire
before final judgment in such action, the plaintiff or beneficiary having the right to redeem, for the
purpose of saving such right in case the action fails, may deposit with the sheriff before the time of
redemption expires the amount for which the mortgaged premises were sold, with interest thereon to
the time of deposit, together with a bond to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale, in an amount
and with sureties to be approved by the sheriff, conditioned to pay all interest that may accrue or be
allowed on such deposit if the action fail. The person shall, in writing, notify such sheriff that the
person claims the mortgage to be fraudulent or void, or to have been paid or discharged, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, and that such action is pending, and direct the sheriff to retain such money
and bond until final judgment. In case such action fails, such deposit shall operate as a redemption
of the premises from such foreclosure sale, and entitle the plaintiff to a certificate thereof. Such
foreclosure, deposit, bond, and notice shall be brought to the attention of the court by supplemental
complaint in the action, and the judgment shall determine the validity of the foreclosure sale, and
the rights of the parties to the moneys and bond so deposited, which shall be paid and delivered by
the sheriff as directed by such judgment upon delivery to the sheriff of a certified copy thereof. The
remedy herein provided shall be in addition to other remedies now existing.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.30, is amended to read:
   580.30 MORTGAGES, WHEN REINSTATED.
    Subdivision 1. Reinstatement. In any proceedings for the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage,
whether by action or by advertisement, if at any time before the sale of the premises under such
foreclosure the mortgagor, the owner, or any holder of any subsequent encumbrance or lien, or any
one for them, shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the mortgage so being foreclosed, or to
the attorney foreclosing the same, or to the sheriff of the county, the amount actually due thereon
and constituting the default actually existing in the conditions of the mortgage at the time of the
commencement of the foreclosure proceedings, including insurance, delinquent taxes, if any, upon
the premises, interest to date of payment, cost of publication and services of process or notices,
attorney's fees not exceeding $150 or one-half of the attorney's fees authorized by section 582.01,
whichever is greater, together with other lawful disbursements necessarily incurred in connection
with the proceedings by the party foreclosing, then, and in that event, the mortgage shall be fully

reinstated and further proceedings in such foreclosure shall be thereupon abandoned.
    Subd. 2. Request by sheriff. Upon written request by the sheriff, the holder of the mortgage
or the holder's legal representative shall provide to the sheriff within seven days of the date of
the request by the sheriff to the foreclosing attorney: (1) the current payoff amount, showing
outstanding principal, interest, and a daily interest accrual amount, (2) an itemized schedule of the
current amounts necessary to reinstate the mortgage, and (3) the identity of the person or entity
with authority to act on behalf of the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
If the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative fails to respond to the sheriff's
request within seven days of the date of the request, the sheriff shall postpone the sheriff's sale and
the sheriff shall announce at the sheriff's sale the postponement of the sale. The postponement does
not need to be published. If the request by the sheriff is made seven days or less before the sheriff's
sale, the holder of the mortgage or the holder's representative shall make a good faith effort to
respond to the sheriff before the sheriff's sale, but the sheriff may conduct the sheriff's sale without
a response from the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
    Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 581.10, is amended to read:
    581.10 REDEMPTION BY MORTGAGOR, CREDITOR.
     The mortgagor, or those claiming under the mortgagor, within the time specified in section
580.23 or 582.032, whichever applies, after the date of the order of confirmation, may redeem the
premises sold, or any separate portion thereof, by paying the amount bid therefor, with interest
thereon from the time of sale ­       a­

                                ­n
sale was held at any time prior to expiration of the mortgagor's redemption period. Upon written
request by the sheriff, the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption shall provide
an affidavit of allowable costs to the sheriff within seven days of the date of the request by the
sheriff. If the mortgagor does not redeem within seven days after the affidavit is filed, the holder of
the sheriff's certificate may file a supplemental affidavit if additional allowable costs are incurred
during the redemption period. If the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption
fails to respond to the sheriff's request within seven days, the sheriff may calculate a redemption
amount pursuant to section 580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that
amount. If the time allowed to redeem is less than seven days from the expiration of the redemption
period, the sheriff shall make a reasonable effort to request the affidavit of allowable costs in
writing from the holder of the sheriff's certificate, its agent, or attorney before issuing a certificate
of redemption. If the affidavit of allowable costs is not provided more than one business day before
the expiration of the redemption period, at any time one business day or less before the expiration
of the redemption period, the sheriff may calculate a redemption amount pursuant to section
580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that amount. The amount calculated
by the sheriff, absent malfeasance by the sheriff, binds the holder of the sheriff's certificate even if
the amount calculated by the sheriff is less than the actual amount due.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for excessive costs. At any time within one year after the expiration of the
mortgagor's redemption period, the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns may recover from the holder
of the sheriff's certificate three times the amount of any sums declared as costs or disbursements
on the affidavit of allowable costs but not actually paid by the holder, or three times the amount of
any sums determined to exceed a reasonable cost for the declared item where the excess has been
retained by the lender, unless the disputed amounts are paid to the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns
prior to entry of judgment.
    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 582.031, is amended to read:
    582.031 LIMITED RIGHT OF ENTRY.
     Subdivision 1. Right of entry. If premises described in a mortgage or sheriff's certificate are
vacant or unoccupied, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate or the holder's agents and
contractors may, but is under no obligation to, enter upon the premises to protect the premises
from waste, until the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate receives notice that the premises
are occupied. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate does not become a mortgagee in
possession by taking actions authorized under this section. An affidavit of the sheriff, the holder
of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate, or a person acting on behalf of the holder, describing the
premises and stating that the same are vacant or unoccupied, is prima facie evidence of the facts
stated in the affidavit and is entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder or the registrar
of titles in the county where the premises are located, if it contains a legal description of the premises.

standards for public safety and sanitation: make reasonable periodic inspections, install or change

    (b) For purposes of this section, the person's estate consists of: (1) ­h    t­­ i­ the person's probate
                                                                                   e­r
estate; (2) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in real property the person owned
as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with a right of survivorship at the time of the person's death; (3) all
of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in securities the person owned in beneficiary
form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's death, to the
extent they become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-307; ­         an

interests in joint accounts, multiple party accounts, and pay on death accounts, or the proceeds of
those accounts, as provided under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death
to the extent they become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and (5) the person's
legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property transferred under a transfer
on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds from the subsequent sale of the person's
interest in the real property. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency
with a claim under this section shall be a creditor under section 524.6-307.
    (c) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, the person's life estate or joint tenancy
interest in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985
on the date of the person's death shall not end upon the person's death and shall continue as provided
in this subdivision. The life estate in the person's estate shall be that portion of the interest in the real
property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate
as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who
was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy
interest in real property in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest the person would have
owned in the jointly held interest in the property had they and the other owners held title to the
property as tenants in common on the date the person died.
    (d) The court upon its own motion, or upon motion by the personal representative or any
interested party, may enter an order directing the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants and their
spouses, if any, to sign all documents, take all actions, and otherwise fully cooperate with the
personal representative and the court to liquidate the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interests
in the estate and deliver the cash or the proceeds of those interests to the personal representative
and provide for any legal and equitable sanctions as the court deems appropriate to enforce and
carry out the order, including an award of reasonable attorney fees.
    (e) The personal representative may make, execute, and deliver any conveyances or other
documents necessary to convey the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the estate that
are necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash the decedent's interest or for any other purposes.
    (f) Subject to administration, all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, directly and
immediately related to liquidating the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the decedent's
estate, shall be paid from the gross proceeds of the liquidation allocable to the decedent's interest
and the net proceeds shall be turned over to the personal representative and applied to payment of
the claim presented under this section.
    (g) The personal representative shall bring a motion in the district court in which the estate is
being probated to compel the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants to account for and deliver
to the personal representative all or any part of the proceeds of any sale, mortgage, transfer,
conveyance, or any disposition of real property allocable to the decedent's life estate or joint
tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash
the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal

representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to,
ordering a partition of real estate under chapter 558 necessary to make the value of the decedent's
life estate or joint tenancy interest available to the estate for payment of a claim under this section.
    (h) Subject to administration, the personal representative shall use all of the cash or proceeds of
interests to pay an allowable claim under this section. The remaindermen or surviving joint tenants
and their spouses, if any, may enter into a written agreement with the personal representative or the
claimant to settle and satisfy obligations imposed at any time before or after a claim is filed.
    (i) The personal representative may, at their discretion, provide any or all of the other owners,
remaindermen, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's estate's
interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others, if the
personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the decedent's
predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this
section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the estate has other
assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement under paragraph (h),
or if the claim, as allowed, has been paid in full or to the full extent of the assets the estate has
available to pay it. The affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county recorder or filed in
the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is located. Except as
provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit shall terminate the
decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant with others.
The affidavit shall: (1) be signed by the personal representative; (2) identify the decedent and the
interest being terminated; (3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that
created the interest in real property being terminated; (4) legally describe the affected real property;
(5) state that the personal representative has determined that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed
under this section; (6) state that the decedent's estate has other assets sufficient to pay the claim, as
presented, or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant
and the other owners or remaindermen or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed
under this subdivision; and (7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest
under this subdivision, and any other contents as may be appropriate.
The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall
be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording
information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall
be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.
   (j) The holder of a lien arising under subdivision 1c shall release the lien at the holder's expense
against an interest terminated under paragraph (h) to the extent of the termination.
    (k) If a lien arising under subdivision 1c is not released under paragraph (j), prior to closing the
estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen or
surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work
a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder
interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the
property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.

   Subd. 1i. Estates of persons receiving medical assistance and survived by others. (a) For
9986                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [113TH DAY

purposes of this subdivision, the person's estate consists of the person's probate estate and all of the
person's interests in real property the person owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant at the time of the
person's death and the person's legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property
transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds
from the subsequent sale of the person's interest in the transferred real property.
    (b) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, this subdivision applies if a person received
medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section but for the fact the person was
survived by a spouse or by a person listed in subdivision 3, or if subdivision 4 applies to a claim
arising under this section.
    (c) The person's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property not subject to a medical
assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985 on the date of the person's death shall not end
upon death and shall continue as provided in this subdivision. The life estate in the estate shall be
the portion of the interest in the property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate
percentage factor for the life estate as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care
program's manual for a person who was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of
the person's death. The joint tenancy interest in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest
the medical assistance recipient would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had
they and the other owners held title to the property as tenants in common on the date the medical
assistance recipient died.
    (d) The county agency shall file a claim in the estate under this section on behalf of the claimant
who shall be the commissioner of human services, notwithstanding that the decedent is survived by
a spouse or a person listed in subdivision 3. The claim, as allowed, shall not be paid by the estate
and shall be disposed of as provided in this paragraph. The personal representative or the court shall
make, execute, and deliver a lien in favor of the claimant on the decedent's interest in real property in
the estate in the amount of the allowed claim on forms provided by the commissioner to the county
agency filing the lien. The lien shall bear interest as provided under section 524.3-806, shall attach
to the property it describes upon filing or recording, and shall remain a lien on the real property it
describes for a period of 20 years from the date it is filed or recorded. The lien shall be a disposition
of the claim sufficient to permit the estate to close.
    (e) The state or county agency shall file or record the lien in the office of the county recorder
or registrar of titles for each county in which any of the real property is located. The recorder or
registrar of titles shall accept the lien for filing or recording. All recording or filing fees shall be paid
by the Department of Human Services. The recorder or registrar of titles shall mail the recorded lien
to the Department of Human Services. The lien need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as
a condition of recording or filing. Upon recording or filing of a lien against a life estate or a joint
tenancy interest, the interest subject to the lien shall merge into the remainder interest or the interest
the recipient and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent
of the decedent's interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death as determined under this
section.
    (f) The department shall make no adjustment or recovery under the lien until after the decedent's
spouse, if any, has died, and only at a time when the decedent has no surviving child described in
subdivision 3. The estate, any owner of an interest in the property which is or may be subject to
the lien, or any other interested party, may voluntarily pay off, settle, or otherwise satisfy the claim
secured or to be secured by the lien at any time before or after the lien is filed or recorded. Such

payoffs, settlements, and satisfactions shall be deemed to be voluntary repayments of past medical
assistance payments for the benefit of the deceased recipient, and neither the process of settling the
claim, the payment of the claim, or the acceptance of a payment shall constitute an adjustment or
recovery that is prohibited under this subdivision.
    (g) The lien under this subdivision may be enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided by
law for the enforcement of judgment liens against real estate or by a foreclosure by action under
chapter 581. When the lien is paid, satisfied, or otherwise discharged, the state or county agency
shall prepare and file a release of lien at its own expense. No action to foreclose the lien shall be
commenced unless the lien holder has first given 30 days' prior written notice to pay the lien to the
owners and parties in possession of the property subject to the lien. The notice shall: (1) include the
name, address, and telephone number of the lien holder; (2) describe the lien; (3) give the amount
of the lien; (4) inform the owner or party in possession that payment of the lien in full must be made
to the lien holder within 30 days after service of the notice or the lien holder may begin proceedings
to foreclose the lien; and (5) be served by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested,
ordinary first class mail, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
in which any part of the property is located. Service of the notice shall be complete upon mailing or
publication.

such a plat,
is presented to the county auditor for transfer, the auditor shall ascertain from the records if there
be taxes delinquent upon the land described therein, or if it has been sold for taxes. An assignment
of a sheriff's or referee's certificate of sale, when the certificate of sale describes real estate,
and certificates of redemption from mortgage or lien foreclosure sales, when the certificate of
redemption encompasses real estate and is issued to a junior creditor, are considered instruments
conveying land for the purposes of this section and section 272.121. If there are taxes delinquent,
the auditor shall certify to the same; and upon payment of such taxes, or in case no taxes are
delinquent, shall transfer the land upon the books of the auditor's office, and note upon the
instrument, over official signature, the words, "no delinquent taxes and transfer entered," or, if the
land described has been sold or assigned to an actual purchaser for taxes, the words "paid by sale
of land described within;" and, unless such statement is made upon such instrument, the county
recorder or the registrar of titles shall refuse to receive or record the same; provided, that sheriff's
or referees' certificates of sale on execution or foreclosure of a lien or mortgage, certificates of
redemption from mortgage or lien foreclosure sales issued to the redeeming mortgagor or lienee,

deeds under section 507.071, decrees and judgments, receivers receipts, patents, and copies of
town or statutory city plats, in case the original plat filed in the office of the county recorder has
been lost or destroyed, and the instruments releasing, removing and discharging reversionary and
forfeiture provisions affecting title to land and instruments releasing, removing or discharging
easement rights in land or building or other restrictions, may be recorded without such certificate;
and, provided that instruments conveying land and, as appurtenant thereto an easement over
adjacent tract or tracts of land, may be recorded without such certificate as to the land covered by
such easement; and provided further, that any instrument granting an easement made in favor of
any public utility or pipe line for conveying gas, liquids or solids in suspension, in the nature of a
right-of-way over, along, across or under a tract of land may be recorded without such certificate
as to the land covered by such easement. Documents governing homeowners associations of
condominiums, townhouses, common interest ownership communities, and other planned unit
developments may be recorded without the auditor's certificate to the extent provided in section
515B.1-116(f).
    A deed of distribution made by a personal representative in a probate proceeding, a decree, or a
judgment that conveys land shall be presented to the county auditor, who shall transfer the land upon
the books of the auditor's office and note upon the instrument, over official signature, the words,
"transfer entered", and the instrument may then be recorded. A decree or judgment that affects title
to land but does not convey land may be recorded without presentation to the auditor.
    A violation of this section by the county recorder or the registrar of titles shall be a gross
misdemeanor, and, in addition to the punishment therefor, the recorder or registrar shall be liable
to the grantee of any instrument so recorded for the amount of any damages sustained.
    When, as a condition to permitting the recording of deed or other instrument affecting the title to
real estate previously forfeited to the state under the provisions of sections 281.16 to 281.25, county
officials, after such real estate has been purchased or repurchased, have required the payment of
taxes erroneously assumed to have accrued against such real estate after forfeiture and before the
date of purchase or repurchase, the sum required to be so paid shall be refunded to the persons
entitled thereto out of moneys in the funds in which the sum so paid was placed. Delinquent taxes
are those taxes deemed delinquent under section 279.02.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 287.22, is amended to read:
   287.22 EXEMPTIONS.
   The tax imposed by section 287.21 does not apply to:
    (1) An executory contract for the sale of real property under which the purchaser is entitled to

       Sec. 5. [507.071] TRANSFER ON DEATH DEEDS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following terms have the

assistance benefits from the estates of decedents.

transfer on death deed.
   (d) "Owner" means a person having an ownership or other interest in all or part of the real
property to be conveyed or transferred by a transfer on death deed. Owner does not include a spouse
who joins in a transfer on death deed solely for the purpose of conveying or releasing statutory or

   (f) "State agency" means the Department of Human Services or any successor agency.
   (g) "Transfer on death deed" means a deed authorized under this section.
   Subd. 2. Effect of transfer on death deed. A deed that conveys or assigns an interest in real
property, including a mortgage, judgment, or any other lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary
and that expressly states that the deed is only effective on the death of one or more of the grantor
owners, transfers the interest to the grantee beneficiary upon the death of the grantor owner upon
whose death the conveyance or transfer is stated to be effective, but subject to the survivorship
provisions and requirements of section 524.2-702. A transfer on death deed must comply with all
provisions of Minnesota law applicable to deeds of real property including, but not limited to, the
provisions of sections 507.02, 507.24, 507.34, 508.48, and 508A.48.
    Subd. 3. Rights of creditors and rights of the state and county under sections 246.53,
256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, and 514.981. The interest transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer
on death deed after the death of a grantor owner is transferred subject to all effective conveyances,
assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, judgments, tax liens, and
other encumbrances made by the grantor owner or to which the property was subject during the
grantor owner's lifetime, including but not limited to, any claim by a surviving spouse or any claim
or lien by the state or county agency authorized by section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or
514.981, if other assets of the deceased owner's estate are insufficient to pay the amount of any
such claim. A beneficiary to whom the interest is transferred after the death of a grantor owner
shall be liable to account to the state or county agency with a claim or lien authorized by section
246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or 514.981, to the extent necessary to discharge any such
claim remaining unpaid after application of the assets of the deceased grantor owner's estate, but
such liability shall be limited to the value of the interest transferred to the beneficiary. To establish
compliance with this subdivision and subdivision 23, the beneficiary must record a clearance
certificate issued in accordance with subdivision 23 in each county in which the real property
described in the transfer on death deed is located.
   Subd. 4. Multiple grantee beneficiaries. A transfer on death deed may designate multiple
grantee beneficiaries to take title as joint tenants, as tenants in common or in any other form of
ownership or tenancy that is valid under the laws of this state.
    Subd. 5. Successor grantee beneficiaries. A transfer on death deed may designate one or more
successor grantee beneficiaries or a class of successor grantee beneficiaries, or both. If the transfer on
death deed designates successor grantee beneficiaries or a class of successor grantee beneficiaries,
the deed shall state the condition under which the interest of the successor grantee beneficiaries
would vest.
    Subd. 6. Multiple joint tenant grantors. If an interest in real property is owned as joint tenants,
a transfer on death deed executed by all of the owners that conveys an interest in real property to
one or more grantee beneficiaries transfers the interest to the grantee beneficiary or beneficiaries
effective only after the death of the last surviving grantor owner. If the last surviving joint tenant
owner did not execute the transfer on death deed, the deed is ineffective to transfer any interest and
the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy is not severed or affected by the subsequent execution
of a transfer on death deed and the right of a surviving joint tenant owner who did not execute the
transfer on death deed shall prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a transfer on death deed
unless the deed specifically states that it severs the joint tenancy ownership.
113TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                         9991

   Subd. 7. Execution by attorney-in-fact. A transfer on death deed may be executed by a duly
appointed attorney-in-fact pursuant to a power of attorney which grants the attorney-in-fact the
authority to execute deeds.
     Subd. 8. Recording requirements and authorization. A transfer on death deed is valid if the
deed is recorded in a county in which at least a part of the real property described in the deed is
located and is recorded before the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the conveyance or
transfer is effective. A transfer on death deed is not effective for purposes of section 507.34, 508.47,
or 508A.47 until the deed is recorded in the county in which the real property is located. When a
transfer on death deed is presented for recording, no certification by the county auditor as to transfer
of ownership and current and delinquent taxes shall be required or made and the transfer on death
deed shall not be required to be accompanied by a certificate of real estate value. A transfer on death
deed that otherwise satisfies all statutory requirements for recording may be recorded and shall be
accepted for recording in the county in which the property described in the deed is located. If any
part of the property described in the transfer on death deed is registered property, the registrar of
titles shall accept the transfer on death deed for recording only if at least one of the grantors who
executes the transfer on death deed appears of record to have an ownership interest in the property
described in the deed. No certification or approval of a transfer on death deed shall be required of
the examiner of titles prior to recording of the deed in the office of the registrar of titles.
    Subd. 9. Deed to trustee or other entity. A transfer on death deed may transfer an interest in
real property to the trustee of an inter vivos trust even if the trust is revocable, to the trustee of a
testamentary trust or to any other entity legally qualified to hold title to real property under the laws
of this state.
    Subd. 10. Revocation or modification of transfer on death deed. (a) A transfer on death deed
may be revoked at any time by the grantor owner or, if there is more than one grantor owner, by
any of the grantor owners. To be effective, the revocation must be recorded in the county in which
at least a part of the real property is located before the death of the grantor owner or owners who
execute the revocation. The revocation is not effective for purposes of section 507.34, 508.47, or
508A.47 until the revocation is recorded in the county in which the real property is located. Subject
to subdivision 6, if the real property is owned as joint tenants and if the revocation is not executed
by all of the grantor owners, the revocation is not effective unless executed by the last surviving
grantor owner.
    (b) If a grantor owner conveys to a third party, subsequent to the recording of the transfer on
death deed, by means other than a transfer on death deed, all or a part of such grantor owner's interest
in the property described in the transfer on death deed, no transfer of the conveyed interest shall
occur on such grantor owner's death and the transfer on death deed shall be ineffective as to the
conveyed or transferred interests, but the transfer on death deed remains effective with respect to
the conveyance or transfer on death of any other interests described in the transfer on death deed
owned by the grantor owner at the time of the grantor owner's death.
    (c) A transfer on death deed is a "governing instrument" within the meaning of section 524.2-804
and, except as may otherwise be specifically provided for in the transfer on death deed, is subject to
the same provisions as to revocation, revival, and nonrevocation set forth in section 524.2-804.
  Subd. 11. Antilapse; deceased beneficiary; words of survivorship. (a) If a grantee beneficiary
who is a grandparent or lineal descendant of a grandparent of the grantor owner fails to survive the
9992                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [113TH DAY

grantor owner, the issue of the deceased grantee beneficiary who survive the grantor owner take
in place of the deceased grantee beneficiary. If they are all of the same degree of kinship to the
deceased grantee beneficiary, they take equally. If they are of unequal degree, those of more remote
degree take by right of representation.
    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision, words of survivorship such as, in a conveyance to an
individual, "if he or she survives me," or, in a class gift, to "my surviving children," are a sufficient
indication of intent to condition the conveyance or transfer upon the beneficiary surviving the grantor
owner.
    Subd. 12. Lapse. If all beneficiaries and all successor beneficiaries, if any, designated in a transfer
on death deed, and also all successor beneficiaries who would take under the antilapse provisions of
subdivision 11, fail to survive the grantor owner or the last survivor of the grantor owners if there
are multiple grantor owners, if the beneficiary is a trust which has been revoked prior to the grantor
owner's death, or if the beneficiary is an entity no longer in existence at the grantor owner's death,
no transfer shall occur and the transfer on death deed is void.
    Subd. 13. Multiple transfer on death deeds. If a grantor owner executes and records more than
one transfer on death deed conveying the same interest in real property or a greater interest in the
real property, the transfer on death deed that has the latest acknowledgment date and that is recorded
before the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the conveyance or transfer is conditioned
is the effective transfer on death deed and all other transfer on death deeds, if any, executed by the
grantor owner or the grantor owners are ineffective to transfer any interest and are void.
    Subd. 14. Nonademption; unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation, or insurance; sale by
conservator or guardian. If at the time of the death of the grantor owner upon whose death the
conveyance or transfer is stated to be effective, the grantor owner did not own a part or all of the real
property described in the transfer on death deed, no conveyance or transfer to the beneficiary of the
nonowned part of the real property shall occur upon the death of the grantor owner and the transfer
on death deed is void as to the nonowned part of the real property, but the beneficiary shall have
the same rights to unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation or insurance, and, if sold by a conservator
or guardian of the grantor owner during the grantor owner's lifetime, the same rights to a general
pecuniary devise, as that of a specific devisee as set forth in section 524.2-606.
    Subd. 15. Nonexoneration. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision 3, a conveyance or
transfer under a transfer on death deed passes the described property subject to any mortgage or
security interest existing at the date of death of the grantor owner, without right of exoneration,
regardless of any statutory obligations to pay the grantor owner's debts upon death and regardless
of a general directive in the grantor owner's will to pay debts.
   Subd. 16. Disclaimer by beneficiary. A grantee beneficiary's interest under a transfer on death
deed may be disclaimed as provided in section 501B.86, or as otherwise provided by law.
     Subd. 17. Effect on other conveyances. This section does not prohibit other methods of
conveying property that are permitted by law and that have the effect of postponing ownership
or enjoyment of an interest in real property until the death of the owner. This section does not
invalidate any deed that is not a transfer on death deed and that is otherwise effective to convey
title to the interests and estates described in the deed that is not recorded until after the death of
the owner.
113TH DAY]                            THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                           9993

    Subd. 18. Notice, consent, and delivery not required. The signature, consent or agreement of,
or notice to, a grantee beneficiary under a transfer on death deed, or delivery of the transfer on death
deed to the grantee beneficiary, is not required for any purpose during the lifetime of the grantor
owner.
   Subd. 19. Nonrevocation by will. A transfer on death deed that is executed, acknowledged, and
recorded in accordance with this section is not revoked by the provisions of a will.
    Subd. 20. Proof of survivorship and clearance from public assistance claims and liens;
recording. An affidavit of identity and survivorship with a certified copy of a record of death as
an attachment may be combined with a clearance certificate under this section and the combined
documents may be recorded separately or as one document in each county in which the real estate
described in the clearance certificate is located. The affidavit, record of death, and clearance
certificate, whether combined or separate shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in each,
and the registrar of titles may rely on the statements to transfer title to the property described in the
clearance certificate.
    Subd. 21. After-acquired property. Except as provided in this subdivision, a transfer on death
deed is not effective to transfer any interest in real property acquired by a grantor owner subsequent
to the date of signing of a transfer on death deed. A grantor owner may provide by specific language
in a transfer on death deed that the transfer on death deed will apply to any interest in the described
property acquired by the grantor owner after the signing or recording of the deed.
    Subd. 22. Anticipatory alienation prohibited. The interest of a grantee beneficiary under a
transfer on death deed which has not yet become effective is not subject to alienation; assignment;
encumbrance; appointment or anticipation by the beneficiary; garnishment; attachment; execution or
bankruptcy proceedings; claims for alimony, support, or maintenance; payment of other obligations
by any person against the beneficiary; or any other transfer, voluntary or involuntary, by or from
any beneficiary.
     Subd. 23. Clearance for public assistance claims and liens. Any person claiming an interest
in real property conveyed or transferred by a transfer on death deed, or the person's attorney or
other agent, may apply to the county agency in the county in which the real property is located for a
clearance certificate for the real property described in the transfer on death deed. The application for
a clearance certificate and the clearance certificate must contain the legal description of each parcel
of property covered by the clearance certificate. The county agency shall provide a sufficient number
of clearance certificates to allow a clearance certificate to be recorded in each county in which the
real property described in the transfer on death deed is located. The real property described in the
clearance certificate is bound by any conditions or other requirements imposed by the county agency
as specified in the clearance certificate. If the real property is registered property, a new certificate of
title must not be issued until the clearance certificate is recorded. If the clearance certificate shows
the continuation of a medical assistance claim or lien after issuance of the clearance certificate,
the real property remains subject to the claim or lien. If the real property is registered property,
the clearance certificate must be carried forward as a memorial in any new certificate of title. The
application shall contain the same information and shall be submitted, processed, and resolved in the
same manner and on the same terms and conditions as provided in section 525.313 for a clearance
certificate in a decree of descent proceeding, except that a copy of a notice of hearing does not
have to accompany the application. The application may contain a statement that the applicant, after
reasonably diligent inquiry, is not aware of the existence of a predeceased spouse or the existence
9994                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [113TH DAY

of a claim which could be recovered under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or 514.981.
If the county agency determines that a claim or lien exists under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16,
261.04, or 514.981, the provisions of section 525.313 shall apply to collection, compromise, and
settlement of the claim or lien. A person claiming an interest in real property transferred or conveyed
by a transfer on death deed may petition or move the district court, as appropriate, in the county in
which the real property is located or in the county in which a probate proceeding affecting the estate
of the grantor of the transfer on death deed is pending, for an order allowing sale of the real property
free and clear of any public assistance claim or lien but subject to disposition of the sale proceeds
as provided in section 525.313. On a showing of good cause and subject to such notice as the court
may require, the court without hearing may issue an order allowing the sale free and clear of any
public assistance claim or lien on such terms and conditions as the court deems advisable to protect
the interests of the state or county agency.
    Subd. 24. Form of transfer on death deed. A transfer on death deed may be substantially in
the following form:
                                         Transfer on Death Deed

             County, Minnesota, affecting real property legally described as follows:

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 508.52, is amended to read:
  508.52 CONVEYANCE; CANCELLATION OF OLD AND ISSUANCE OF NEW
CERTIFICATE.
     An owner of registered land who desires to convey the land, or a portion thereof, in fee, shall
execute a deed of conveyance, and fi     ­­e
                                          l­ record the deed with the registrar. The deed of conveyance
shall be fi­­e d recorded and endorsed with the number and place of registration of the certificate
             l­­
of title. Before canceling the outstanding certificate of title the registrar shall show by memorial
thereon the registration of the deed on the basis of which it is canceled. The encumbrances, claims,
or interests adverse to the title of the registered owner shall be stated upon the new certificate, except
so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged. The registrar shall not carry forward as
a memorial on the new certificate of title any memorials of a transfer on death deed if the grantors
of the transfer on death deed retain no fee interest in the land covered by the new certificate. The
certificate of title shall be marked "Canceled" by the registrar, who shall enter in the register a new
certificate of title to the grantee and prepare and deliver to the grantee a copy of the new certificate
of title. If a deed in fee is for a portion of the land described in a certificate of title, the memorial
of the deed entered by the registrar shall include the legal description contained in the deed and the
registrar shall enter a new certificate of title to the grantee for the portion of the land conveyed and,
except as otherwise provided in this section, issue a residue certificate of title to the grantor for the
portion of the land not conveyed. The registrar shall prepare and deliver to each of the parties a
copy of their respective certificates of title. In lieu of canceling the grantor's certificate of title and
issuing a residue certificate to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed, the registrar may
if the grantor's deed does not divide a parcel of unplatted land, and in the absence of a request to the
contrary by the registered owner, mark by the land description on the certificate of title "Part of land
conveyed, see memorials." The fee for a residue certificate of title shall be paid to the registrar only
when the grantor's certificate of title is canceled after the conveyance by the grantor of a portion
of the land described in the grantor's certificate of title. When two or more successive conveyances
of the same property are filed for registration on the same day the registrar may enter a certificate
in favor of the grantee or grantees in the last of the successive conveyances, and the memorial of
the previous deed or deeds entered on the prior certificate of title shall have the same force and
effect as though the prior certificate of title had been entered in favor of the grantee or grantees in
the earlier deed or deeds in the successive conveyances. The fees for the registration of the earlier
deed or deeds shall be the same as the fees prescribed for the entry of memorials. The registrar of
titles, with the consent of the transferee, may mark "See memorials for new owner(s)" by the names
of the registered owners on the certificate of title and also add to the memorial of the transferring
conveyance a statement that the memorial shall serve in lieu of a new certificate of title in favor of
the grantee or grantees therein noted and may refrain from canceling the certificate of title until the
time it is canceled by a subsequent transfer, and the memorial showing such transfer of title shall

have the same effect as the entry of a new certificate of title for the land described in the certificate
of title; the fee for the registration of a conveyance without cancellation of the certificate of title
shall be the same as the fee prescribed for the entry of a memorial.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 508A.52, is amended to read:
   508A.52 CONVEYANCE; CANCELLATION OF OLD AND ISSUANCE OF NEW CPT.
     An owner of land registered under sections 508A.01 to 508A.85 who desires to convey the
land, or a portion of it, in fee, shall execute a deed of conveyance, and fi   ­­e
                                                                                 l­ record the deed with
the registrar. The deed of conveyance shall be fi   ­­e
                                                     l­d­ recorded and endorsed with the number and
place of registration of the CPT. Before canceling the outstanding CPT, the registrar shall show by
memorial on it the registration of the deed on the basis of which it is canceled. The encumbrances,
claims, or interests adverse to the title of the registered owner shall be stated upon the new CPT,
except so far as they may be simultaneously released or discharged. The registrar shall not carry
forward as a memorial on the new CPT any memorials of a transfer on death deed if the grantors of
the transfer on death deed retain no fee interest in the real property covered by the new CPT. The
CPT shall be marked "Canceled" by the registrar, who shall enter in the register a new CPT to the
grantee, and prepare and deliver to the grantee a copy of the new CPT. If a deed in fee is for a portion
of the land described in a CPT, the memorial of the deed entered by the registrar shall include the
legal description contained in the deed and the registrar shall enter a new CPT to the grantee for
the portion of the land conveyed and, except as otherwise provided in this section, issue a residue
CPT to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed. The registrar shall prepare and deliver
to each of the parties a copy of their respective C­P­T­­s CPT's. In lieu of canceling the grantor's CPT
and issuing a residue CPT to the grantor for the portion of the land not conveyed, the registrar may
if the grantor's deed does not divide a parcel of unplatted land, and in the absence of a request to the
contrary by the registered owner, mark by the land description on the CPT "Part of land conveyed,
see memorials." The fee for a residue CPT shall be paid to the registrar only when the grantor's CPT
is canceled after the conveyance by the grantor of a portion of the land described in the grantor's
CPT. When two or more successive conveyances of the same property are filed for registration on
the same day the registrar may enter a CPT in favor of the grantee or grantees in the last of the
successive conveyances, and the memorial of the previous deed or deeds entered on the prior CPT
shall have the same force and effect as though the prior CPT had been entered in favor of the grantee
or grantees in the earlier deed or deeds in the successive conveyances. The fees for the registration
of the earlier deed or deeds shall be the same as the fees prescribed for the entry of memorials. The
registrar of titles, with the consent of the transferee, may mark "See memorials for new owner(s)"
by the names of the registered owners on the CPT and also add to the memorial of the transferring
conveyance a statement that the memorial shall serve in lieu of a new CPT in favor of the grantee
or grantees noted in it and may refrain from canceling the CPT until the time it is canceled by a
subsequent transfer, and the memorial showing the transfer of title shall have the same effect as the
entry of a new CPT for the land described in the CPT. The fee for the registration of a conveyance
without cancellation of the CPT shall be the same as the fee prescribed for the entry of a memorial.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.2-702, is amended to read:
  524.2-702 REQUIREMENT OF SURVIVAL FOR 120 HOURS FOR DEVISEES,
BENEFICIARIES OF CERTAIN TRUSTS, AND APPOINTEES OF CERTAIN POWERS
OF APPOINTMENT; SIMULTANEOUS DEATH ACT FOR OTHER CASES.
113TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                         9997

    (a) Requirement of survival for 120 hours. A beneficiary of a trust in which the grantor has
reserved a power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the provisions of the trust who fails to survive
the grantor by 120 hours, a devisee who fails to survive the testator by 120 hours, a beneficiary named
in a transfer on death deed under section 507.071 who fails to survive by 120 hours the grantor owner
upon whose death the conveyance to the beneficiary becomes effective, or an appointee of a power
of appointment taking effect at the death of the holder of the power who fails to survive the holder
of the power by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the grantor, grantor owner testator, or
holder of the power for purposes of determining title to property passing by the trust instrument, by
the testator's will, by the transfer on death deed, or by the exercise of the power of appointment.
    (b)(1) Title to property in other cases. In cases not governed by section 524.2-104 or paragraph
(a), where the title to property or the devolution thereof depends upon priority of death and there
is no sufficient evidence that the persons have died otherwise than simultaneously, the property of
each person shall be disposed of as if the person had survived, except as provided otherwise in this
paragraph.
    (2) Division of property. Where two or more beneficiaries are designated to take successively
by reason of survivorship under another person's disposition of property and there is no sufficient
evidence that these beneficiaries have died otherwise than simultaneously the property thus disposed
of shall be divided into as many equal portions as there are successive beneficiaries and these
portions shall be distributed respectively to those who would have taken in the event that each
designated beneficiary had survived.
    (3) Division of property. Where there is no sufficient evidence that two joint tenants or tenants
by the entirety have died otherwise than simultaneously the property so held shall be distributed
one-half as if one had survived and one-half as if the other had survived. If there are more than two
joint tenants and all of them have so died the property thus distributed shall be in the proportion that
one bears to the whole number of joint tenants.
    (4) Division of property. Where the insured and the beneficiary in a policy of life or accident
insurance have died and there is no sufficient evidence that they have died otherwise than
simultaneously the proceeds of the policy shall be distributed as if the insured had survived the
beneficiary.
    (c) Not retroactive. This section does not apply to the distribution of the property of a person
who has died before it takes effect. Paragraph (a) applies only to persons who die on or after August
1, 1999.
    (d) Application. This section does not apply in the case of wills, trusts, deeds, contracts of
insurance, or documents exercising powers of appointment wherein provision has been made for
distribution of property different from the provisions of this section. Paragraph (a) does not apply to
trusts which are part of a qualified or nonqualified retirement plan or individual retirement accounts.
   Sec. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This article is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to instruments of conveyance of real property
recorded on or after that date, regardless of an instrument's date of execution.

in those pilot projects are deemed to meet the requirements of this section.
   (2)(i) A county that participated in the pilot project for the electronic filing of real estate
documents under the task force created in Laws 2000, chapter 391, may continue to record or file
documents electronically, if:
   (A) the county complies with standards adopted by the task force; and

compliance with paragraph (b), clause (2), of this section by the county board and county recorder
of the county to implement electronic filing under this section.

The filing of such lis pendens at the time of filing the complaint and before the commencement of
the action shall have no force, effect, or validity against the premises described in the lis pendens,
unless the filing of the complaint is followed by the service of the summons in the action within 90
days after the filing of the complaint therein. Any party claiming any title or interest in or to the real
property involved or affected may on such notice as the court shall in each case prescribe, make
application to the district court in the county in which the action is pending or in which the real
property involved or affected is situated, for an order discharging the lis pendens of record, when
any such action has not been brought on for trial within two years after the filing of the lis pendens
and in case the court orders the lis pendens discharged of record upon the filing of a certified copy
of the order of the court in the office of the county recorder, where the real property is situated, the
lis pendens shall be void and of no force nor effect.

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.2-402, is amended to read:
     524.2-402 DESCENT OF HOMESTEAD.
   (a) If there is a surviving spouse, the homestead, including a manufactured home which is the
family residence, descends free from any testamentary or other disposition of it to which the spouse
has not consented in writing or as provided by law, as follows:
     (1) if there is no surviving descendant of decedent, to the spouse; or
   (2) if there are surviving descendants of decedent, then to the spouse for the term of the spouse's
natural life and the remainder in equal shares to the decedent's descendants by representation.
    (b) If there is no surviving spouse and the homestead has not been disposed of by will it descends
as other real estate.
     (c) If the homestead passes by descent or will to the spouse or decedent's descendants or to a
trustee of a trust of which the spouse or the decedent's descendants are the sole current beneficiaries,
it is exempt from all debts which were not valid charges on it at the time of decedent's death except
that the homestead is subject to a claim filed pursuant to section 246.53 for state hospital care or
256B.15 for medical assistance benefits. If the homestead passes to a person other than a spouse or
decedent's descendants or to a trustee of a trust of which the spouse or the decedent's descendants
are the sole current beneficiaries, it is subject to the payment of expenses of administration, funeral
expenses, expenses of last illness, taxes, and debts. The claimant may seek to enforce a lien or other
charge against a homestead so exempted by an appropriate action in the district court.
    (d) For purposes of this section, except as provided in section 524.2-301, the surviving spouse
is deemed to consent to any testamentary or other disposition of the homestead to which the spouse
has not previously consented in writing unless the spouse files in the manner provided in section
524.2-211, paragraph (f), a petition that asserts the homestead rights provided to the spouse by this
section.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-801, is amended to read:
     524.3-801 NOTICE TO CREDITORS.
    (a) Unless notice has already been given under this section, upon appointment of a general
personal representative in informal proceedings or upon the filing of a petition for formal
appointment of a general personal representative, notice thereof, in the form prescribed by court
rule, shall be given under the direction of the court administrator by publication once a week for

giving the name and address of the general personal representative and notifying creditors of the
estate to present their claims within four months after the date of the court administrator's notice
which is subsequently published or be forever barred, unless they are entitled to further service of
notice under paragraph (b) or (c).

    (d)(1) Effective for decedents dying on or after July 1, 1997, if the decedent or a predeceased
spouse of the decedent received assistance for which a claim could be filed under section
246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, or 261.04, the personal representative or the attorney for the personal
representative shall serve the commissioner of human services with notice in the manner prescribed
in paragraph (c) as soon as practicable after the appointment of the personal representative. The
10004                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [113TH DAY

notice must state the decedent's full name, date of birth, and Social Security number and, to the
extent then known after making a reasonably diligent inquiry, the full name, date of birth, and
Social Security number for each of the decedent's predeceased spouses. The notice may also
contain a statement that, after making a reasonably diligent inquiry, the personal representative
has determined that the decedent did not have any predeceased spouses or that the personal
representative has been unable to determine one or more of the previous items of information for a
predeceased spouse of the decedent. A copy of the notice to creditors must be attached to and be a
part of the notice to the commissioner.
    (2) Notwithstanding a will or other instrument or law to the contrary, except as allowed in this
paragraph, no property subject to administration by the estate may be distributed by the estate or
the personal representative until 70 days after the date the notice is served on the commissioner
as provided in paragraph (c), unless the local agency consents as provided for in clause (6). This
restriction on distribution does not apply to the personal representative's sale of real or personal
property, but does apply to the net proceeds the estate receives from these sales. The personal
representative, or any person with personal knowledge of the facts, may provide an affidavit
containing the description of any real or personal property affected by this paragraph and stating
facts showing compliance with this paragraph. If the affidavit describes real property, it may be
filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles for the county where the
real property is located. This paragraph does not apply to proceedings under sections 524.3-1203
and 525.31, or when a duly authorized agent of a county is acting as the personal representative
of the estate.
    (3) At any time before an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or 524.3-1002,
or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, the personal representative or the attorney
for the personal representative may serve an amended notice on the commissioner to add variations
or other names of the decedent or a predeceased spouse named in the notice, the name of a
predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, to add or correct the date of birth or Social Security
number of a decedent or predeceased spouse named in the notice, or to correct any other deficiency
in a prior notice. The amended notice must state the decedent's name, date of birth, and Social
Security number, the case name, case number, and district court in which the estate is pending, and
the date the notice being amended was served on the commissioner. If the amendment adds the
name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, it must also state that spouse's full name,
date of birth, and Social Security number. The amended notice must be served on the commissioner
in the same manner as the original notice. Upon service, the amended notice relates back to and is
effective from the date the notice it amends was served, and the time for filing claims arising under
section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16 or 261.04 is extended by 60 days from the date of service of the
amended notice. Claims filed during the 60-day period are undischarged and unbarred claims, may
be prosecuted by the entities entitled to file those claims in accordance with section 524.3-1004,
and the limitations in section 524.3-1006 do not apply. The personal representative or any person
with personal knowledge of the facts may provide and file or record an affidavit in the same manner
as provided for in clause (1).
    (4) Within one year after the date an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or
524.3-1002 or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, any person who has an interest
in property that was subject to administration by the estate may serve an amended notice on the
commissioner to add variations or other names of the decedent or a predeceased spouse named in the
notice, the name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice, to add or correct the date of birth

or Social Security number of a decedent or predeceased spouse named in the notice, or to correct
any other deficiency in a prior notice. The amended notice must be served on the commissioner in
the same manner as the original notice and must contain the information required for amendments
under clause (3). If the amendment adds the name of a predeceased spouse omitted from the notice,
it must also state that spouse's full name, date of birth, and Social Security number. Upon service,
the amended notice relates back to and is effective from the date the notice it amends was served. If
the amended notice adds the name of an omitted predeceased spouse or adds or corrects the Social
Security number or date of birth of the decedent or a predeceased spouse already named in the
notice, then, notwithstanding any other laws to the contrary, claims against the decedent's estate on
account of those persons resulting from the amendment and arising under section 246.53, 256B.15,
256D.16, or 261.04 are undischarged and unbarred claims, may be prosecuted by the entities entitled
to file those claims in accordance with section 524.3-1004, and the limitations in section 524.3-1006
do not apply. The person filing the amendment or any other person with personal knowledge of the
facts may provide and file or record an affidavit describing affected real or personal property in the
same manner as clause (1).
    (5) After one year from the date an order or decree is entered under section 524.3-1001 or
524.3-1002, or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, no error, omission, or defect of
any kind in the notice to the commissioner required under this paragraph or in the process of service
of the notice on the commissioner, or the failure to serve the commissioner with notice as required
by this paragraph, makes any distribution of property by a personal representative void or voidable.
The distributee's title to the distributed property shall be free of any claims based upon a failure to
comply with this paragraph.
    (6) The local agency may consent to a personal representative's request to distribute property
subject to administration by the estate to distributees during the 70-day period after service of
notice on the commissioner. The local agency may grant or deny the request in whole or in part and
may attach conditions to its consent as it deems appropriate. When the local agency consents to a
distribution, it shall give the estate a written certificate evidencing its consent to the early distribution
of assets at no cost. The certificate must include the name, case number, and district court in which
the estate is pending, the name of the local agency, describe the specific real or personal property
to which the consent applies, state that the local agency consents to the distribution of the specific
property described in the consent during the 70-day period following service of the notice on the
commissioner, state that the consent is unconditional or list all of the terms and conditions of the
consent, be dated, and may include other contents as may be appropriate. The certificate must be
signed by the director of the local agency or the director's designees and is effective as of the date it
is dated unless it provides otherwise. The signature of the director or the director's designee does not
require any acknowledgment. The certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it states, may
be attached to or combined with a deed or any other instrument of conveyance and, when so attached
or combined, shall constitute a single instrument. If the certificate describes real property, it shall be
accepted for recording or filing by the county recorder or registrar of titles in the county in which the
property is located. If the certificate describes real property and is not attached to or combined with
a deed or other instrument of conveyance, it shall be accepted for recording or filing by the county
recorder or registrar of titles in the county in which the property is located. The certificate constitutes
a waiver of the 70-day period provided for in clause (2) with respect to the property it describes and
is prima facie evidence of service of notice on the commissioner. The certificate is not a waiver or
relinquishment of any claims arising under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, or 261.04, and does
not otherwise constitute a waiver of any of the personal representative's duties under this paragraph.

Distributees who receive property pursuant to a consent to an early distribution shall remain liable
to creditors of the estate as provided for by law.
     (7) All affidavits provided for under this paragraph:
     (i) shall be provided by persons who have personal knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit;
    (ii) may be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles in the county
in which the real property they describe is located for the purpose of establishing compliance with
the requirements of this paragraph; and
     (iii) are prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
    (8) This paragraph applies to the estates of decedents dying on or after July 1, 1997. Clause (5)
also applies with respect to all notices served on the commissioner of human services before July 1,
1997, under Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 2, section 55. All notices served on the commissioner
before July 1, 1997, pursuant to Laws 1996, chapter 451, article 2, section 55, shall be deemed
to be legally sufficient for the purposes for which they were intended, notwithstanding any errors,
omissions or other defects.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-803, is amended to read:
     524.3-803 LIMITATIONS ON PRESENTATION OF CLAIMS.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 3132, relating to financial and medical debt information.
I support efforts to prevent the use of credit ratings or credit reports in providing essential medical
services. However, this bill contains some extremely broad terms that are not defined. The failure
10010                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [113TH DAY

to define key terms will result in confusion as to the scope and application of this bill in relation to
routine medical services and will likely result in significant unintended consequences.
Senate File 3132 broadly prohibits health care providers: (1) from disclosing "financial or medical
debt information"; and (2) from obtaining "financial or medical debt information" from any "entity"
prior to providing the medical services. The bill defines "medical debt information," but fails to
define "financial information."
Prohibitions in this bill relating to the term "medically necessary" are also unclear. The bill does not
define "medically necessary" or identify what entity determines whether services are "medically
necessary." Without further definition, the language suggests that all non-cosmetic medical services
are subject to this bill. This would potentially include all routine and specialized medical care and
elective procedures, provided that the procedure treats an existing medical condition.
If the undefined terms in this bill are interpreted broadly as the terms suggest, this bill could force
significant changes in the delivery of routine medical services in Minnesota and unnecessarily
impact the cost to Minnesotans. The testimony on this bill confirmed that using credit scores and
similar aggregated consumer data is not currently a problem in Minnesota. I am hopeful that the
Legislature can create a bill that addresses the potential problem in a focused and more carefully
drafted manner.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 3132 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                          May 8, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 543, a legislative resolution memorializing Congress to
support the Employee Free Choice Act.
The Employee Free Choice Act (H.R. 800) is a highly controversial federal bill which seeks to
fundamentally alter federal labor laws. The bill would only address federal labor law and does not
have any specialized impact on the state of Minnesota.
The Employee Free Choice Act is fundamentally flawed, and I will not play a role in urging its
passage. Some of the primary flaws include:
    Elimination of Employee Elections. Elections provide process for employees to choose whether
they want union representation through a secret ballot. Neither the union nor the employer knows
how an employee votes. This is an important protection for employees which the bill would
eliminate.
    Forcing Contract Terms on Employers. The National Labor Relations Board will be authorized
to force an employer to implement a collective bargaining agreement imposed by an arbitrator rather
113TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MAY 8, 2008                                      10011

than through agreement between the employer and employees. This represents an unprecedented
government intrusion on the right to bargain freely over working terms and conditions.
   New One-Sided Monetary Penalties. The federal bill creates new monetary penalties against
employers in relation to unfair labor practices. However, no such penalties are created for unfair
labor practices committed by unions and employee groups.
The Employee Free Choice Act is one-sided legislation that seeks to fundamentally alter more than
60 years of federal labor law. If passed, it will disadvantage businesses with U.S. operations and
may encourage more employers to transfer jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs, overseas.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 543 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The purchaser must pay at the time of sale ten percent of the total amount bid and the remainder of
the payment is due within 90 days of the sale date. A person who fails to make final payment within
90 days of the sale date is in default. On default, all right, title, and interest of the purchaser or heirs,
representatives, or assigns of the purchaser in the premises shall terminate without the state doing
any act or thing. A record of the default must be made in the state land records of the commissioner.
