                                                                                 March 27, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
8172                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [96TH DAY

Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 457, Chapter 163. This bill mandates single-member
school board election districts for the election of school board members for Bloomington
Independent School District No. 271. This bill overrides current law which allows these decisions
to be made at the local level.
This bill provides a legislative solution that was not requested by the Bloomington community
or school board. It is also unnecessary because a petition process already exists in state law for
community members to seek division of a school district into election districts. The existing petition
process is not overly burdensome and provides a relatively simple means for local community
members to pursue this option if this is how the community wants to elect school board members.
This bill removes local control and authority from the hands of the Bloomington school district
voters. I am also concerned that this bill is directed only at Bloomington and invites a piecemeal
approach to legislation addressing school district elections.
This bill is opposed by a majority of the Bloomington school board. There is also little evidence
that the changes imposed by this bill reflect the desires of the Bloomington voters. In fact, a public
opinion poll conducted before the November 2007 school board election indicated strong support
for the Bloomington school district and its school board.
While I signed similar legislation for the Minneapolis Public Schools, this situation is different.
Although two members of the Minneapolis Board of Education opposed the legislation, a majority
of the Board did not take a position on the bill. The Minneapolis bill was also supported by the
entire Minneapolis legislative delegation. In this case, some members of the Bloomington legislative
delegation and a majority of the Bloomington school board members oppose this legislation.
This bill may also create unanticipated costs for the Bloomington school district. If a special election
were to be required to fill board vacancies, as is possible under this bill, no additional funds are
provided to the school district for this purpose. The Bloomington school district would be required
to fund the costs of a special election from their existing general fund revenues.
Current law provides a process for Bloomington voters to choose to elect school board members
from designated election districts. A state usurpation of this type of local decision is not warranted.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 457 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                      March 28, 2008

An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
     (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
     (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
     (4) make reports required by the commissioner;

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.04, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Tuition payments. (a) In each odd-numbered year, before March 1, the commissioner
must agree to rates of tuition for Minnesota elementary and secondary pupils attending in other states
for the next two fiscal years when the other state agrees to negotiate tuition rates. The commissioner
must negotiate equal, reciprocal rates with the designated authority in each state for pupils who
reside in an adjoining state and enroll in a Minnesota district. The rates must be at least equal to the
tuition specified in section 124D.05, subdivision 1. If the other state does not agree to negotiate a
general tuition rate, a Minnesota school district may negotiate a tuition rate with the school district

in the other state that sends a pupil to or receives a pupil from the Minnesota school district. The
tuition rate for a pupil with a disability must be equal to the actual cost of instruction and services
provided. The resident district of a Minnesota pupil attending in another state under this section
must pay the amount of tuition agreed upon in this section to the district of attendance, prorated on
the basis of the proportion of the school year attended.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subdivision 9, if an agreement is reached between the
state of Minnesota and an adjoining state pursuant to section 124D.041, the provisions of section
124D.041 and the agreement shall apply to all enrollment transfers between Minnesota and the
adjoining state, and provisions of paragraph (a) and subdivision 9 shall not apply.

aid minus the district's alternative teacher compensation levy. If a district does not levy the entire
amount permitted, the alternative teacher compensation equalization aid must be reduced in

alternative teacher compensation aid and the district's alternative teacher compensation equalization
aid.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.
    (c) For agreements finalized after July 1, 1997, a district may not levy under this subdivision
for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose
of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement
annually without penalty.
   (e) The total levy under this subdivision for a district for any year must not exceed $
                                                                                         ­1­­

expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
    (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
    (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
    (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $25 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), a district that is a member of
the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data processing joint board, that finds it
economically advantageous to enter into a lease purchase agreement for a building for a group of
school districts or special school districts for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion
of lease costs attributed to the district within the total levy limit in paragraph (e).
    Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.51, is amended to read:
    126C.51 APPLICATION OF LIMITING TAX LEGISLATION.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 471.69 or 471.75, or of any other provision of law
which by per capita limitation, local tax rate limitation, or otherwise, limits the power of a district to

   (2) federal school aids to be distributed by or through the department; and
   (3) membership fees and tuition payments from its member school districts.
    The aggregate of such borrowings under this subdivision shall never exceed 75 percent of such
aids, fees, and tuition payments which are receivable by the intermediate school district in the fiscal
year in which the money is borrowed, as estimated and certified by the commissioner.
    (b) The board of an intermediate school district may, upon receipt of a written resolution by
each of its member school districts, pledge the member district's full faith and credit and unlimited
taxing powers to repay each member district's pro rata share of any certificates issued or the amount
paid by the state under section 126C.55, subdivision 2, plus interest, if the revenues specified in
paragraph (a) and any other revenues of the intermediate school district are insufficient to do so.

   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.53, is amended to read:
  126C.53 ENABLING                RESOLUTION;            FORM         OF      CERTIFICATES         OF
INDEBTEDNESS.
    The board of a school district or intermediate school district may authorize and effect such
borrowing, and may issue such certificates of indebtedness upon passage of a resolution specifying
the amount and purposes for which it deems such borrowing is necessary. The resolution must be

8184                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [96TH DAY

debt obligation on the date that payment is due, it must notify the commissioner as soon as possible,
but not less than 15 working days before the date that principal or interest payment is due. The notice
must include the name of the district, an identification of the debt obligation issue in question, the
date the payment is due, the amount of principal and interest due on the payment date, the amount of
principal or interest that the district will be unable to repay on that date, the paying agent for the debt
obligation, the wire transfer instructions to transfer funds to that paying agent, and an indication as
to whether a payment is being requested by the district under this section. If a paying agent becomes
aware of a potential default, it shall inform the commissioner of that fact. After receipt of a notice
which requests a payment under this section, after consultation with the district and the paying agent,
and after verification of the accuracy of the information provided, the commissioner shall notify the
commissioner of finance of the potential default. The notice must include a final figure as to the
amount due that the district will be unable to repay on the date due.
    (b) Except as provided in subdivision 9, upon receipt of this notice from the commissioner, the
commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant and authorize the commissioner of education to pay to
the paying agent for the debt obligation the specified amount on or before the date due. The amounts
needed for the purposes of this subdivision are annually appropriated to the department from the
state general fund.
    (c) The Departments of Education and Finance must jointly develop detailed procedures
for school districts and intermediate school districts to notify the state that they have obligated
themselves to be bound by the provisions of this section, procedures for districts and paying
agents to notify the state of potential defaults and to request state payment under this section, and
procedures for the state to expedite payments to prevent defaults. The procedures are not subject to
chapter 14.
     Subd. 3. School district bound; interest rate on state paid amount. If, at the request of a
school district or intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest
due on a district's debt obligation on a specific date, the school district or intermediate school district
is bound by all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the
date paid until the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner
of finance. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4 and other payments received from the district.
    Subd. 4. Pledge of district's full faith and credit. If, at the request of a school district or
intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on a district's
debt obligation on a specific date, the pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers
of the school district or the member districts of the intermediate school district to repay the principal
and interest due on those debt obligations shall also, without an election or the requirement of a
further authorization, become a pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers of
the school district or the member districts of the intermediate school district to repay to the state the
amount paid, with interest. Amounts paid by the state must be repaid in the order in which the state
payments were made.
    Subd. 4a. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the state
must reduce the state aid payable to the school district or intermediate school district under this
chapter and chapters 122A, 123A, 123B, 124D, 125A, 126C, and 273 by the amount paid by the
state under this section on behalf of the district, plus the interest due on it, and the amount reduced
must revert from the appropriate account to the state general fund. Payments from the school district

endowment fund or any federal aid payments shall not be reduced.
    (b) For an intermediate school district, the state aid payable to the intermediate school district
must first be reduced, before any reduction is made to the state aids payable to the member districts.
If the state aid payable to the intermediate school district is not sufficient to repay the state, state
aid payable to member districts may be reduced proportionately based on the ratio of each member
district's adjusted net tax capacity to the total adjusted net tax capacity of all member districts.
    (c) If, after review of the financial situation of the school district or intermediate school
district, the commissioner advises the commissioner of finance that a total reduction of aids would
cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the district, the
commissioner, with the approval of the commissioner of finance, may establish a different schedule
for reduction of aids to repay the state. The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any
amounts repaid to the state by the district from other revenue sources.
    Subd. 6. Tax levy for repayment. (a) With the approval of the commissioner, a district may
levy in the year the state makes a payment under this section an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for the repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the district. The proceeds of this levy may be used only for this purpose
unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess shall be used to repay
other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the debt redemption fund of the
school district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the district for purposes of section
275.065, subdivision 6. The amount of aids to be reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by
the amount levied. This levy by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section
123B.53.
    (b) If the state is not repaid in full for a payment made under this section by November 30
of the calendar year following the year in which the state makes the payment, the commissioner
shall require the district to certify a property tax levy in an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the school district. To prevent undue hardship, the commissioner may allow
the district to certify the levy over a five-year period. The proceeds of the levy may be used only
for this purpose unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess
shall be used to repay other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the
debt redemption fund of the district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the school
district for purposes of section 275.065, subdivision 6. If the commissioner orders the district to
levy, the amount of aids reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by the amount levied. This levy
by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section 123B.53 or any successor
provision. A levy under this subdivision must be explained as a specific increase at the meeting
required under section 275.065, subdivision 6.
    (c) For an intermediate school district, a levy made by a member district under paragraph (a)
or (b) to pay its pro rata share must be spread by the commissioner as a tax rate based on the total
adjusted net tax capacity of the member school districts. The proceeds of the levy must be remitted by
the member school district to the intermediate school district and must be used by the intermediate
school district only to repay the state amounts owed. Any amount in excess of the amount owed
to the state must be repaid to the member school districts and the commissioner shall adjust each
member district's property tax levy in the next year.

    Subd. 7. Election as to mandatory application. A school district or intermediate school district
may covenant and obligate itself, prior to the issuance of an issue of debt obligations, to notify the
commissioner of a potential default and to use the provisions of this section to guarantee payment
of the principal and interest on those debt obligations when due. If the district obligates itself to
be bound by this section, it must covenant in the resolution that authorizes the issuance of the debt
obligations to deposit with the paying agent three business days prior to the date on which a payment
is due an amount sufficient to make that payment or to notify the commissioner under subdivision 1
that it will be unable to make all or a portion of that payment. A district that has obligated itself must
include a provision in its agreement with the paying agent for that issue that requires the paying agent
to inform the commissioner if it becomes aware of a potential default in the payment of principal
or interest on that issue or if, on the day two business days prior to the date a payment is due on
that issue, there are insufficient funds to make the payment on deposit with the paying agent. Funds
invested in a refunding escrow account established under section 475.67 that are to become available
to the paying agent on a principal or interest payment date are deemed to be on deposit with the
paying agent three business days before the payment date. If a district either covenants to be bound
by this section or accepts state payments under this section to prevent a default of a particular issue
of debt obligations, the provisions of this section shall be binding as to that issue as long as any debt
obligation of that issue remain outstanding. If the provisions of this section are or become binding
for more than one issue of debt obligations and a district is unable to make payments on one or more
of those issues, the district must continue to make payments on the remaining issues.
    Subd. 8. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the state makes payments on behalf of a
school district or intermediate school district under this section or the district defaults in the payment
of principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to the commissioner
for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to resolve the issues which led to its
inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The department must provide technical
assistance to the district in preparing its plan. If the commissioner determines that a district's plan
is not adequate, the commissioner shall notify the district that the plan has been disapproved, the
reasons for the disapproval, and that the state shall not make future payments under this section
for debt obligations issued after the date specified in that notice until its plan is approved. The
commissioner may also notify the district that until its plan is approved, other aids due the district
will be withheld after a date specified in the notice.
    Subd. 9. State bond rating. If the commissioner of finance determines that the credit rating of
the state would be adversely affected thereby, the commissioner of finance shall not issue warrants
under subdivision 2 for the payment of principal or interest on any debt obligations for which a
district did not, prior to their issuance, obligate itself to be bound by the provisions of this section.
    Subd. 10. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of finance may enter into
written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information needed to
facilitate the ability of school districts to issue debt obligations according to federal securities laws,
rules, and regulations, including securities and exchange commission rules and regulations, section
240.15c2-12. Such agreements or contracts may be in any form the commissioner of finance deems
reasonable and in the state's best interests.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 127A.49, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Abatements. Whenever by virtue of chapter 278, sections 270C.86, 375.192, or
otherwise, the net tax capacity or referendum market value of any district for any taxable year is
changed after the taxes for that year have been spread by the county auditor and the local tax rate
as determined by the county auditor based upon the original net tax capacity is applied upon the
changed net tax capacities, the county auditor shall, prior to February 1 of each year, certify to
the commissioner of education the amount of any resulting net revenue loss that accrued to the
district during the preceding year. Each year, the commissioner shall pay an abatement adjustment
to the district in an amount calculated according to the provisions of this subdivision. This amount
shall be deducted from the amount of the levy authorized by section 126C.46. The amount of the
abatement adjustment must be the product of:
     (1) the net revenue loss as certified by the county auditor, times
     (2) the ratio of:
    (i) the sum of the amounts of the district's certified levy in the third preceding year according to
the following:

   Sec. 3. [120B.299] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section apply to this chapter.
   Subd. 2. Growth. "Growth" compares the difference between a student's achievement score at
two distinct points in time.
   Subd. 3. Value-added. "Value-added" is the amount of achievement a student demonstrates
above an established baseline.
    Subd. 4. Growth-based value-added. "Growth-based value-added" is a value-added system of
assessments that measures the difference between an established baseline of growth and a student's
growth over time.
   Subd. 5. Adequate yearly progress. Adequate yearly progress compares the average
achievement of two different groups of students at two different points in time.
    Subd. 6. State growth norm. "State growth norm" is an established statewide percentile,
or standard applicable to all students in a particular grade benchmarked to an established
school year. Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth norm is benchmarked to
2006-2007 school year data until the commissioner next changes the vertically linked scale score.
Each time the commissioner changes the vertically linked scale score, a recognized Minnesota
assessment group composed of assessment and evaluation directors and staff and researchers under
section 120B.299, subdivision 6, in collaboration with the Independent Office of Educational
Accountability under section 120B.31, subdivision 3, must recommend a new state growth norm
that the commissioner shall consider with the revised standards. For each newly established
state growth norm, the commissioner also must establish criteria for identifying schools and
school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth in order to advance educators' professional
development and to replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

proficiency in the context of the state's grade level academic standards. If a state assessment is not
available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript.

system. The commissioner must apply the state growth norm to students in grades 4 through 8
beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, consistent with section 120B.299, subdivision 6, initially
benchmarking the state growth norm to 2007-2008 school year data. The model must allow the
user to:
      (1) report student growth at and above the state norm; and
    (2) for all student categories with a cell size of at least 20, report and compare aggregated and
disaggregated state growth data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001
No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively. The
model must have the ability to measure the effects on student growth at the school level.

reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the commissioner annually,

advanced placement, international baccalaureate, postsecondary enrollment options, other rigorous
courses of study under section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, or industry certification courses.
When reporting the core measures under clauses (1) and (2), the commissioner must also analyze

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.21, is amended to read:
  122A.21 TEACHERS' AND ADMINISTRATORS' LICENSES; FEES; LICENSURE VIA
PORTFOLIO.
    (a) Each application for the issuance, renewal, or extension of a license to teach, including
candidates for licensure via portfolio under paragraph (b), must be accompanied by a processing fee
of $57. Each application for issuing, renewing, or extending the license of a school administrator or
supervisor must be accompanied by a processing fee in the amount set by the Board of Teaching.
The processing fee for a teacher's license and for the licenses of supervisory personnel must be
paid to the executive secretary of the appropriate board. The executive secretary of the board shall
deposit the fees with the commissioner of finance. The fees as set by the board are nonrefundable
for applicants not qualifying for a license. However, a fee must be refunded by the commissioner of
finance in any case in which the applicant already holds a valid unexpired license. The board may
waive or reduce fees for applicants who apply at the same time for more than one license.
    (b) A qualified candidate may use licensure via portfolio to obtain an initial licensure or to
add a licensure field. A candidate for initial licensure must submit one portfolio demonstrating
pedagogical competence and one portfolio demonstrating content competence consistent with the
applicable Board of Teaching licensure rules. A candidate seeking to add a licensure field must
submit one portfolio demonstrating content competence consistent with the Board of Teaching
licensure rule. Candidates must submit all portfolios to the Educator Licensing Division at the
Minnesota Department of Education. A candidate must pay a $500 fee for the first portfolio
submitted for review and a $250 fee for any portfolio submitted subsequently. The fees must be
paid to the executive secretary of the Board of Teaching. The revenue generated from the fee must
be deposited in an account in the state government special revenue fund. Money in the account,
including interest earned, is appropriated to the board for the operation of licensure via portfolio.
The fees as set by the board are nonrefundable for applicants not qualifying for a license. The
board may waive or reduce fees for candidates based on financial need.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 4. Basic alternative teacher compensation aid. (a) For fiscal year 2010 and later, the
basic alternative teacher compensation aid for a school district with a plan approved under section
122A.414, subdivision 2b, equals 65 percent of the alternative teacher compensation revenue under
subdivision 1. The basic alternative teacher compensation aid for an intermediate school district or
charter school with a plan approved under section 122A.414, subdivisions 2a and 2b, if the recipient
is a charter school, equals $260 times the number of pupils enrolled in the school on October 1 of
the previous fiscal year, or on October 1 of the current fiscal year for a charter school in the first year
of operation, times the ratio of the sum of the alternative teacher compensation aid and alternative
teacher compensation levy for all participating school districts to the maximum alternative teacher
compensation revenue for those districts under subdivision 1.
   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subdivision 1, the state total basic alternative teacher
compensation aid entitlement must not exceed $46,781,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $46,538,000
96TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2008                                          8201

for fiscal year 2011 and later. The commissioner must limit the amount of alternative teacher
compensation aid approved under this section so as not to exceed these limits.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2010 and later.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
     Subd. 5. Alternative teacher compensation levy. For fiscal year 2010 and later, the alternative
teacher compensation levy for a district receiving basic alternative teacher compensation aid equals
the product of: (1) the difference between the district's alternative teacher compensation revenue,
under subdivision 1, and the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid, under subdivision
4; times (2) the lesser of one or the ratio of the district's adjusted net tax capacity per adjusted pupil
unit to $5,913.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2010 and later.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 6. Alternative teacher compensation aid. (a) For fiscal year 2010 and later, a
district's alternative teacher compensation equalization aid equals the district's alternative teacher
compensation revenue, minus the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid, minus
the district's alternative teacher compensation levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted under subdivision 5, the alternative teacher compensation equalization aid must be
reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied.
    (b) A district's alternative teacher compensation aid equals the sum of the district's basic
alternative teacher compensation aid and the district's alternative teacher compensation equalization
aid.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2010 and later.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.72, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Teacher institute functions. A teacher institute shall perform functions according to
this subdivision. The teacher institute shall assist teachers in providing advanced training during the
summer months to licensed mathematics and science teachers in the areas of content knowledge and
effective instruction practices. The teacher may be eligible for graduate-level credits upon successful
completion of the institute. The application process and criteria for admission to the teacher institute
shall be established by the commissioner of education.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for the 2008-2009 school year and later.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.09, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Authorization; notification. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an 11th
or 12th grade pupil enrolled in a school or an American Indian-controlled tribal contract or grant
school eligible for aid under section 124D.83, except a foreign exchange pupil enrolled in a district

the course syllabus in a format established by the commissioner that identifies the state standards met
by the course, content outline, assessment requirements, expectations for actual teacher contact time,
other student-to-teacher communication, and academic support for supplemental online courses
taken by students in the enrolling district. Within 15 days after the online learning provider makes
information in this paragraph available to the enrolling district, the enrolling district must either
confirm or deny to the online provider that the student, parent or guardian, and enrolling district
have agreed the courses meet the student's graduation requirements. An online learning course
or program that meets or exceeds a graduation standard or grade progression requirements at the
enrolling district as demonstrated on the online provider's syllabus must be considered to meet the
corresponding graduation requirements of the student in the enrolling district. A student may enroll
in supplemental online learning courses up to the midpoint of the enrolling district's term. The
enrolling district may waive this requirement for special circumstances and upon acceptance by
the online provider.
   (c) An online learning provider must notify the commissioner that it is delivering online learning
and report the number of online learning students it is accepting and the online learning courses and
programs it is delivering.
    (d) An online learning provider may limit enrollment if the provider's school board or board of
directors adopts by resolution specific standards for accepting and rejecting students' applications.

  (e) An enrolling district may reduce an online learning student's regular classroom instructional
membership in proportion to the student's membership in online learning courses.
    (f) The online provider must report student progress to the student, parent or guardian, and
enrolling district in a manner specified by the commissioner unless previously agreed upon by the
enrolling district and the online provider. The enrolling district must designate a contact person to
assist in the facilitation and monitoring of student progress.

The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online
learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students.
If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation
standard or grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement
is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or
courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03,
subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning student
in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online learning
provider that is not the enrolling district.
      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for payment of any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.
    (d) An enrolling district or charter school may offer online learning to its enrolled students.
Such online learning does not generate online learning funds under this section. An enrolling
district or charter school that offers online learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to

teacher with a Minnesota license must assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students.
The delivery of instruction occurs when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and
receives ongoing assistance and assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum
developed by persons other than a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants
a waiver, a teacher providing online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in
any one online learning course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply for enrollment to an approved full-time online learning program following
appropriate procedures in subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll
in classes at a local school per contract for instructional services between the online learning provider
and the school district.

section 126C.68 must not use an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the bonds.
   (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), bonds issued by a district within the first five years following
voter approval of a combination according to section 123A.37, subdivision 2, must be paid off within
20 years of issuance. All the other provisions and limitation of paragraph (d) apply.
