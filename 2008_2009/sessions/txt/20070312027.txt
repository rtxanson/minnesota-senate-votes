credit for completing the requirements of an online learning course or program. Secondary credits
granted to an online learning student must be counted toward the graduation and credit requirements
of the enrolling district. An online learning provider must make available to the enrolling district the
course syllabus, standard alignment, content outline, assessment requirements, and teacher contact
information for the courses taken by students in the enrolling district. The enrolling district must
apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online learning students, and must
continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students. If a student completes an
online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation standard or grade progression
requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement is met. The enrolling district must
use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or courses as it does for accepting credits
or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03, subdivision 9. The enrolling district may

instruction, curriculum, and assessment requirements as other courses offered to enrolled students.
The online learning provider must also demonstrate expectations for actual teacher contact time
or other student-to-teacher communication. Once an online learning provider is approved under
this paragraph, all of its online learning course offerings are eligible for payment under this section
unless a course is successfully challenged by an enrolling district or the department under paragraph
(b).
    (b) An enrolling district may challenge the validity of a course offered by an online learning
provider. The department must review such challenges based on the certification procedures under
paragraph (a). The department may initiate its own review of the validity of an online learning course
offered by an online learning provider.
    (c) The department may collect a fee not to exceed $250 for certifying online learning providers

health to be used as follows: 83 percent for contracts with a qualified community-based organization
to provide information, resources, and support to assist persons with traumatic brain injury and
their families to access services, and 17 percent to maintain the traumatic brain injury and spinal
cord injury registry created in section 144.662. For the purposes of this paragraph, a "qualified

organization without the informed voluntary written consent of the patient or patient's guardian or,
if the patient is a minor, of the parent or guardian of the patient.
    (d) The remainder of the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be known as the
remote electronic alcohol-monitoring program account. The commissioner shall transfer the balance
of this account to the commissioner of finance on a monthly basis for deposit in the general fund.
    (e) When these fees are collected by a licensing agent, appointed under section 171.061, a
handling charge is imposed in the amount specified under section 171.061, subdivision 4. The
reinstatement fees and surcharge must be deposited in an approved depository as directed under
section 171.061, subdivision 4.

other requirements of reinstatement. If a person chooses to pay 50 percent of the total, the driver's
license must expire after two years. The person must pay an additional 50 percent of the total to
extend the license for an additional two years, provided the person is otherwise still eligible for the
license. After this final payment of the surcharge and fee, the license may be renewed on a standard
schedule, as provided under section 171.27. A handling charge may be imposed for each installment
payment.
    (g) Any person making installment payments under paragraph (f), whose driver's license
subsequently expires, or is canceled, revoked, or suspended before payment of 100 percent of the
surcharge and fee, must pay the outstanding balance due for the initial reinstatement before the
driver's license is subsequently reinstated. Upon payment of the outstanding balance due for the
initial reinstatement, the person may pay any new surcharge and fee imposed under paragraph (b)
in installment payments as provided under paragraph (f).

water of the state as an infested water if the commissioner determines that:
   (1) the water contains a population of an aquatic invasive species that could spread to other
waters if use of the water and related activities are not regulated to prevent this; or

to a water that contains a population of an aquatic invasive species.
   (b) When determining which invasive species comprise infested waters, the commissioner shall
consider:

   (2) the likely means of spread for a species; and

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.045, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 12. Establishing fees. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the commissioner may, by
written order published in the State Register, establish fees providing for the use of state wildlife
management area or aquatic management area lands for specific purposes, including dog trials,
special events, and commercial uses. The fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter
14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.405, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Personal possession. (a) A person acting under a license or traveling from an area where
a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp
validation and a valid state driver's license, state identification card, or other form of identification
provided by the commissioner, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.

separately scaled and paid for. If payment is provided as specified in this paragraph as security
under paragraph (a) and no cutting has taken place on the contract, the county auditor may credit
the security provided, less any down payment required for an auction sale under this paragraph, to
any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under this chapter to which the contract

timber, including biomass, as appraised or scaled, at its discretion. Any parcels of land from which
timber is to be sold by scale of cut products shall be so designated in the published notice of sale
under paragraph (a), in which case the notice shall contain a description of the parcels, a statement
of the estimated quantity of each species of timber, and the appraised price of each species of timber
for 1,000 feet, per cord or per piece, as the case may be. In those cases any bids offered over and
above the appraised prices shall be by percentage, the percent bid to be added to the appraised price
of each of the different species of timber advertised on the land. The purchaser of timber from the
parcels shall pay in cash at the time of sale at the rate bid for all of the timber shown in the notice
of sale as estimated to be standing on the land, and in addition shall pay at the same rate for any
additional amounts which the final scale shows to have been cut or was available for cutting on the
land at the time of sale under the terms of the sale. Where the final scale of cut products shows
that less timber was cut or was available for cutting under terms of the sale than was originally
paid for, the excess payment shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of
the purchaser, to be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the
county. No timber, except hardwood pulpwood, may be removed from the parcels of land or other
designated landings until scaled by a person or persons designated by the county board and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources. Landings other than the parcel of land from which timber
is cut may be designated for scaling by the county board by written agreement with the purchaser
of the timber. The county board may, by written agreement with the purchaser and with a consumer
designated by the purchaser when the timber is sold by the county auditor, and with the approval
of the commissioner of natural resources, accept the consumer's scale of cut products delivered at
the consumer's landing. No timber shall be removed until fully paid for in cash. Small amounts of
timber not exceeding $3,000 in appraised valuation may be sold for not less than the full appraised
value at private sale to individual persons without first publishing notice of sale or calling for bids,
provided that in case of a sale involving a total appraised value of more than $200 the sale shall be
made subject to final settlement on the basis of a scale of cut products in the manner above provided
and not more than two of the sales, directly or indirectly to any individual shall be in effect at one
time.
    (d) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, and at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for use as cottage and camp sites
and for agricultural purposes and for the purpose of taking and removing of hay, stumpage, sand,
gravel, clay, rock, marl, and black dirt from the land, and for garden sites and other temporary uses
provided that no leases shall be for a period to exceed ten years; provided, further that any leases
involving a consideration of more than $12,000 per year, except to an organized subdivision of the
state shall first be offered at public sale in the manner provided herein for sale of timber. Upon
the sale of any leased land, it shall remain subject to the lease for not to exceed one year from the
beginning of the term of the lease. Any rent paid by the lessee for the portion of the term cut off by
the cancellation shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the lessee, to
be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county.
    (e) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations, or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, at the
27TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2007                                           757

prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for the purpose of taking and
removing for use for road construction and other purposes tax-forfeited stockpiled iron-bearing
material. The county auditor must determine that the material is needed and suitable for use in
the construction or maintenance of a road, tailings basin, settling basin, dike, dam, bank fill, or
other works on public or private property, and that the use would be in the best interests of the
public. No lease shall exceed ten years. The use of a stockpile for these purposes must first be
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. The request shall be deemed approved unless
the requesting county is notified to the contrary by the commissioner of natural resources within
six months after receipt of a request for approval for use of a stockpile. Once use of a stockpile has
been approved, the county may continue to lease it for these purposes until approval is withdrawn
by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (f) The county auditor, with the approval of the county board is authorized to grant permits,
licenses, and leases to tax-forfeited lands for the depositing of stripping, lean ores, tailings, or waste
products from mines or ore milling plants, upon the conditions and for the consideration and for the
period of time, not exceeding 15 years, as the county board may determine. The permits, licenses,
or leases are subject to approval by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (g) Any person who removes any timber from tax-forfeited land before said timber has been
scaled and fully paid for as provided in this subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (h) The county auditor may, with the approval of the county board, and without first offering
at public sale, grant leases, for a term not exceeding 25 years, for the removal of peat and for
the production or removal of farm-grown closed-loop biomass as defined in section 216B.2424,
subdivision 1, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands upon the terms and conditions
as the county board may prescribe. Any lease for the removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop
biomass, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands must first be reviewed and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources if the lease covers 320 or more acres. No lease for the
removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop biomass, or short-rotation woody crops shall be made by
the county auditor pursuant to this section without first holding a public hearing on the auditor's
intention to lease. One printed notice in a legal newspaper in the county at least ten days before the
hearing, and posted notice in the courthouse at least 20 days before the hearing shall be given of the
hearing.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c) to the contrary, the St. Louis County auditor
may, at the discretion of the county board, sell timber to the party who bids the highest price for all
the several kinds of timber, as provided for sales by the commissioner of natural resources under
section 90.14. Bids offered over and above the appraised price need not be applied proportionately
to the appraised price of each of the different species of timber.
    (j) In lieu of any payment or deposit required in paragraph (b), as directed by the county board
and under terms set by the county board, the county auditor may accept an irrevocable bank letter
of credit in the amount equal to the amount otherwise determined in paragraph (b). If an irrevocable
bank letter of credit is provided under this paragraph, at the written request of the purchaser, the
county may periodically allow the bank letter of credit to be reduced by an amount proportionate
to the value of timber that has been harvested and for which the county has received payment. The
remaining amount of the bank letter of credit after a reduction under this paragraph must not be less
than 20 percent of the value of the timber purchased. If an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash
deposit is provided for the down payment required in paragraph (b), and no cutting of timber has

taken place on the contract for which a letter of credit has been provided, the county may allow the
transfer of the letter of credit to any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under
this chapter to which the contract holder requests in writing that it be credited.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.191, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Apportionment formula of general application. (a) Except for those trades or
businesses required to use a different formula under subdivision 3 or section 290.36, and for those
trades or businesses that receive permission to use some other method under section 290.20 or
under subdivision 4, a trade or business required to apportion its net income must apportion its
income to this state on the basis of the percentage obtained by taking the sum of:
   (1) the percent for the sales factor under paragraph (b) of the percentage which the sales made
within this state in connection with the trade or business during the tax period are of the total sales
wherever made in connection with the trade or business during the tax period;
    (2) the percent for the property factor under paragraph (b) of the percentage which the total
tangible property used by the taxpayer in this state in connection with the trade or business during
the tax period is of the total tangible property, wherever located, used by the taxpayer in connection
with the trade or business during the tax period; and
    (3) the percent for the payroll factor under paragraph (b) of the percentage which the taxpayer's
total payrolls paid or incurred in this state or paid in respect to labor performed in this state in
connection with the trade or business during the tax period are of the taxpayer's total payrolls paid
or incurred in connection with the trade or business during the tax period.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) and subdivision 3, the following percentages apply for the
taxable years specified:

                                                              ­ as follows:
27TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2007                                          759

   (1) for sales and purchases of capital equipment by the wood products industry, the tax is not

mining, or refining.
   (d) For purposes of this subdivision:
    (1) "Equipment" means independent devices or tools separate from machinery but essential to
an integrated production process, including computers and computer software, used in operating,

is returned as undeliverable but with no forwarding address, the county auditor shall change the
registrant's status to "challenged" in the statewide registration system. An individual challenged
in accordance with this subdivision shall comply with the provisions of section 204C.12, before
being allowed to vote. If a notice mailed at least 60 days after the return of the first nonforwardable
mailing is also returned by the postal service, the county auditor shall change the registrant's status
to "inactive" in the statewide registration system.

a registration pursuant to subsection (a); and

paragraph (b) loses minor party status as of December 31 following the later of the two consecutive
state general elections.
    (e) A minor party that qualifies to be a major party loses its status as a minor party at the time
it becomes a major party. Votes received by the candidates of a major party must be counted in
determining whether the party received sufficient votes to qualify as a minor party, notwithstanding
that the party does not receive sufficient votes to retain its major party status. To be considered a
minor party in an election in a legislative district, the political party must have presented at least

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.061, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prior to election day. At any time except during the 20 days immediately
preceding any regularly scheduled election, an eligible voter or any individual who will be an
eligible voter at the time of the next election may register to vote in the precinct in which the voter
maintains residence by completing a paper voter registration application as described in section
201.071, subdivision 1, and submitting it in person or by mail to the county auditor of that county
or to the Secretary of State's Office. If the individual has a Minnesota driver's license, identification
card, or learner's permit, the individual may register online using the Web site maintained by the
secretary of state. A registration that is received no later than 5:00 p.m. on the 21st day preceding

any election shall be accepted. An improperly addressed or delivered registration application shall
be forwarded within two working days after receipt to the county auditor of the county where the
voter maintains residence. A state or local agency or an individual that accepts completed voter
registration applications from a voter must submit the completed applications to the secretary of
state or the appropriate county auditor within ten business days after the applications are dated by
the voter.
    For purposes of this section, mail registration is defined as a voter registration application
delivered to the secretary of state, county auditor, or municipal clerk by the United States Postal
Service or a commercial carrier.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.061, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Prohibited methods of compensation; penalty. (a) No individual may be
compensated for the solicitation, collection, or acceptance of voter registration applications from
voters for submission to the secretary of state, a county auditor, or other local election official in a
manner in which payment is calculated by multiplying (1) either a set or variable payment rate, by
(2) the number of voter registration applications solicited, collected, or accepted.
   (b) No individual may be deprived of compensation or have compensation automatically
reduced exclusively for failure to solicit, collect, or accept a minimum number of voter registration
applications and no individual may receive additional compensation for reaching or exceeding a
minimum number of voter registration applications.
   (c) A person who violates this subdivision is guilty of a petty misdemeanor.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.061, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Election day registration. (a) An individual who is eligible to vote may register on
election day by appearing in person at the polling place for the precinct in which the individual
maintains residence, by completing a registration application, making an oath in the form prescribed
by the secretary of state and providing proof of residence. An individual may prove residence for
purposes of registering by:
   (1) presenting a driver's license or Minnesota identification card issued pursuant to section
171.07;
   (2) presenting any document approved by the secretary of state as proper identification;
   (3) presenting one of the following:
    (i) a current valid student identification card from a postsecondary educational institution in
Minnesota, if a list of students from that institution has been prepared under section 135A.17 and
certified to the county auditor in the manner provided in rules of the secretary of state; or
   (ii) a current student fee statement that contains the student's valid address in the precinct together
with a picture identification card; or
    (4) having a voter who is registered to vote in the precinct, or who is an employee employed by
and working in a residential facility in the precinct and vouching for a resident in the facility, sign an
oath in the presence of the election judge vouching that the voter or employee personally knows that
the individual is a resident of the precinct. A voter who has been vouched for on election day may

not sign a proof of residence oath vouching for any other individual on that election day. A voter
who is registered to vote in the precinct may sign up to 15 proof-of-residence oaths on any election
day. This limitation does not apply to an employee of a residential facility described in this clause.
The secretary of state shall provide a form for election judges to use in recording the number of
individuals for whom a voter signs proof-of-residence oaths on election day. The form must include
space for the maximum number of individuals for whom a voter may sign proof-of-residence oaths.
For each proof-of-residence oath, the form must include a statement that the voter is registered
to vote in the precinct, personally knows that the individual is a resident of the precinct, and is
making the statement on oath. The form must include a space for the voter's printed name, signature,
telephone number, and address.

with return postage provided, must be preaddressed to the auditor or clerk and the voter may return
the ballot by mail or in person to the office of the auditor or clerk. The auditor or clerk may appoint
election judges to examine the return envelopes and mark them "accepted" or "rejected" during the

the ballots in the envelope must be considered spoiled ballots and the auditor or clerk shall provide
the voter with a replacement ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot. The costs of
the mailing shall be paid by the election jurisdiction in which the voter resides. Any ballot received
by 8:00 p.m. on the day of the election must be counted.

    Subd. 5. Additional review. (a) If the postelection review in one of the reviewed precincts
reveals a difference greater than one-half of one percent, or greater than two votes in a precinct
where 400 or fewer voters cast ballots, the postelection review official must, within two days,
conduct an additional review of the races indicated in subdivision 3 in at least three precincts in the
same jurisdiction where the discrepancy was discovered. If all precincts in that jurisdiction have
been reviewed, the county auditor must immediately publicly select by lot at least three additional
precincts for review. The postelection review official must complete the additional review within
two days after the precincts are selected and report the results immediately to the county auditor.
If the second review in any of the reviewed precincts also indicates a difference in the vote totals
compiled by the voting system that is greater than one-half of one percent from the result indicated
by the postelection review, or greater than two votes in a precinct where 400 or fewer voters cast
ballots, the county auditor must conduct a review of the ballots from all the remaining precincts in
the county for the races indicated in subdivision 3. This review must be completed no later than six
weeks after the state general election.
    (b) If the results from the countywide reviews from one or more counties comprising in the
aggregate more than ten percent of the total number of persons voting in the election clearly indicate
that an error in vote counting has occurred, the postelection review official must conduct a manual
recount of all the ballots in the district for the affected office. The recount must be completed and the
results reported to the appropriate canvassing board no later than ten weeks after the state general
election.

The filing officer must restrict public access to the address of any individual who has made a
contribution greater than $100 and who has filed with the filing officer a written statement signed
by the individual that withholding the individual's address from the financial report is required for
the safety of the individual or the individual's family.

committee formed to promote or defeat a ballot question who intentionally fails to file a report
required by section 211A.02 or a certification required by this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Each candidate or treasurer of a committee formed to promote or defeat a ballot question shall certify
to the filing officer that all reports required by section 211A.02 have been submitted to the filing
officer or that the candidate or committee has not received contributions or made disbursements
exceeding $750 in the calendar year. The certification shall be submitted to the filing officer no later
than seven days after the general or special election. The secretary of state shall prepare blanks for
this certification. An officer who issues a certificate of election to a candidate who has not certified
that all reports required by section 211A.02 have been filed is guilty of a misdemeanor.

manner the commissioner determines, for competitive funding to achieve technology standards
set by the commissioner. The application must identify, through a commonly used technology
audit process that determines the district's, consortium of districts', or charter school's current
technology capabilities, the disparity between the district's, consortium of districts', or charter
school's current technology infrastructure and capacity and the minimum statewide standards that
are established by the commissioner. The application must detail the specific efforts the applicant
intends to undertake to achieve the components, consistent with subdivision 1, and a proposed
budget detailing the district's, consortium of districts', or charter school's current and proposed
expenditures. The proposed budget must demonstrate that the applicant's efforts will support the
components in subdivision 1 in rank order. Expenditures for administration must not exceed five
percent of the proposed budget. The commissioner may require an applicant to provide additional
information. When reviewing applications, the commissioner must determine whether the applicant

United States and will have been 14 years a resident within the United States and attained the age
of 35 years on the next January 20.
    (c) The candidates must be listed on the presidential primary ballot in the order that the affidavits
of candidacy for the candidates were filed with the secretary of state.
    (d) In addition, the presidential primary ballot must contain a place for a voter to indicate a
preference for having delegates to the party's national convention remain uncommitted, and a blank
line printed below the other choices on the ballot so that a voter may write in the name of a person
who is not listed on the ballot.
   Subd. 2. Time for filing. The period for filing an affidavit of candidacy for the presidential
primary must begin 16 weeks before the primary and end 14 weeks before the primary.

each municipal clerk shall post a public notice stating the date of the presidential primary, the
location of each polling place in the municipality, and the hours during which the polling places
in the municipality will be open. The county auditor shall post a similar notice in the auditor's office
810                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [27TH DAY

with information for any polling places in unorganized territory in the county. The governing body
of a municipality or county may publish the notice in addition to posting it. Failure to give notice
does not invalidate the election.
    Subd. 3. Ballot preparation. At least ten weeks before the presidential primary, the secretary
of state shall supply each county auditor with examples of ballots, absentee ballot envelopes, ballot
return envelopes, election return envelopes, and summary statements for use in the presidential

delegates to attend the party's national convention. The secretary of each party's state convention
or congressional district convention shall promptly notify the secretary of state of the names of the
delegates to the national convention chosen as supporters of each presidential candidate.
    Subd. 2. Delegate votes. At the national convention, delegates chosen because of their support
for a presidential candidate must vote for that candidate on the first ballot, unless they have been

extent that it is inconsistent with the rules of the national party or state party.
   Sec. 6. [207A.16] USE OF VOTING MACHINES.
   The county auditor of each county shall provide all ballots, ballot labels, ballot cards, and other
necessary printed forms and supplies needed for electronic voting systems. The total cost of printing

of the appropriation for reimbursement of election expenses may be retained by the secretary of
state to administer the reimbursement program.

    Subd. 3. Certification of costs. The county auditor shall certify to the secretary of state the
costs incurred by the county for the presidential primary. The municipal clerk shall certify to the
secretary of state the costs incurred by the municipality for the presidential primary. If the total
amount certified by all units for temporary staff and overtime payments exceeds $480,000, the
secretary of state shall reduce those amounts so that they do not exceed $480,000. The secretary of

shall make a grant to a nonprofit organization with experience dealing with energy and community
wind issues to design and implement a rural wind energy development assistance program. The
program must be designed to maximize rural economic development and stabilize rural community
institutions, including hospitals and schools, by increasing the income of local residents and
increasing local tax revenues. The grant may be disbursed in two installments. The program must
provide assistance to rural entities seeking to develop wind energy electric generation projects and
to sell the energy from the projects. Among other strategies, the program must consider combining
rural entities and others into groups with the size and market power necessary for planning and
developing significant rural wind energy projects.
   (b) The program must provide assistance by, among other things:
   (1) providing legal, engineering, and financial services;
    (2) identifying target communities with favorable wind resources, community interest, and local
political support;
    (3) providing assistance to reserve, obtain, and assure the maintenance over time of wind
turbines;
   (4) creating market opportunities for utilities to meet their renewable energy obligations through
purchases of rural community wind;
   (5) assisting in the negotiation of fair power purchase agreements;
   (6) facilitating transmission interconnection and delivery of energy from rural and community
wind projects; and
   (7) lowering the market risk facing potential wind investors by supporting local wind
development from start to finish.
   The grantee must demonstrate an ability to sustain program functions with ongoing revenue
from sources other than state funding and shall provide a 35 percent grant match. The grant must be

functions, including selection and monitoring of the grantee, compliance review, and financial
oversight. Grant management fees shall be limited to 2.5 percent of the grant.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATION.
   (a) $1,000,000 in fiscal year 2008 and $1,000,000 in fiscal year 2009 are appropriated from the

COSTS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) "Electric utility" means a public utility as defined in section
216B.02, subdivision 4, that furnishes electric service to retail customers.
    (b) "Electric utility infrastructure costs" or "EUIC" means electric utility infrastructure projects
that:
     (1) are in service but were not included in the electric utility's rate base in its most recent general
824                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [27TH DAY

rate case; and
    (2) replace or modify existing electric utility infrastructure if the replacement or modification
is shown to conserve energy or use energy more efficiently, consistent with section 216B.241,
subdivision 1c.
    (c) "Electric utility infrastructure projects" means projects to the extent that they result in energy
savings that can be counted toward an electric utility's energy savings goal under section 216B.241,
subdivision 1c, and includes equipment, infrastructure, or programs designed to increase the energy
efficiency of the utility's transmission and distribution system.
    Subd. 2. Filing. (a) The commission may approve an electric utility's petition for a rate schedule
to recover EUIC under this section. An electric utility may petition the commission to recover a rate
of return, income taxes on the rate of return, incremental property taxes, if any, plus incremental
depreciation expense associated with EUIC.
   (b) The filing is subject to the following:
   (1) an electric utility may submit a filing under this section no more than once per year; and
   (2) an electric utility must file sufficient information to satisfy the commission regarding the
proposed EUIC or be subject to denial by the commission. The information includes, but is not
limited to:
   (i) the location, description, and costs associated with the project;
   (ii) evidence that the electric utility infrastructure project will conserve energy or use energy
more efficiently than similar utility facilities currently used by the electric utility;
   (iii) the proposed schedule for implementation;
    (iv) a description of the costs, and salvage value, if any, associated with the existing infrastructure
replaced or modified as a result of the project;
    (v) the proposed rate design and an explanation of why the proposed rate design is in the public
interest;
   (vi) the magnitude of timing of any known future electric utility projects that the utility may
seek to recover under this section;
   (vii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's base revenue as approved by the
commission in the electric utility's most recent general rate case, exclusive of fuel cost adjustments;
    (viii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's capital expenditures since its most
recent general rate case;
   (ix) the amount of time since the utility last filed a general rate case and the utility's reasons for
seeking recovery outside of a general rate case; and
   (x) documentation supporting the calculation of the EUIC.
Upon approval of the proposed projects and associated EUIC rate schedule, the utility may
implement the electric utility infrastructure projects.

   Subd. 3. Commission authority; rules. The commission may issue orders necessary to
implement and administer this section.
   Sec. 4. [216B.2401] ENERGY CONSERVATION POLICY GOAL.
    It is the energy policy of the state of Minnesota to achieve annual energy savings equal to
1.5 percent of annual retail energy sales of electricity and natural gas directly through energy
conservation improvement programs and rate design, and indirectly through energy codes and
appliance standards, programs designed to transform the market or change consumer behavior,
electric utility infrastructure projects, energy savings resulting from efficiency improvements to
the utility infrastructure and system, and other efforts to promote energy efficiency and energy
conservation.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.241, is amended to read:
   216B.241 ENERGY CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section and section 216B.16, subdivision 6b,
the terms defined in this subdivision have the meanings given them.
   (a) "Commission" means the Public Utilities Commission.
   (b) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of commerce.
    (c) "Customer facility" means all buildings, structures, equipment, and installations at a single
site.
   (d) "Department" means the Department of Commerce.
   (e) "Energy conservation" means demand-side management of energy supplies resulting in a net
reduction in energy use. Load management that reduces overall energy use is energy conservation.
    (f) "Energy efficiency" means measures or programs, including energy conservation measures
or programs, that target consumer behavior, equipment, processes, or devices designed to produce
either an absolute decrease in consumption of electric energy or natural gas or a decrease in
consumption of electric energy or natural gas on a per unit of production basis without a reduction
in the quality or level of service provided to the energy consumer.
    (g) "Energy conservation improvement" means a project that results in energy efficiency
or energy conservation. Energy conservation improvement does not include electric utility
infrastructure projects approved by the commission under section 216B.1636.
    ­
    (g­­
       ) (h) "Gross annual retail energy sales" means annual electric sales to all retail customers in a
utility's or association's Minnesota service territory or natural gas throughput to all retail customers,
including natural gas transportation customers, on a utility's distribution system in Minnesota. For
purposes of this section, gross annual retail energy sales exclude gas sales to a large energy facility
and gas and electric sales to a large electric customer facility exempted by the commissioner under
subdivision 1a, paragraph (b).
    (i) "Investments and expenses of a public utility" includes the investments and expenses incurred
by a public utility in connection with an energy conservation improvement, including but not limited
to:

    (1) the differential in interest cost between the market rate and the rate charged on a no-interest
or below-market interest loan made by a public utility to a customer for the purchase or installation
of an energy conservation improvement;
   (2) the difference between the utility's cost of purchase or installation of energy conservation
improvements and any price charged by a public utility to a customer for such improvements.

    (m) "Low income programs" means energy conservation improvement programs that directly
serve the needs of low income persons, including low income renters.
    Subd. 1a. Investment, expenditure, and contribution; public utility. (a) For purposes of
this subdivision and subdivision 2, "public utility" has the meaning given it in section 216B.02,
subdivision 4. Each public utility shall spend and invest for energy conservation improvements
under this subdivision and subdivision 2 the following amounts:
   (1) for a utility that furnishes gas service, 0.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from service
provided in the state;
    (2) for a utility that furnishes electric service, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from
service provided in the state; and
    (3) for a utility that furnishes electric service and that operates a nuclear-powered electric
generating plant within the state, two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided
in the state.
    For purposes of this paragraph (a), "gross operating revenues" do not include revenues from
large electric customer facilities exempted by the commissioner under paragraph (b).
    (b) The owner of a large electric customer facility may petition the commissioner to exempt
both electric and gas utilities serving the large energy customer facility from the investment and
expenditure requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to retail revenues attributable to the facility.
At a minimum, the petition must be supported by evidence relating to competitive or economic
pressures on the customer and a showing by the customer of reasonable efforts to identify, evaluate,
and implement cost-effective conservation improvements at the facility. If a petition is filed on or
before October 1 of any year, the order of the commissioner to exempt revenues attributable to the
facility can be effective no earlier than January 1 of the following year. The commissioner shall
not grant an exemption if the commissioner determines that granting the exemption is contrary
to the public interest. The commissioner may, after investigation, rescind any exemption granted
under this paragraph upon a determination that ­   co

under this paragraph, the owner of any large electric customer facility shall, upon request, provide
the commissioner with updated information comparable to that originally supplied in or with the
owner's original petition under this paragraph.
   (c) The commissioner may require investments or spending greater than the amounts required
under this subdivision for a public utility whose most recent advance forecast required under section
216B.2422 or 216C.17 projects a peak demand deficit of 100 megawatts or greater within five years
under midrange forecast assumptions.
     (d) A public utility or owner of a large electric customer facility may appeal a decision of the
commissioner under paragraph (b) or (c) to the commission under subdivision 2. In reviewing a
decision of the commissioner under paragraph (b) or (c), the commission shall rescind the decision
if it finds that the required investments or spending will:
      (1) not result in cost-effective energy conservation improvements; or
      (2) otherwise not be in the public interest.

From July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011, expenditures made to refurbish a district heating or
cooling system are considered to be load-management activities under paragraph (e). This paragraph
expires July 1, 2011.
   (i) The commissioner shall consider and may require a utility, association, or other entity
providing energy efficiency and conservation services under this section to undertake a program
suggested by an outside source, including a political subdivision, nonprofit corporation, or
community organization.
    Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation
improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent to
1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under paragraph
(d). The savings must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather normalized average.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy savings plan by calendar year 2010.
    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request the
commissioner to adjust its annual energy savings percentage goal based on its historical conservation
investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential study, or other
factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner may not approve
a plan that provides for an annual energy savings goal of less than one percent of gross annual
retail energy sales. A utility or association may include in its energy conservation plan measures or
programs designed to increase the efficiency of the utility system and waste heat recovery converted
into electricity that may count as energy savings if the one percent floor has been achieved by other
energy savings. Measures or programs must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that
which would have occurred through normal maintenance activity. For the purpose of this paragraph,
"waste heat recovery converted into electricity" means an energy recovery process that converts
otherwise lost energy from the heat of exhaust stacks or pipes used for engines or manufacturing or
industrial processes, or the reduction of high pressure in water or gas pipelines.

    (e) An energy savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments that are not
cost-effective even if the investment is necessary to attain the energy savings goals. For the purpose
of this paragraph, in determining cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and
benefits to ratepayers, the utility, participants, and society.
     (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available.
The commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity
filing an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner under
subdivisions 1a and 1b.
    (h) By January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall report to the legislature whether the spending
requirements under subdivisions 1a and 1b are necessary to achieve the energy savings goals
established in this subdivision.

    The commissioner shall evaluate energy conservation improvement programs on the basis of
cost-effectiveness and the reliability of the technologies employed. The commissioner shall, by
order, establish, maintain and update energy savings assumptions that must be used when filing
energy conservation improvement programs. The commissioner shall establish an inventory of
the most effective energy conservation programs, techniques, and technologies, and encourage
all Minnesota utilities to implement them, where appropriate, in their service territories. The
commissioner shall describe these programs in sufficient detail to provide a utility reasonable
guidance concerning implementation. The commissioner shall prioritize the opportunities in order
of potential energy savings and in order of cost-effectiveness and to evaluate energy conservation
improvement programs. The commissioner may contract with a third party to carry out any of
the commissioner's duties under this subdivision, and to obtain technical assistance to evaluate
the effectiveness of any conservation improvement program. The commissioner may assess up to
$800,000 annually until June 30, 2009, and $450,000 annually thereafter for the purposes of this
subdivision. The assessments must be deposited into the energy and conservation account.
    Subd. 1e. Applied research and development grants. The commissioner may, by order,

$3,600,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited into
the energy and conservation account.
   Subd. 1f. Facilities energy efficiency. (a) The Department of Administration and the
Department of Commerce shall maintain and, as needed, revise the sustainable building design
guidelines developed under section 16B.325.
    (b) The Department of Administration and the Department of Commerce shall maintain and
update the benchmarking tool developed under Laws 2001, chapter 212, article 1, section 3, so
that all public buildings can use the benchmarking tool to maintain energy use information for
the purposes of establishing energy efficiency benchmarks, tracking building performance and
measuring the results of energy efficiency and conservation improvements.
    (c) The commissioner shall require that utilities include in their conservation improvement
plans programs that facilitate professional engineering verification to qualify a building as Energy
Star-labeled or as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified. The state
goal is to achieve certification of 1,000 commercial buildings as Energy Star-certified, and 100
commercial buildings as LEED-certified by December 31, 2010.
   (d) The commissioner may assess up to $500,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision.
The assessments must be deposited into the energy and conservation account.
     Subd. 2. Programs. (a) The commissioner may require public utilities to make investments and
expenditures in energy conservation improvements, explicitly setting forth the interest rates, prices,
and terms under which the improvements must be offered to the customers. The required programs
must cover no more than a ­             fo­u

basis of cost-effectiveness and the reliability of technologies employed. The commissioner's order
must provide to the extent practicable for a free choice, by consumers participating in the program,
of the device, method, material, or project constituting the energy conservation improvement and
for a free choice of the seller, installer, or contractor of the energy conservation improvement,
provided that the device, method, material, or project seller, installer, or contractor is duly licensed,
certified, approved, or qualified, including under the residential conservation services program,
where applicable.
   (b) The commissioner may require a utility to make an energy conservation improvement
investment or expenditure whenever the commissioner finds that the improvement will result in
energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an
equivalent amount of new supply of energy. The commissioner shall nevertheless ensure that every
public utility operate one or more programs under periodic review by the department.
    (c) Each public utility subject to subdivision 1a may spend and invest annually up to ten percent
of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy conservation improvements under

conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by the public utility.
    (d) A public utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large energy facility or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (b). The commissioner shall consider and
may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including a political

    (g

suggested a program, the attorney general acting on behalf of consumers and small business
interests, or a utility customer that has suggested a program and is not represented by the attorney
general under section 8.33 may petition the commission to modify or revoke a department
decision under this section, and the commission may do so if it determines that the program is
not cost-effective, does not adequately address the residential conservation improvement needs of
low-income persons, has a long-range negative effect on one or more classes of customers, or is
otherwise not in the public interest. The commission shall reject a petition that, on its face, fails to
make a reasonable argument that a program is not in the public interest.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (f) The commissioner may order a public utility to include, with the filing of the utility's
proposed conservation improvement plan under paragraph (a), the results of an independent audit
of the utility's conservation improvement programs and expenditures performed by the department
or an auditor with experience in the provision of energy conservation and energy efficiency services
approved by the commissioner and chosen by the utility. The audit must specify the energy savings
or increased efficiency in the use of energy within the service territory of the utility that is the
result of the spending and investments. The audit must evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utility's
conservation programs.

    Subd. 2b. Recovery of expenses. The commission shall allow a utility to recover expenses
resulting from a conservation improvement program required by the department and contributions
to the energy and conservation account, unless the recovery would be inconsistent with a financial
incentive proposal approved by the commission. The commission shall allow a cooperative electric
association subject to rate regulation under section 216B.026 to recover expenses resulting from
energy conservation improvement programs, load management programs, and contributions to
the energy and conservation account unless the recovery would be inconsistent with a financial
incentive proposal approved by the commission. In addition, a utility may file annually, or the
Public Utilities Commission may require the utility to file, and the commission may approve,
rate schedules containing provisions for the automatic adjustment of charges for utility service in
direct relation to changes in the expenses of the utility for real and personal property taxes, fees,
and permits, the amounts of which the utility cannot control. A public utility is eligible to file for
adjustment for real and personal property taxes, fees, and permits under this subdivision only if,
in the year previous to the year in which it files for adjustment, it has spent or invested at least
1.75 percent of its gross revenues from provision of electric service, excluding gross operating
revenues from electric service provided in the state to large electric customer facilities for which
the commissioner has issued an exemption under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b), and 0.6 percent
of its gross revenues from provision of gas service, excluding gross operating revenues from gas
services provided in the state to large electric customer facilities for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b), for that year for energy conservation
improvements under this section.
    Subd. 2c. Performance incentives. By December 31, 2008, the commission shall review any
incentive plan for energy conservation improvement it has approved under 216B.16, subdivision
6c, and adjust the utility performance incentives to recognize making progress toward and meeting
the energy savings goals established in subdivision 1c.
    Subd. 3. Ownership of energy conservation improvement. An energy conservation
improvement made to or installed in a building in accordance with this section, except systems
owned by the utility and designed to turn off, limit, or vary the delivery of energy, are the exclusive
property of the owner of the building except to the extent that the improvement is subjected to
a security interest in favor of the utility in case of a loan to the building owner. The utility has

no liability for loss, damage or injury caused directly or indirectly by an energy conservation
improvement except for negligence by the utility in purchase, installation, or modification of the
product.
    Subd. 4. Federal law prohibitions. If investments by public utilities in energy conservation
improvements are in any manner prohibited or restricted by federal law and there is a provision under
which the prohibition or restriction may be waived, then the commission, the governor, or any other
necessary state agency or officer shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to secure a waiver
with respect to those public utility investments in energy conservation improvements included in
this section.
    Subd. 5. Efficient lighting program. (a) Each public utility, cooperative electric association,
and municipal utility that provides electric service to retail customers shall include as part of its
conservation improvement activities a program to strongly encourage the use of fluorescent and
high-intensity discharge lamps. The program must include at least a public information campaign
to encourage use of the lamps and proper management of spent lamps by all customer classifications.
    (b) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to 200,000 or more customers shall
establish, either directly or through contracts with other persons, including lamp manufacturers,
distributors, wholesalers, and retailers and local government units, a system to collect for delivery
to a reclamation or recycling facility spent fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps from
households and from small businesses as defined in section 645.445 that generate an average of
fewer than ten spent lamps per year.
    (c) A collection system must include establishing reasonably convenient locations for collecting
spent lamps from households and financial incentives sufficient to encourage spent lamp generators
to take the lamps to the collection locations. Financial incentives may include coupons for purchase
of new fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps, a cash back system, or any other financial
incentive or group of incentives designed to collect the maximum number of spent lamps from
households and small businesses that is reasonably feasible.
   (d) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to fewer than 200,000 customers,
a cooperative electric association, or a municipal utility that provides electric service at retail to
customers may establish a collection system under paragraphs (b) and (c) as part of conservation
improvement activities required under this section.
    (e) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency may not, unless clearly required by
federal law, require a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipality that establishes
a household fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamp collection system under this section to
manage the lamps as hazardous waste as long as the lamps are managed to avoid breakage and
are delivered to a recycling or reclamation facility that removes mercury and other toxic materials
contained in the lamps prior to placement of the lamps in solid waste.
   (f) If a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal utility contracts with a local
government unit to provide a collection system under this subdivision, the contract must provide for
payment to the local government unit of all the unit's incremental costs of collecting and managing
spent lamps.
    (g) All the costs incurred by a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal
utility for promotion and collection of fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps under this

subdivision are conservation improvement spending under this section.
    Subd. 6. Renewable energy research. (a) A public utility that owns a nuclear generation
facility in the state shall spend five percent of the total amount that utility is required to spend under
this section to support basic and applied research and demonstration activities at the University of
Minnesota Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment for the development of renewable
energy sources and technologies. The utility shall transfer the required amount to the University
of Minnesota on or before July 1 of each year and that annual amount shall be deducted from the
amount of money the utility is required to spend under this section. The University of Minnesota
shall transfer at least ten percent of these funds to at least one rural campus or experiment station.
   (b) Research funded under this subdivision shall include:
   (1) development of environmentally sound production, distribution, and use of energy,
chemicals, and materials from renewable sources;
    (2) processing and utilization of agricultural and forestry plant products and other bio-based,
renewable sources as a substitute for fossil-fuel-based energy, chemicals, and materials using a
variety of means including biocatalysis, biorefining, and fermentation;
    (3) conversion of state wind resources to hydrogen for energy storage and transportation to areas
of energy demand;
   (4) improvements in scalable hydrogen fuel cell technologies; and
   (5) production of hydrogen from bio-based, renewable sources; and sequestration of carbon.
    (c) Notwithstanding other law to the contrary, the utility may, but is not required to, spend more
than two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided in this state under this section
or section 216B.2411.
   (d) This subdivision expires June 30, 2008.
     Subd. 7. Low-income programs. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that each utility and
association provides low-income programs. When approving spending and energy savings goals
for low-income programs, the commissioner shall consider historic spending and participation
levels, energy savings for low-income programs, and the number of low-income persons residing in
the utility's service territory. A utility that furnishes gas service must spend at least 0.2 percent of its
gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. A utility
or association that furnishes electric service must spend at least 0.1 percent of its gross operating
revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. For a generation and
transmission cooperative association, this requirement shall apply to each association's members'
aggregate gross operating revenue from sale of electricity to residential customers in the state.
Beginning in 2010, a utility or association that furnishes electric service must spend 0.2 percent of
its gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs.
    (b) To meet the requirements of paragraph (a), a utility or association may contribute funds to
the energy and conservation account. An energy conservation improvement plan must state the
amount, if any, of low-income energy conservation improvement funds the utility or association
will contribute to the energy and conservation account. Contributions must be remitted to the
commissioner by February 1 of each year.

    (c) The commissioner shall establish low-income programs to utilize funds contributed to
the energy and conservation account under paragraph (b). In establishing low-income programs,
the commissioner shall consult political subdivisions, utilities, and nonprofit and community
organizations, especially organizations engaged in providing energy and weatherization assistance
to low-income persons. Money contributed to the energy and conservation account under paragraph
(b) must provide programs for low-income persons, including low-income renters, in the service
territory of the utility or association providing the funds. The commissioner shall record and report
expenditures and energy savings achieved as a result of low-income programs funded through the
energy and conservation account in the report required under subdivision 1c, paragraph (g). The
commissioner may contract with a political subdivision, nonprofit or community organization,
public utility, municipality, or cooperative electric association to implement low-income programs
funded through the energy and conservation account.
   (d) A utility or association may petition the commissioner to modify its required spending under
paragraph (a) if the utility or association and the commissioner have been unable to expend the
amount required under paragraph (a) for three consecutive years.
    Subd. 8. Assessment. The commission or department may assess utilities subject to this section
in proportion to their respective gross operating annual retail energy sales during the last calendar
year to carry out the purposes of subdivisions 1d, 1e, and 1f.
   Sec. 6. [216B.2412] DECOUPLING OF ENERGY SALES FROM REVENUES.
    Subdivision 1. Definition and purpose. For the purpose of this section, "decoupling" means a
regulatory tool designed to separate a utility's revenue from changes in energy sales. The purpose
of decoupling is to reduce a utility's disincentive to promote energy efficiency.
    Subd. 2. Decoupling criteria. The commission shall, by order, establish criteria and standards
for decoupling. The commission shall design the criteria and standards to mitigate the impact on
public utilities of the energy savings goals under section 216B.241 without adversely affecting utility
ratepayers. In designing the criteria, the commission shall consider energy efficiency, weather, and
cost of capital, among other factors.
    Subd. 3. Pilot programs. The commission shall allow one or more rate-regulated utilities to
participate in a pilot program to assess the merits of a rate-decoupling strategy to promote energy
efficiency and conservation. Each pilot program must utilize the criteria and standards established
in subdivision 2 and be designed to determine whether a rate-decoupling strategy achieves energy
savings. On or before a date established by the commission, the commission shall require electric
and gas utilities that intend to implement a decoupling program to file a decoupling pilot plan. A
pilot program may not exceed three years in length. Any extension beyond three years can only be
approved in a general rate case, unless that decoupling program was previously approved as part of
a general rate case. The commission shall report on the programs annually to the chairs of the house
of representatives and senate committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy.

       Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.65, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Energy efficiency contract. (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a school
district may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider to significantly
reduce energy or operating costs.
    (b) Before entering into a contract under this subdivision, the board shall comply with clauses
(1) to (5).
    (1) The board must seek proposals from multiple qualified providers by publishing notice of
the proposed guaranteed energy savings contract in the board's official newspaper and in other
publications if the board determines that additional publication is necessary to notify multiple
qualified providers.
   (2) The school board must select the qualified provider that best meets the needs of the board.
The board must provide public notice of the meeting at which it will select the qualified provider.
    (3) The contract between the board and the qualified provider must describe the methods that
will be used to calculate the costs of the contract and the operational and energy savings attributable
to the contract.
    (4) The qualified provider shall issue a report to the board giving a description of all costs
of installations, modifications, or remodeling, including costs of design, engineering, installation,
maintenance, repairs, or debt service, and giving detailed calculations of the amounts by which
energy or operating costs will be reduced and the projected payback schedule in years.
   (5) The board must provide published notice of the meeting in which it proposes to award the
contract, the names of the parties to the proposed contract, and the contract's purpose.
    (c) The board must provide a copy of any contract entered into under paragraph (a) and the report
provided under paragraph (b), clause (4), to the commissioner of commerce within 30 days of the
effective date of the contract.

   Subd. 13. Energy efficiency projects. The following definitions apply to this subdivision.
   (a) "Energy conservation measure" means a training program or facility alteration designed to
reduce energy consumption or operating costs and includes:
   (1) insulation of the building structure and systems within the building;
   (2) storm windows and doors, caulking or weatherstripping, multiglazed windows and doors,
heat absorbing or heat reflective glazed and coated window and door systems, additional glazing,
reductions in glass area, and other window and door system modifications that reduce energy
consumption;
   (3) automatic energy control systems;
   (4) heating, ventilating, or air conditioning system modifications or replacements;
    (5) replacement or modifications of lighting fixtures to increase the energy efficiency of the
lighting system without increasing the overall illumination of a facility, unless an increase in
illumination is necessary to conform to the applicable state or local building code for the lighting
system after the proposed modifications are made;
   (6) energy recovery systems;
    (7) cogeneration systems that produce steam or forms of energy such as heat, as well as
electricity, for use primarily within a building or complex of buildings;
   (8) energy conservation measures that provide long-term operating cost reductions.
     (b) "Guaranteed energy savings contract" means a contract for the evaluation and
recommendations of energy conservation measures, and for one or more energy conservation
measures. The contract must provide that all payments, except obligations on termination of the
contract before its expiration, are to be made over time, but not to exceed 15 years from the date
of final installation, and the savings are guaranteed to the extent necessary to make payments for
the systems.
   (c) "Qualified provider" means a person or business experienced in the design, implementation,
and installation of energy conservation measures. A qualified provider to whom the contract is
awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the municipality for its faithful performance.
   Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy
savings contract with a qualified provider to significantly reduce energy or operating costs.
    Before entering into a contract under this subdivision, the municipality shall provide published
notice of the meeting in which it proposes to award the contract, the names of the parties to the
proposed contract, and the contract's purpose.
    Before installation of equipment, modification, or remodeling, the qualified provider shall first
issue a report, summarizing estimates of all costs of installations, modifications, or remodeling,
including costs of design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, or debt service, and
estimates of the amounts by which energy or operating costs will be reduced.
   A guaranteed energy savings contract that includes a written guarantee that savings will meet or

exceed the cost of energy conservation measures is not subject to competitive bidding requirements
of section 471.345 or other law or city charter. The contract is not subject to section 123B.52.
     A municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider
if, after review of the report, it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation
measures recommended in the report is not likely to exceed the amount to be saved in energy and
operation costs over 15 years from the date of installation if the recommendations in the report were
followed, and the qualified provider provides a written guarantee that the energy or operating cost
savings will meet or exceed the costs of the system. The guaranteed energy savings contract may
provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed 15 years.
    A municipality may enter into an installment payment contract for the purchase and installation
of energy conservation measures. The contract must provide for payments of not less than 1/15 of
the price to be paid within two years from the date of the first operation, and the remaining costs to
be paid monthly, not to exceed a 15-year term from the date of the first operation.
    A municipality entering into a guaranteed energy savings contract shall provide a copy of the
contract and the report from the qualified provider to the commissioner of commerce within 30 days
of the effective date of the contract.
    Guaranteed energy savings contracts may extend beyond the fiscal year in which they become
effective. The municipality shall include in its annual appropriations measure for each later fiscal
year any amounts payable under guaranteed energy savings contracts during the year. Failure of a
municipality to make such an appropriation does not affect the validity of the guaranteed energy
savings contract or the municipality's obligations under the contracts.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 504B.161, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. In every lease or license of residential premises, the landlord or
licensor covenants:
     (1) that the premises and all common areas are fit for the use intended by the parties;
    (2) to keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license, except when
the disrepair has been caused by the willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct of the tenant or
licensee or a person under the direction or control of the tenant or licensee; and
    (3) to make the premises reasonably energy efficient by installing weatherstripping, caulking,
storm windows, and storm doors when any such measure will result in energy procurement cost
savings, based on current and projected average residential energy costs in Minnesota, that will
exceed the cost of implementing that measure, including interest, amortized over the ten-year period
following the incurring of the cost; and
    (4) to maintain the premises in compliance with the applicable health and safety laws of the
state, ­n

    Subd. 3. Moratorium on the development of group residential housing beds. (a) County
agencies shall not enter into agreements for new group residential housing beds with total rates
in excess of the MSA equivalent rate except: (1) for group residential housing establishments
licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0215 to 9525.0355, provided the facility is needed to
meet the census reduction targets for persons with developmental disabilities at regional treatment
centers; (2) to ensure compliance with the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act alternative
disposition plan requirements for inappropriately placed persons with developmental disabilities or
mental illness; (3) up to 80 beds in a single, specialized facility located in Hennepin County that
will provide housing for chronic inebriates who are repetitive users of detoxification centers and
are refused placement in emergency shelters because of their state of intoxication, and planning for
the specialized facility must have been initiated before July 1, 1991, in anticipation of receiving a
grant from the Housing Finance Agency under section 462A.05, subdivision 20a, paragraph (b);

of substance abuse, or human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
For purposes of this section, "homeless adult" means a person who is living on the street or in a
shelter or discharged from a regional treatment center, community hospital, or residential treatment
program and has no appropriate housing available and lacks the resources and support necessary
to access appropriate housing. At least 70 percent of the supportive housing units must serve
homeless adults with mental illness, substance abuse problems, or human immunodeficiency virus
or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who are about to be or, within the previous six months,
has been discharged from a regional treatment center, or a state-contracted psychiatric bed in a
community hospital, or a residential mental health or chemical dependency treatment program. If
a person meets the requirements of subdivision 1, paragraph (a), and receives a federal or state
housing subsidy, the group residential housing rate for that person is limited to the supplementary
rate under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, and is determined by subtracting the amount of the
person's countable income that exceeds the MSA equivalent rate from the group residential
housing supplementary rate. A resident in a demonstration project site who no longer participates
in the demonstration program shall retain eligibility for a group residential housing payment in an
amount determined under section 256I.06, subdivision 8, using the MSA equivalent rate. Service
funding under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, will end June 30, 1997, if federal matching funds
are available and the services can be provided through a managed care entity. If federal matching
funds are not available, then service funding will continue under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a;

or (6) for group residential housing beds in settings meeting the requirements of subdivision 2a,
clauses (1) and (3), which are used exclusively for recipients receiving home and community-based
waiver services under sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, subdivision 5, 256B.093, and 256B.49, and
who resided in a nursing facility for the six months immediately prior to the month of entry into
the group residential housing setting. The group residential housing rate for these beds must be
set so that the monthly group residential housing payment for an individual occupying the bed
when combined with the nonfederal share of services delivered under the waiver for that person
does not exceed the nonfederal share of the monthly medical assistance payment made for the
person to the nursing facility in which the person resided prior to entry into the group residential
housing establishment. The rate may not exceed the MSA equivalent rate plus $426.37 for any
case; or (7) for a new 65-bed facility in Crow Wing County that will serve chemically dependent
persons, operated by a group residential housing provider that currently operates a 304-bed facility
in Minneapolis, and a 44-bed facility in Duluth.
    (b) A county agency may enter into a group residential housing agreement for beds with rates in
excess of the MSA equivalent rate in addition to those currently covered under a group residential
housing agreement if the additional beds are only a replacement of beds with rates in excess of
the MSA equivalent rate which have been made available due to closure of a setting, a change of
licensure or certification which removes the beds from group residential housing payment, or as a
result of the downsizing of a group residential housing setting. The transfer of available beds from
one county to another can only occur by the agreement of both counties."

   S.F. No. 695: A bill for an act relating to human services; increasing the medical assistance asset
limit and excess income standard for aged, blind, or disabled persons; amending Minnesota Statutes
2006, section 256B.056, subdivisions 3, 5c.

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.056, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Income and assets generally. Unless specifically required by state law or rule or
federal law or regulation, the methodologies used in counting income and assets to determine
eligibility for medical assistance for persons whose eligibility category is based on blindness,
disability, or age of 65 or more years, the methodologies for the supplemental security income
program shall be used, except as provided under subdivision 3, paragraph (f). Increases in benefits
under title II of the Social Security Act shall not be counted as income for purposes of this
subdivision until July 1 of each year. Effective upon federal approval, for children eligible under
section 256B.055, subdivision 12, or for home and community-based waiver services whose
eligibility for medical assistance is determined without regard to parental income, child support
payments, including any payments made by an obligor in satisfaction of or in addition to a
temporary or permanent order for child support, and Social Security payments are not counted as
income. For families and children, which includes all other eligibility categories, the methodologies
under the state's AFDC plan in effect as of July 16, 1996, as required by the Personal Responsibility
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), Public Law 104-193, shall be used,
except that effective October 1, 2003, the earned income disregards and deductions are limited to
those in subdivision 1c. For these purposes, a "methodology" does not include an asset or income
standard, or accounting method, or method of determining effective dates."

    "(f) When a person enrolled in medical assistance under section 256B.057, subdivision 9, reaches
age 65 and has been enrolled during each of the 24 consecutive months before the person's 65th
birthday, the assets owned by the person and the person's spouse must be disregarded, up to the
limits of section 256B.057, subdivision 9, paragraph (b), when determining eligibility for medical
assistance under section 256B.055, subdivision 7. The income of a spouse of a person enrolled in
medical assistance under section 256B.057, subdivision 9, during each of the 24 consecutive months
before the person's 65th birthday must be disregarded when determining eligibility for medical
assistance under section 256B.055, subdivision 7, when the person reaches age 65. This paragraph

256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until two years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services
to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires two years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and

must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population

for home and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under the fee-for-service program. In developing program specifications
for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner shall involve and consult the state-level
stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph (d), including consultation on whether
and how to include home and community-based waiver programs. Plans for further expansion
