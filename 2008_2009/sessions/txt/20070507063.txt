                                  CHILD WELFARE POLICY
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.01, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Specific powers. Subject to the provisions of section 241.021, subdivision 2, the
commissioner of human services shall carry out the specific duties in paragraphs (a) through (cc):
    (a) Administer and supervise all forms of public assistance provided for by state law and other
welfare activities or services as are vested in the commissioner. Administration and supervision of
human services activities or services includes, but is not limited to, assuring timely and accurate
distribution of benefits, completeness of service, and quality program management. In addition
to administering and supervising human services activities vested by law in the department, the
commissioner shall have the authority to:
   (1) require county agency participation in training and technical assistance programs to promote
compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations, and policies governing human services;
   (2) monitor, on an ongoing basis, the performance of county agencies in the operation and
administration of human services, enforce compliance with statutes, rules, federal laws, regulations,
and policies governing welfare services and promote excellence of administration and program
operation;

and accuracy of benefit determinations;

    (4) require county agencies to make an adjustment to the public assistance benefits issued to any
individual consistent with federal law and regulation and state law and rule and to issue or recover
benefits as appropriate;
   (5) delay or deny payment of all or part of the state and federal share of benefits and
administrative reimbursement according to the procedures set forth in section 256.017;

and nonprofit, and individuals, using appropriated funds; and
    (7) enter into contractual agreements with federally recognized Indian tribes with a reservation
in Minnesota to the extent necessary for the tribe to operate a federally approved family assistance
program or any other program under the supervision of the commissioner. The commissioner shall
consult with the affected county or counties in the contractual agreement negotiations, if the county
or counties wish to be included, in order to avoid the duplication of county and tribal assistance
program services. The commissioner may establish necessary accounts for the purposes of receiving
and disbursing funds as necessary for the operation of the programs.
   (b) Inform county agencies, on a timely basis, of changes in statute, rule, federal law, regulation,
and policy necessary to county agency administration of the programs.
     (c) Administer and supervise all child welfare activities; promote the enforcement of laws
protecting disabled, dependent, neglected and delinquent children, and children born to mothers
who were not married to the children's fathers at the times of the conception nor at the births of the

the care of children in boarding and foster homes or in private institutions; and generally perform
all functions relating to the field of child welfare now vested in the State Board of Control.
    (d) Administer and supervise all noninstitutional service to disabled persons, including those
who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or physically impaired or otherwise disabled. The
commissioner may provide and contract for the care and treatment of qualified indigent children in
facilities other than those located and available at state hospitals when it is not feasible to provide
the service in state hospitals.
   (e) Assist and actively cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, local, state,
and federal, by performing services in conformity with the purposes of Laws 1939, chapter 431.
    (f) Act as the agent of and cooperate with the federal government in matters of mutual concern

administration of any federal funds granted to the state to aid in the performance of any functions
of the commissioner as specified in Laws 1939, chapter 431, and including the promulgation of
rules making uniformly available medical care benefits to all recipients of public assistance, at such
times as the federal government increases its participation in assistance expenditures for medical
care to recipients of public assistance, the cost thereof to be borne in the same proportion as are
grants of aid to said recipients.
   (g) Establish and maintain any administrative units reasonably necessary for the performance of
administrative functions common to all divisions of the department.
   (h) Act as designated guardian of both the estate and the person of all the wards of the state
of Minnesota, whether by operation of law or by an order of court, without any further act or

proceeding whatever, except as to persons committed as developmentally disabled. For children
under the guardianship of the commissioner or a tribe in Minnesota recognized by the Secretary
of the Interior whose interests would be best served by adoptive placement, the commissioner
may contract with a licensed child-placing agency or a Minnesota tribal social services agency
to provide adoption services. A contract with a licensed child-placing agency must be designed
to supplement existing county efforts and may not replace existing county programs or tribal
social services, unless the replacement is agreed to by the county board and the appropriate
exclusive bargaining representative, tribal governing body, or the commissioner has evidence that
child placements of the county continue to be substantially below that of other counties. Funds
encumbered and obligated under an agreement for a specific child shall remain available until the
terms of the agreement are fulfilled or the agreement is terminated.
   (i) Act as coordinating referral and informational center on requests for service for newly arrived
immigrants coming to Minnesota.
   (j) The specific enumeration of powers and duties as hereinabove set forth shall in no way be
construed to be a limitation upon the general transfer of powers herein contained.
   (k) Establish county, regional, or statewide schedules of maximum fees and charges which may
be paid by county agencies for medical, dental, surgical, hospital, nursing and nursing home care
and medicine and medical supplies under all programs of medical care provided by the state and for
congregate living care under the income maintenance programs.
    (l) Have the authority to conduct and administer experimental projects to test methods and
procedures of administering assistance and services to recipients or potential recipients of public
welfare. To carry out such experimental projects, it is further provided that the commissioner
of human services is authorized to waive the enforcement of existing specific statutory program
requirements, rules, and standards in one or more counties. The order establishing the waiver
shall provide alternative methods and procedures of administration, shall not be in conflict with
the basic purposes, coverage, or benefits provided by law, and in no event shall the duration of a
project exceed four years. It is further provided that no order establishing an experimental project
as authorized by the provisions of this section shall become effective until the following conditions
have been met:
   (1) the secretary of health and human services of the United States has agreed, for the same
project, to waive state plan requirements relative to statewide uniformity; and
  (2) a comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs, shall be approved by the Legislative
Advisory Commission and filed with the commissioner of administration.
   (m) According to federal requirements, establish procedures to be followed by local welfare
boards in creating citizen advisory committees, including procedures for selection of committee
members.
    (n) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions which are based on quality control error
rates for the aid to families with dependent children program formerly codified in sections 256.72
to 256.87, medical assistance, or food stamp program in the following manner:
    (1) one-half of the total amount of the disallowance shall be borne by the county boards
responsible for administering the programs. For the medical assistance and the AFDC program
3282                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

formerly codified in sections 256.72 to 256.87, disallowances shall be shared by each county
board in the same proportion as that county's expenditures for the sanctioned program are to the
total of all counties' expenditures for the AFDC program formerly codified in sections 256.72 to
256.87, and medical assistance programs. For the food stamp program, sanctions shall be shared
by each county board, with 50 percent of the sanction being distributed to each county in the same
proportion as that county's administrative costs for food stamps are to the total of all food stamp
administrative costs for all counties, and 50 percent of the sanctions being distributed to each
county in the same proportion as that county's value of food stamp benefits issued are to the total
of all benefits issued for all counties. Each county shall pay its share of the disallowance to the
state of Minnesota. When a county fails to pay the amount due hereunder, the commissioner may
deduct the amount from reimbursement otherwise due the county, or the attorney general, upon the
request of the commissioner, may institute civil action to recover the amount due; and
    (2) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (1), if the disallowance results from knowing
noncompliance by one or more counties with a specific program instruction, and that knowing
noncompliance is a matter of official county board record, the commissioner may require payment
or recover from the county or counties, in the manner prescribed in clause (1), an amount equal to
the portion of the total disallowance which resulted from the noncompliance, and may distribute
the balance of the disallowance according to clause (1).
    (o) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the
recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may
enter into contracts with third parties. Any recoveries that result from projects or contracts entered
into under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account
until the balance in the account reaches $1,000,000. When the balance in the account exceeds
$1,000,000, the excess shall be transferred and credited to the general fund. All money in the
account is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this paragraph.
     (p) Have the authority to make direct payments to facilities providing shelter to women and their
children according to section 256D.05, subdivision 3. Upon the written request of a shelter facility
that has been denied payments under section 256D.05, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall review
all relevant evidence and make a determination within 30 days of the request for review regarding
issuance of direct payments to the shelter facility. Failure to act within 30 days shall be considered
a determination not to issue direct payments.
   (q) Have the authority to establish and enforce the following county reporting requirements:
    (1) the commissioner shall establish fiscal and statistical reporting requirements necessary to
account for the expenditure of funds allocated to counties for human services programs. When
establishing financial and statistical reporting requirements, the commissioner shall evaluate all
reports, in consultation with the counties, to determine if the reports can be simplified or the number
of reports can be reduced;
    (2) the county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required
by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the
month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless
the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid
jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports
that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner;
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3283

   (3) if the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (2), the
commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next
reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late
report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county
boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal
funding is received;
    (4) a county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required
format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county
board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason
the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective
action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan
must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received
notice of noncompliance;
    (5) the final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date
the report was originally due. If the commissioner does not receive a report by the final deadline, the
county board forfeits the funding associated with the report for that reporting period and the county
board must repay any funds associated with the report received for that reporting period;
     (6) the commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under
clause (3) or (5) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate
forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements.
If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5), the
county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69; and
   (7) counties subject to withholding of funds under clause (3) or forfeiture or repayment of funds
under clause (5) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred
due to actions taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5).
    (r) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions when federal fiscal
disallowances or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample for the foster care program
under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, in direct proportion to each
county's title IV-E foster care maintenance claim for that period.
    (s) Be responsible for ensuring the detection, prevention, investigation, and resolution of
fraudulent activities or behavior by applicants, recipients, and other participants in the human
services programs administered by the department.
   (t) Require county agencies to identify overpayments, establish claims, and utilize all available
and cost-beneficial methodologies to collect and recover these overpayments in the human services
programs administered by the department.
    (u) Have the authority to administer a drug rebate program for drugs purchased pursuant to the
prescription drug program established under section 256.955 after the beneficiary's satisfaction
of any deductible established in the program. The commissioner shall require a rebate agreement
from all manufacturers of covered drugs as defined in section 256B.0625, subdivision 13. Rebate
agreements for prescription drugs delivered on or after July 1, 2002, must include rebates for
individuals covered under the prescription drug program who are under 65 years of age. For each
drug, the amount of the rebate shall be equal to the rebate as defined for purposes of the federal

conditions used for the federal rebate program established pursuant to section 1927 of title XIX
of the Social Security Act.

the medical assistance program as allowed by section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act and

have been dispensed or administered in an outpatient setting and that are from manufacturers who
have signed a rebate agreement with the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
    (w) Have the authority to administer a supplemental drug rebate program for drugs purchased
under the medical assistance program. The commissioner may enter into supplemental rebate
contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and may require prior authorization for drugs that
are from manufacturers that have not signed a supplemental rebate contract. Prior authorization of
drugs shall be subject to the provisions of section 256B.0625, subdivision 13.
    (x) Operate the department's communication systems account established in Laws 1993, First
Special Session chapter 1, article 1, section 2, subdivision 2, to manage shared communication
costs necessary for the operation of the programs the commissioner supervises. A communications
account may also be established for each regional treatment center which operates communications
systems. Each account must be used to manage shared communication costs necessary for the
operations of the programs the commissioner supervises. The commissioner may distribute the
costs of operating and maintaining communication systems to participants in a manner that
reflects actual usage. Costs may include acquisition, licensing, insurance, maintenance, repair,
staff time and other costs as determined by the commissioner. Nonprofit organizations and state,
county, and local government agencies involved in the operation of programs the commissioner
supervises may participate in the use of the department's communications technology and share
in the cost of operation. The commissioner may accept on behalf of the state any gift, bequest,
devise or personal property of any kind, or money tendered to the state for any lawful purpose
pertaining to the communication activities of the department. Any money received for this purpose
must be deposited in the department's communication systems accounts. Money collected by the

reimbursement agreements shall be made for each child and separate records shall be kept on each
child for whom a reimbursement agreement is made. The commissioner of human services shall
agree that the reimbursement costs are reasonable and appropriate. The commissioner may spend
up to $16,000 for each purchase of service agreement. Only one agreement per child is allowed,
unless an exception is granted by the commissioner. Funds encumbered and obligated under such
an agreement for the child remain available until the terms of the agreement are fulfilled or the
agreement is terminated.

social services agency makes reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent plan for the
child as provided in paragraph (e). In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a
child and in making those reasonable efforts, the child's best interests, health, and safety must be of
paramount concern. Reasonable efforts to prevent placement and for rehabilitation and reunification
are always required except upon a determination by the court that a petition has been filed stating a
prima facie case that:
       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been terminated involuntarily;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
    (4) the parent's custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (e), clause (1), or a similar law of another
jurisdiction; or
    (5) the provision of services or further services for the purpose of reunification is futile and
therefore unreasonable under the circumstances.
   (b) When the court makes one of the prima facie determinations under paragraph (a), either
permanency pleadings under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, or a termination of parental rights

petition under sections 260C.141 and 260C.301 must be filed. A permanency hearing under section
260C.201, subdivision 11, must be held within 30 days of this determination.
    (c) In the case of an Indian child, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178,
260C.201, and 260C.301 the juvenile court must make findings and conclusions consistent with
the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code, title 25, section 1901 et seq., as to the
provision of active efforts. In cases governed by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United
States Code, title 25, section 1901, the responsible social services agency must provide active
efforts as required under United States Code, title 25, section 1911(d).
     (d) "Reasonable efforts to prevent placement" means:
     (1) the agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent the placement of the child in foster care;
or
    (2) given the particular circumstances of the child and family at the time of the child's removal,
there are no services or efforts available which could allow the child to safely remain in the home.
    (e) "Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanent plan for the child" means due diligence by the
responsible social services agency to:
     (1) reunify the child with the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed;
    (2) assess a noncustodial parent's ability to provide day-to-day care for the child and, where
appropriate, provide services necessary to enable the noncustodial parent to safely provide the care,
as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 4;
     (3) conduct a relative search as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 5; and
    (4) when the child cannot return to the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed,
to plan for and finalize a safe and legally permanent alternative home for the child, and considers
permanent alternative homes for the child inside or outside of the state, preferably through adoption
or transfer of permanent legal and physical custody of the child.
    (f) Reasonable efforts are made upon the exercise of due diligence by the responsible social
services agency to use culturally appropriate and available services to meet the needs of the child and
the child's family. Services may include those provided by the responsible social services agency and
other culturally appropriate services available in the community. At each stage of the proceedings
where the court is required to review the appropriateness of the responsible social services agency's
reasonable efforts as described in paragraphs (a), (d), and (e), the social services agency has the
burden of demonstrating that:
     (1) it has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement of the child in foster care;
   (2) it has made reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's
home and to reunify the child with the child's family at the earliest possible time;
   (3) it has made reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent home for the child, and
considers permanent alternative homes for the child inside or outside of the state; or
    (4) reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to reunify the child with the parent or guardian
are not required. The agency may meet this burden by stating facts in a sworn petition filed under
3290                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

section 260C.141, by filing an affidavit summarizing the agency's reasonable efforts or facts the
agency believes demonstrate there is no need for reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and child,
or through testimony or a certified report required under juvenile court rules.
    (g) Once the court determines that reasonable efforts for reunification are not required because
the court has made one of the prima facie determinations under paragraph (a), the court may only
require reasonable efforts for reunification after a hearing according to section 260C.163, where the
court finds there is not clear and convincing evidence of the facts upon which the court based its
prima facie determination. In this case when there is clear and convincing evidence that the child
is in need of protection or services, the court may find the child in need of protection or services
and order any of the dispositions available under section 260C.201, subdivision 1. Reunification of
a surviving child with a parent is not required if the parent has been convicted of:
   (1) a violation of, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violation of, sections 609.185 to
609.20; 609.222, subdivision 2; or 609.223 in regard to another child of the parent;
   (2) a violation of section 609.222, subdivision 2; or 609.223, in regard to the surviving child; or
    (3) a violation of, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violation of, United States Code, title
18, section 1111(a) or 1112(a), in regard to another child of the parent.
    (h) The juvenile court, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178, 260C.201, and
260C.301 shall make findings and conclusions as to the provision of reasonable efforts. When
determining whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall consider whether services
to the child and family were:
   (1) relevant to the safety and protection of the child;
   (2) adequate to meet the needs of the child and family;
   (3) culturally appropriate;
   (4) available and accessible;
   (5) consistent and timely; and
   (6) realistic under the circumstances.
    In the alternative, the court may determine that provision of services or further services for
the purpose of rehabilitation is futile and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances or that
reasonable efforts are not required as provided in paragraph (a).
    (i) This section does not prevent out-of-home placement for treatment of a child with a
mental disability when the child's diagnostic assessment or individual treatment plan indicates
that appropriate and necessary treatment cannot be effectively provided outside of a residential or
inpatient treatment program.
    (j) If continuation of reasonable efforts to prevent placement or reunify the child with the parent
or guardian from whom the child was removed is determined by the court to be inconsistent with
the permanent plan for the child or upon the court making one of the prima facie determinations
under paragraph (a), reasonable efforts must be made to place the child in a timely manner in a safe
and permanent home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to legally finalize the permanent

placement of the child.
    (k) Reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or in another permanent placement may
be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to prevent placement or to reunify the child with the
parent or guardian from whom the child was removed. When the responsible social services agency
decides to concurrently make reasonable efforts for both reunification and permanent placement
away from the parent under paragraph (a), the agency shall disclose its decision and both plans for
concurrent reasonable efforts to all parties and the court. When the agency discloses its decision to
proceed on both plans for reunification and permanent placement away from the parent, the court's
review of the agency's reasonable efforts shall include the agency's efforts under both plans.

    Subd. 2. Court determination of tribal affiliation of child. In any child placement proceeding,
the court shall establish whether an Indian child is involved and the identity of the Indian child's
tribe. This chapter and the federal Indian Child Welfare Act are applicable without exception in

any child custody proceeding, as defined in the federal act, involving an Indian child. This chapter
applies to child custody proceedings involving an Indian child whether the child is in the physical
or legal custody of an Indian parent, Indian custodian, Indian extended family member, or other
person at the commencement of the proceedings. A court shall not determine the applicability of this
chapter or the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to a child custody proceeding based upon whether
an Indian child is part of an existing Indian family or based upon the level of contact a child has
with the child's Indian tribe, reservation, society, or off-reservation community.
   Sec. 14. [260.852] PLACEMENT PROCEDURES.
    Subdivision 1. Home study. The state must have procedures for the orderly and timely interstate
placement of children that are implemented in accordance with an interstate compact and that, within
60 days after the state receives from another state a request to conduct a study of a home environment
for purposes of assessing the safety and suitability of placing a child in the home, the state shall,
directly or by contract, conduct and complete a home study and return to the other state a report on
the results of the study, which shall address the extent to which placement in the home would meet
the needs of the child; except in the case of a home study begun before October 1, 2008, if the state
fails to comply with conducting and completing the home study within the 60-day period and this
is as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the state, the state has 75 days to comply if the
state documents the circumstances involved and certifies that completing the home study is in the
best interests of the child.
   This subdivision does not require the completion within the applicable period of the parts of the
home study involving the education and training of the prospective foster or adoptive parents.
    Subd. 2. Effect of received report. The state shall treat any report described in subdivision 1
that is received from another state, an Indian tribe, or a private agency under contract with another
state or Indian tribe as meeting any requirements imposed by the state for the completion of a home
study before placing a child in the home, unless, within 14 days after receipt of the report, the state
determines, based on grounds that are specific to the content of the report, that making a decision in
reliance on the report would be contrary to the welfare of the child.
    Subd. 3. Resources. The state shall make effective use of cross-jurisdictional resources,
including through contract for the purchase of services, and shall eliminate legal barriers to
facilitate timely adoptive or permanent placements for waiting children. The state shall not impose
any restriction on the use of private agencies for the purpose of conducting a home study to meet
the 60-day requirement.
   Subd. 4. Incentive eligibility. Minnesota is an incentive-eligible state and must:
   (1) have an approved plan as required by the United States Secretary of Health and Human
Services;
  (2) be in compliance with the data requirements of the United States Department of Health and
Human Services; and
   (3) have data that verify that a home study is completed within 30 days.
   Subd. 5. Data requirements. The state shall provide to the United States Secretary of Health
and Human Services a written report, covering the preceding fiscal year, that specifies:
63RD DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3293

    (1) the total number of interstate home studies requested by the state with respect to children in
foster care under the responsibility of the state, and with respect to each study, the identity of the
other state involved;
    (2) the total number of timely interstate home studies completed by the state with respect to
children in foster care under the responsibility of other states and, with respect to each study, the
identity of the other state involved; and
    (3) other information the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services requires in order
to determine whether Minnesota is a home study incentive-eligible state.
   Subd. 6. Definitions. (a) The definitions in this subdivision apply to this section.
    (b) "Home study" means an evaluation of a home environment conducted in accordance with
applicable requirements of the state in which the home is located, to determine whether a proposed
placement of a child would meet the individual needs of the child, including the child's safety;
permanency; health; well-being; and mental, emotional, and physical development.
    (c) "Interstate home study" means a home study conducted by a state at the request of another
state to facilitate an adoptive or foster placement in the state of a child in foster care under the
responsibility of the state.
    (d) "Timely interstate home study" means an interstate home study completed by a state if the
state provides to the state that requested the study, within 30 days after receipt of the request, a
report on the results of the study, except that there is no requirement for completion within the
30-day period of the parts of the home study involving the education and training of the prospective
foster or adoptive parents.
    Subd. 7. Background study requirements for adoption and foster care. (a) Background
study requirements for an adoption home study must be completed consistent with section 259.41,
subdivisions 1, 2, and 3.
    (b) Background study requirements for a foster care license must be completed consistent with
section 245C.08.
    Subd. 8. Home visits. If a child has been placed in foster care outside the state in which the
home of the parents of the child is located, periodically, but at least every six months, a caseworker
on the staff of the agency of the state in which the home of the parents of the child is located or the
state in which the child has been placed, or a private agency under contract with either state, must
visit the child in the home or institution and submit a report on each visit to the agency of the state
in which the home of the parents of the child is located.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
   The court shall ­

be delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse the
court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall h
                    ­­av
                       ­­e order a children's mental health screening conducted when a child is found
to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a screening instrument approved by the
commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by a mental health practitioner as defined
in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is trained in the use of the screening
instrument. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency, in
consultation with the child's family, shall have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a
functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons
adjudicated to be delinquent, in order that the condition of the minor be given due consideration
in the disposition of the case. Any funds received under the provisions of this subdivision shall not
cancel until the end of the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which the funds were
received. The funds are available for use by the commissioner of corrections during that period and
are hereby appropriated annually to the commissioner of corrections as reimbursement of the costs
of providing these services to the juvenile courts.

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.163, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260C.425, hearings on
any matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner. In all adjudicatory
proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services, the court shall admit
only evidence that would be admissible in a civil trial. To be proved at trial, allegations of a petition
alleging a child to be in need of protection or services must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.
     (b) Except for proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and
petitions for the termination of parental rights, hearings may be continued or adjourned from time
to time. In proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and petitions

for the termination of parental rights, hearings may not be continued or adjourned for more than
one week unless the court makes specific findings that the continuance or adjournment is in the best
interests of the child. If a hearing is held on a petition involving physical or sexual abuse of a child
who is alleged to be in need of protection or services or neglected and in foster care, the court shall
file the decision with the court administrator as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after the
matter is submitted to the court. When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding,
the court may make any interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance
with the provisions of sections 260C.001 to 260C.421.
   (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the court shall exclude the general public
from hearings under this chapter and shall admit only those persons who, in the discretion of the
court, have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court.
   (d) Adoption hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws relating to
adoptions.
    (e) In any permanency hearing, including the transition of a child from foster care to independent
living, the court shall ensure that any consult with the child is in an age-appropriate manner.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.201, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Review of court-ordered placements; permanent placement determination. (a)
This subdivision and subdivision 11a do not apply in cases where the child is in placement due solely
to the child's developmental disability or emotional disturbance, where legal custody has not been
transferred to the responsible social services agency, and where the court finds compelling reasons
under section 260C.007, subdivision 8, to continue the child in foster care past the time periods
specified in this subdivision. Foster care placements of children due solely to their disability are
governed by section 260C.141, subdivision 2a. In all other cases where the child is in foster care
or in the care of a noncustodial parent under subdivision 1, the court shall commence proceedings
to determine the permanent status of a child not later than 12 months after the child is placed in
foster care or in the care of a noncustodial parent. At the admit-deny hearing commencing such
proceedings, the court shall determine whether there is a prima facie basis for finding that the agency
made reasonable efforts, or in the case of an Indian child active efforts, required under section
260.012 and proceed according to the rules of juvenile court.
    For purposes of this subdivision, the date of the child's placement in foster care is the earlier of
the first court-ordered placement or 60 days after the date on which the child has been voluntarily
placed in foster care by the child's parent or guardian. For purposes of this subdivision, time spent
by a child under the protective supervision of the responsible social services agency in the home of
a noncustodial parent pursuant to an order under subdivision 1 counts towards the requirement of
a permanency hearing under this subdivision or subdivision 11a. Time spent on a trial home visit

and a permanency review for a child under eight years of age under subdivision 11a.
   For purposes of this subdivision, 12 months is calculated as follows:
     (1) during the pendency of a petition alleging that a child is in need of protection or services,
all time periods when a child is placed in foster care or in the home of a noncustodial parent are
cumulated;
3296                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

    (2) if a child has been placed in foster care within the previous five years under one or more
previous petitions, the lengths of all prior time periods when the child was placed in foster care
within the previous five years are cumulated. If a child under this clause has been in foster care for
12 months or more, the court, if it is in the best interests of the child and for compelling reasons,
may extend the total time the child may continue out of the home under the current petition up to
an additional six months before making a permanency determination.
    (b) Unless the responsible social services agency recommends return of the child to the custodial
parent or parents, not later than 30 days prior to the admit-deny hearing required under paragraph
(a) and the rules of juvenile court, the responsible social services agency shall file pleadings in
juvenile court to establish the basis for the juvenile court to order permanent placement of the child,
including a termination of parental rights petition, according to paragraph (d). Notice of the hearing
and copies of the pleadings must be provided pursuant to section 260C.152.
   (c) The permanency proceedings shall be conducted in a timely fashion including that any trial
required under section 260C.163 shall be commenced within 60 days of the admit-deny hearing
required under paragraph (a). At the conclusion of the permanency proceedings, the court shall:
   (1) order the child returned to the care of the parent or guardian from whom the child was
removed; or
    (2) order a permanent placement or termination of parental rights if permanent placement or
termination of parental rights is in the child's best interests. The "best interests of the child" means all
relevant factors to be considered and evaluated. Transfer of permanent legal and physical custody,
termination of parental rights, or guardianship and legal custody to the commissioner through a
consent to adopt are preferred permanency options for a child who cannot return home.
   (d) If the child is not returned to the home, the court must order one of the following dispositions:
    (1) permanent legal and physical custody to a relative in the best interests of the child according
to the following conditions:
    (i) an order for transfer of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative shall only be made
after the court has reviewed the suitability of the prospective legal and physical custodian;
    (ii) in transferring permanent legal and physical custody to a relative, the juvenile court shall
follow the standards applicable under this chapter and chapter 260, and the procedures set out in the
juvenile court rules;
    (iii) an order establishing permanent legal and physical custody under this subdivision must be
filed with the family court;
    (iv) a transfer of legal and physical custody includes responsibility for the protection, education,
care, and control of the child and decision making on behalf of the child;
    (v) the social services agency may bring a petition or motion naming a fit and willing relative
as a proposed permanent legal and physical custodian. The commissioner of human services shall
annually prepare for counties information that must be given to proposed custodians about their legal
rights and obligations as custodians together with information on financial and medical benefits for
which the child is eligible; and
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                          3297

    (vi) the juvenile court may maintain jurisdiction over the responsible social services agency,
the parents or guardian of the child, the child, and the permanent legal and physical custodian for
purposes of ensuring appropriate services are delivered to the child and permanent legal custodian
or for the purpose of ensuring conditions ordered by the court related to the care and custody of the
child are met;
   (2) termination of parental rights when the requirements of sections 260C.301 to 260C.328 are
met or according to the following conditions:
   (i) order the social services agency to file a petition for termination of parental rights in which
case all the requirements of sections 260C.301 to 260C.328 remain applicable; and
   (ii) an adoption completed subsequent to a determination under this subdivision may include an
agreement for communication or contact under section 259.58;
   (3) long-term foster care according to the following conditions:
    (i) the court may order a child into long-term foster care only if it approves the responsible social
service agency's compelling reasons that neither an award of permanent legal and physical custody
to a relative, nor termination of parental rights is in the child's best interests;
    (ii) further, the court may only order long-term foster care for the child under this section if it
finds the following:
    (A) the child has reached age 12 and the responsible social services agency has made reasonable
efforts to locate and place the child with an adoptive family or with a fit and willing relative who
will agree to a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody of the child, but such efforts have
not proven successful; or
   (B) the child is a sibling of a child described in subitem (A) and the siblings have a significant
positive relationship and are ordered into the same long-term foster care home; and
    (iii) at least annually, the responsible social services agency reconsiders its provision of services
to the child and the child's placement in long-term foster care to ensure that:
    (A) long-term foster care continues to be the most appropriate legal arrangement for meeting the
child's need for permanency and stability, including whether there is another permanent placement
option under this chapter that would better serve the child's needs and best interests;
   (B) whenever possible, there is an identified long-term foster care family that is committed to
being the foster family for the child as long as the child is a minor or under the jurisdiction of the
court;
    (C) the child is receiving appropriate services or assistance to maintain or build connections with
the child's family and community;
   (D) the child's physical and mental health needs are being appropriately provided for; and
   (E) the child's educational needs are being met;
   (4) foster care for a specified period of time according to the following conditions:
   (i) foster care for a specified period of time may be ordered only if:
3298                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

    (A) the sole basis for an adjudication that the child is in need of protection or services is the
child's behavior;
    (B) the court finds that foster care for a specified period of time is in the best interests of the
child; and
    (C) the court approves the responsible social services agency's compelling reasons that neither
an award of permanent legal and physical custody to a relative, nor termination of parental rights is
in the child's best interests;
   (ii) the order does not specify that the child continue in foster care for any period exceeding one
year; or
   (5) guardianship and legal custody to the commissioner of human services under the following
procedures and conditions:
    (i) there is an identified prospective adoptive home agreed to by the responsible social services
agency having legal custody of the child pursuant to court order under this section that has agreed to
adopt the child and the court accepts the parent's voluntary consent to adopt under section 259.24,
except that such consent executed by a parent under this item, following proper notice that consent
given under this provision is irrevocable upon acceptance by the court, shall be irrevocable unless
fraud is established and an order issues permitting revocation as stated in item (vii);
   (ii) if the court accepts a consent to adopt in lieu of ordering one of the other enumerated
permanency dispositions, the court must review the matter at least every 90 days. The review will
address the reasonable efforts of the agency to achieve a finalized adoption;
   (iii) a consent to adopt under this clause vests all legal authority regarding the child, including
guardianship and legal custody of the child, with the commissioner of human services as if the child
were a state ward after termination of parental rights;
   (iv) the court must forward a copy of the consent to adopt, together with a certified copy of the
order transferring guardianship and legal custody to the commissioner, to the commissioner;
    (v) if an adoption is not finalized by the identified prospective adoptive parent within 12 months
of the execution of the consent to adopt under this clause, the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner's delegate shall pursue adoptive placement in another home unless the commissioner
certifies that the failure to finalize is not due to either an action or a failure to act by the prospective
adoptive parent;
    (vi) notwithstanding item (v), the commissioner of human services or the commissioner's
designee must pursue adoptive placement in another home as soon as the commissioner or
commissioner's designee determines that finalization of the adoption with the identified prospective
adoptive parent is not possible, that the identified prospective adoptive parent is not willing to
adopt the child, that the identified prospective adoptive parent is not cooperative in completing
the steps necessary to finalize the adoption, or upon the commissioner's determination to withhold
consent to the adoption.
    (vii) unless otherwise required by the Indian Child Welfare Act, United States Code, title 25,
section 1913, a consent to adopt executed under this section, following proper notice that consent
given under this provision is irrevocable upon acceptance by the court, shall be irrevocable upon
63RD DAY]                              MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                            3299

acceptance by the court except upon order permitting revocation issued by the same court after
written findings that consent was obtained by fraud.
    (e) In ordering a permanent placement of a child, the court must be governed by the best interests
of the child, including a review of the relationship between the child and relatives and the child and
other important persons with whom the child has resided or had significant contact. When the court
has determined that permanent placement of the child away from the parent is necessary, the court
shall consider permanent alternative homes that are available both inside and outside the state.
   (f) Once a permanent placement determination has been made and permanent placement has
been established, further court reviews are necessary if:
   (1) the placement is long-term foster care or foster care for a specified period of time;
    (2) the court orders further hearings because it has retained jurisdiction of a transfer of permanent
legal and physical custody matter;
   (3) an adoption has not yet been finalized; or
   (4) there is a disruption of the permanent or long-term placement.
    (g) Court reviews of an order for long-term foster care, whether under this section or section
260C.317, subdivision 3, paragraph (d), must be conducted at least yearly and must review the child's
out-of-home placement plan and the reasonable efforts of the agency to finalize the permanent plan
for the child including the agency's efforts to:
   (1) ensure that long-term foster care continues to be the most appropriate legal arrangement for
meeting the child's need for permanency and stability or, if not, to identify and attempt to finalize
another permanent placement option under this chapter that would better serve the child's needs and
best interests;
   (2) identify a specific long-term foster home for the child, if one has not already been identified;
   (3) support continued placement of the child in the identified home, if one has been identified;
    (4) ensure appropriate services are provided to address the physical health, mental health, and
educational needs of the child during the period of long-term foster care and also ensure appropriate
services or assistance to maintain relationships with appropriate family members and the child's
community; and
   (5) plan for the child's independence upon the child's leaving long-term foster care living as
required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1.
    (h) In the event it is necessary for a child that has been ordered into foster care for a specified
period of time to be in foster care longer than one year after the permanency hearing held under this
section, not later than 12 months after the time the child was ordered into foster care for a specified
period of time, the matter must be returned to court for a review of the appropriateness of continuing
the child in foster care and of the responsible social services agency's reasonable efforts to finalize
a permanent plan for the child; if it is in the child's best interests to continue the order for foster care
for a specified period of time past a total of 12 months, the court shall set objectives for the child's
continuation in foster care, specify any further amount of time the child may be in foster care, and
review the plan for the safe return of the child to the parent.
3300                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

    (i) An order permanently placing a child out of the home of the parent or guardian must include
the following detailed findings:
   (1) how the child's best interests are served by the order;
    (2) the nature and extent of the responsible social service agency's reasonable efforts, or, in
the case of an Indian child, active efforts to reunify the child with the parent or guardian where
reasonable efforts are required;
    (3) the parent's or parents' efforts and ability to use services to correct the conditions which led
to the out-of-home placement; and
    (4) that the conditions which led to the out-of-home placement have not been corrected so that
the child can safely return home.
    (j) An order for permanent legal and physical custody of a child may be modified under sections
518.18 and 518.185. The social services agency is a party to the proceeding and must receive notice.
A parent may only seek modification of an order for long-term foster care upon motion and a
showing by the parent of a substantial change in the parent's circumstances such that the parent
could provide appropriate care for the child and that removal of the child from the child's permanent
placement and the return to the parent's care would be in the best interest of the child. The responsible
social services agency may ask the court to vacate an order for long-term foster care upon a prima
facie showing that there is a factual basis for the court to order another permanency option under
this chapter and that such an option is in the child's best interests. Upon a hearing where the court
determines that there is a factual basis for vacating the order for long-term foster care and that
another permanent order regarding the placement of the child is in the child's best interests, the court
may vacate the order for long-term foster care and enter a different order for permanent placement
that is in the child's best interests. The court shall not require further reasonable efforts to reunify
the child with the parent or guardian as a basis for vacating the order for long-term foster care and
ordering a different permanent placement in the child's best interests. The county attorney must file
pleadings and give notice as required under the rules of juvenile court in order to modify an order
for long-term foster care under this paragraph.
    (k) The court shall issue an order required under this section within 15 days of the close of the
proceedings. The court may extend issuing the order an additional 15 days when necessary in the
interests of justice and the best interests of the child.
    (l) This paragraph applies to proceedings required under this subdivision when the child is on a
trial home visit:
     (1) if the child is on a trial home visit 12 months after the child was placed in foster care or in the
care of a noncustodial parent as calculated in this subdivision, the responsible social services agency
may file a report with the court regarding the child's and parent's progress on the trial home visit
and its reasonable efforts to finalize the child's safe and permanent return to the care of the parent
in lieu of filing the pleadings required under paragraph (b). The court shall make findings regarding
reasonableness of the responsible social services efforts to finalize the child's return home as the
permanent order in the best interests of the child. The court may continue the trial home visit to a
total time not to exceed six months as provided in subdivision 1. If the court finds the responsible
social services agency has not made reasonable efforts to finalize the child's return home as the
permanent order in the best interests of the child, the court may order other or additional efforts to
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                          3301

support the child remaining in the care of the parent; and
    (2) if a trial home visit ordered or continued at proceedings under this subdivision terminates,
the court shall re-commence proceedings under this subdivision to determine the permanent status
of the child not later than 30 days after the child is returned to foster care.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.212, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Out-of-home placement; plan. (a) An out-of-home placement plan shall be
prepared within 30 days after any child is placed in a residential facility by court order or by the
voluntary release of the child by the parent or parents.
    For purposes of this section, a residential facility means any group home, family foster home
or other publicly supported out-of-home residential facility, including any out-of-home residential
facility under contract with the state, county or other political subdivision, or any agency thereof,
to provide those services or foster care as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 18.
    (b) An out-of-home placement plan means a written document which is prepared by the
responsible social services agency jointly with the parent or parents or guardian of the child and in
consultation with the child's guardian ad litem, the child's tribe, if the child is an Indian child, the
child's foster parent or representative of the residential facility, and, where appropriate, the child.
For a child in placement due solely or in part to the child's emotional disturbance, preparation
of the out-of-home placement plan shall additionally include the child's mental health treatment
provider. As appropriate, the plan shall be:
   (1) submitted to the court for approval under section 260C.178, subdivision 7;
   (2) ordered by the court, either as presented or modified after hearing, under section 260C.178,
subdivision 7, or 260C.201, subdivision 6; and
    (3) signed by the parent or parents or guardian of the child, the child's guardian ad litem, a
representative of the child's tribe, the responsible social services agency, and, if possible, the child.
   (c) The out-of-home placement plan shall be explained to all persons involved in its
implementation, including the child who has signed the plan, and shall set forth:
   (1) a description of the residential facility including how the out-of-home placement plan is
designed to achieve a safe placement for the child in the least restrictive, most family-like, setting
available which is in close proximity to the home of the parent or parents or guardian of the child
when the case plan goal is reunification, and how the placement is consistent with the best interests
and special needs of the child according to the factors under subdivision 2, paragraph (b);
   (2) the specific reasons for the placement of the child in a residential facility, and when
reunification is the plan, a description of the problems or conditions in the home of the parent or
parents which necessitated removal of the child from home and the changes the parent or parents
must make in order for the child to safely return home;
   (3) a description of the services offered and provided to prevent removal of the child from the
home and to reunify the family including:
   (i) the specific actions to be taken by the parent or parents of the child to eliminate or correct the
problems or conditions identified in clause (2), and the time period during which the actions are to
3302                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

be taken; and
    (ii) the reasonable efforts, or in the case of an Indian child, active efforts to be made to achieve
a safe and stable home for the child including social and other supportive services to be provided or
offered to the parent or parents or guardian of the child, the child, and the residential facility during
the period the child is in the residential facility;
    (4) a description of any services or resources that were requested by the child or the child's
parent, guardian, foster parent, or custodian since the date of the child's placement in the residential
facility, and whether those services or resources were provided and if not, the basis for the denial
of the services or resources;
    (5) the visitation plan for the parent or parents or guardian, other relatives as defined in section
260C.007, subdivision 27, and siblings of the child if the siblings are not placed together in the
residential facility, and whether visitation is consistent with the best interest of the child, during the
period the child is in the residential facility;
    (6) documentation of steps to finalize the adoption or legal guardianship of the child if the court
has issued an order terminating the rights of both parents of the child or of the only known, living
parent of the child,
                   ­­­
                     an­. At a minimum, the documentation must include child-specific recruitment
                      ­d
efforts such as relative search and the use of state, regional, and national adoption exchanges to
facilitate orderly and timely placements in and outside of the state. A copy of this documentation
shall be provided to the court in the review required under section 260C.317, subdivision 3,
paragraph (b);

the most recent information available regarding:

    (iv) assurances that the child's placement in foster care takes into account proximity to the school
in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement;
    (v) a record of the child's immunizations;

    (iii) transportation including, where appropriate, assisting the child in obtaining a driver's
license;

    (9) for a child in placement due solely or in part to the child's emotional disturbance, diagnostic
and assessment information, specific services relating to meeting the mental health care needs of
the child, and treatment outcomes.
    (d) The parent or parents or guardian and the child each shall have the right to legal counsel in
the preparation of the case plan and shall be informed of the right at the time of placement of the
child. The child shall also have the right to a guardian ad litem. If unable to employ counsel from
their own resources, the court shall appoint counsel upon the request of the parent or parents or
the child or the child's legal guardian. The parent or parents may also receive assistance from any
person or social services agency in preparation of the case plan.
    After the plan has been agreed upon by the parties involved or approved or ordered by the court,
the foster parents shall be fully informed of the provisions of the case plan and shall be provided a
copy of the plan.
    Upon discharge from foster care, the parent, adoptive parent, or permanent legal and physical
custodian, as appropriate, and the child, if appropriate, must be provided with a current copy of the
child's health and education record.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.212, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Responsible social service agency's duties for children in placement. (a) When a
child is in placement, the responsible social services agency shall make diligent efforts to identify,
locate, and, where appropriate, offer services to both parents of the child.
    (1) The responsible social services agency shall assess whether a noncustodial or nonadjudicated
parent is willing and capable of providing for the day-to-day care of the child temporarily or
permanently. An assessment under this clause may include, but is not limited to, obtaining
information under section 260C.209. If after assessment, the responsible social services agency
determines that a noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent is willing and capable of providing
day-to-day care of the child, the responsible social services agency may seek authority from the
custodial parent or the court to have that parent assume day-to-day care of the child. If a parent is
not an adjudicated parent, the responsible social services agency shall require the nonadjudicated
parent to cooperate with paternity establishment procedures as part of the case plan.
    (2) If, after assessment, the responsible social services agency determines that the child cannot
be in the day-to-day care of either parent, the agency shall:
   (i) prepare an out-of-home placement plan addressing the conditions that each parent must meet
before the child can be in that parent's day-to-day care; and
3304                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [63RD DAY

    (ii) provide a parent who is the subject of a background study under section 260C.209 15 days'
notice that it intends to use the study to recommend against putting the child with that parent, as
well as the notice provided in section 260C.209, subdivision 4, and the court shall afford the parent
an opportunity to be heard concerning the study.
    The results of a background study of a noncustodial parent shall not be used by the agency to
determine that the parent is incapable of providing day-to-day care of the child unless the agency
reasonably believes that placement of the child into the home of that parent would endanger the
child's health, safety, or welfare.
    (3) If, after the provision of services following an out-of-home placement plan under this section,
the child cannot return to the care of the parent from whom the child was removed or who had
legal custody at the time the child was placed in foster care, the agency may petition on behalf of a
noncustodial parent to establish legal custody with that parent under section 260C.201, subdivision
11. If paternity has not already been established, it may be established in the same proceeding in the
manner provided for under chapter 257.
    (4) The responsible social services agency may be relieved of the requirement to locate and
offer services to both parents by the juvenile court upon a finding of good cause after the filing of
a petition under section 260C.141.
    (b) The responsible social services agency shall give notice to the parent or parents or guardian
of each child in a residential facility, other than a child in placement due solely to that child's
developmental disability or emotional disturbance, of the following information:
    (1) that residential care of the child may result in termination of parental rights or an order
permanently placing the child out of the custody of the parent, but only after notice and a hearing
as required under chapter 260C and the juvenile court rules;
   (2) time limits on the length of placement and of reunification services, including the date on
which the child is expected to be returned to and safely maintained in the home of the parent or
parents or placed for adoption or otherwise permanently removed from the care of the parent by
court order;
   (3) the nature of the services available to the parent;
    (4) the consequences to the parent and the child if the parent fails or is unable to use services to
correct the circumstances that led to the child's placement;
   (5) the first consideration for placement with relatives;
    (6) the benefit to the child in getting the child out of residential care as soon as possible,
preferably by returning the child home, but if that is not possible, through a permanent legal
placement of the child away from the parent;
    (7) when safe for the child, the benefits to the child and the parent of maintaining visitation with
the child as soon as possible in the course of the case and, in any event, according to the visitation
plan under this section; and
    (8) the financial responsibilities and obligations, if any, of the parent or parents for the support
of the child during the period the child is in the residential facility.
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3305

    (c) The responsible social services agency shall inform a parent considering voluntary
placement of a child who is not developmentally disabled or emotionally disturbed of the following
information:
    (1) the parent and the child each has a right to separate legal counsel before signing a voluntary
placement agreement, but not to counsel appointed at public expense;
    (2) the parent is not required to agree to the voluntary placement, and a parent who enters a
voluntary placement agreement may at any time request that the agency return the child. If the parent
so requests, the child must be returned within 24 hours of the receipt of the request;
    (3) evidence gathered during the time the child is voluntarily placed may be used at a later time
as the basis for a petition alleging that the child is in need of protection or services or as the basis
for a petition seeking termination of parental rights or other permanent placement of the child away
from the parent;
    (4) if the responsible social services agency files a petition alleging that the child is in need of
protection or services or a petition seeking the termination of parental rights or other permanent
placement of the child away from the parent, the parent would have the right to appointment of
separate legal counsel and the child would have a right to the appointment of counsel and a guardian
ad litem as provided by law, and that counsel will be appointed at public expense if they are unable
to afford counsel; and
    (5) the timelines and procedures for review of voluntary placements under subdivision 3, and
the effect the time spent in voluntary placement on the scheduling of a permanent placement
determination hearing under section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
    (d) When an agency accepts a child for placement, the agency shall determine whether the child
has had a physical examination by or under the direction of a licensed physician within the 12 months
immediately preceding the date when the child came into the agency's care. If there is documentation
that the child has had an examination within the last 12 months, the agency is responsible for seeing
that the child has another physical examination within one year of the documented examination
and annually in subsequent years. If the agency determines that the child has not had a physical
examination within the 12 months immediately preceding placement, the agency shall ensure that
the child has an examination within 30 days of coming into the agency's care and once a year in
subsequent years.
    (e) If a child leaves foster care by reason of having attained the age of majority under state law,
the child must be given at no cost a copy of the child's health and education report.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.212, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Review of certain child placements. (a) When a developmentally disabled child or
emotionally disturbed child needs placement in a residential facility for the sole reason of accessing
services or a level of skilled care that cannot be provided in the parent's home, the child must be
placed pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement between the responsible social services agency
and the child's parent. The voluntary placement agreement must give the responsible social services
agency legal responsibility for the child's physical care, custody, and control, but must not transfer
legal custody of the child to the agency. The voluntary placement agreement must be executed
in a form developed and promulgated by the commissioner of human services. The responsible
3306                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

social services agency shall report to the commissioner the number of children who are the subject
of a voluntary placement agreement under this subdivision and other information regarding these
children as the commissioner may require.
    (b) If a developmentally disabled child or a child diagnosed as emotionally disturbed has been
placed in a residential facility pursuant to a voluntary release by the child's parent or parents because
of the child's disabling conditions or need for long-term residential treatment or supervision, the
social services agency responsible for the placement shall report to the court and bring a petition for
review of the child's foster care status as required in section 260C.141, subdivision 2a.

    (b
     ­­) (c) If a child is in placement due solely to the child's developmental disability or emotional
disturbance, ­  an ­ the court finds compelling reasons not to proceed under section 260C.201,

under section 260C.201, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), ­      an
                                                                          ­­d no petition is required by
section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
    ­
    (­) (d) Whenever a petition for review is brought pursuant to this subdivision, a guardian ad
     c­
litem shall be appointed for the child.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.317, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Order; retention of jurisdiction. (a) A certified copy of the findings and the order
terminating parental rights, and a summary of the court's information concerning the child shall be
furnished by the court to the commissioner or the agency to which guardianship is transferred. The
orders shall be on a document separate from the findings. The court shall furnish the individual to
whom guardianship is transferred a copy of the order terminating parental rights.
    (b) The court shall retain jurisdiction in a case where adoption is the intended permanent
placement disposition until the child's adoption is finalized, the child is 18 years of age, or the
child is otherwise ordered discharged from the jurisdiction of the court. The guardian ad litem and
counsel for the child shall continue on the case until an adoption decree is entered. A hearing must
be held every 90 days following termination of parental rights for the court to review progress
toward an adoptive placement and the specific recruitment efforts the agency has taken to find an
adoptive family or other placement living arrangement for the child and to finalize the adoption
or other permanency plan.
    (c) The responsible social services agency may make a determination of compelling reasons
for a child to be in long-term foster care when the agency has made exhaustive efforts to recruit,
identify, and place the child in an adoptive home, and the child continues in foster care for at least
24 months after the court has issued the order terminating parental rights. A child of any age who
is under the guardianship of the commissioner of the Department of Human Services and is legally
available for adoption may not refuse or waive the commissioner's agent's exhaustive efforts to
recruit, identify, and place the child in an adoptive home required under paragraph (b) or sign a
document relieving county social services agencies of all recruitment efforts on the child's behalf.
Upon approving the agency's determination of compelling reasons, the court may order the child
placed in long-term foster care. At least every 12 months thereafter as long as the child continues in
out-of-home placement, the court shall conduct a permanency review hearing to determine the future
status of the child using the review requirements of section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (g).
   (d) The court shall retain jurisdiction through the child's minority in a case where long-term foster

care is the permanent disposition whether under paragraph (c) or section 260C.201, subdivision 11.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.331, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Care, examination, or treatment. (a) Except where parental rights are
terminated,
   (1) whenever legal custody of a child is transferred by the court to a responsible social services
agency,
   (2) whenever legal custody is transferred to a person other than the responsible social services
agency, but under the supervision of the responsible social services agency, or
    (3) whenever a child is given physical or mental examinations or treatment under order of the
court, and no provision is otherwise made by law for payment for the care, examination, or treatment
of the child, these costs are a charge upon the welfare funds of the county in which proceedings are
held upon certification of the judge of juvenile court.
    (b) The court shall order, and the responsible social services agency shall require, the parents or
custodian of a child, while the child is under the age of 18, to use the total income and resources
attributable to the child for the period of care, examination, or treatment, except for clothing and
personal needs allowance as provided in section 256B.35, to reimburse the county for the cost of
care, examination, or treatment. Income and resources attributable to the child include, but are not
limited to, Social Security benefits, supplemental security income (SSI), veterans benefits, railroad
retirement benefits and child support. When the child is over the age of 18, and continues to receive
care, examination, or treatment, the court shall order, and the responsible social services agency
shall require, reimbursement from the child for the cost of care, examination, or treatment from
the income and resources attributable to the child less the clothing and personal needs allowance.
Income does not include earnings from a child over the age of 18 who is working as part of a plan
under section 260C.212, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), clause (8), to transition from foster care.
    (c) If the income and resources attributable to the child are not enough to reimburse the county
for the full cost of the care, examination, or treatment, the court shall inquire into the ability of the
parents to support the child and, after giving the parents a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the
court shall order, and the responsible social services agency shall require, the parents to contribute
to the cost of care, examination, or treatment of the child. When determining the amount to be
contributed by the parents, the court shall use a fee schedule based upon ability to pay that is
established by the responsible social services agency and approved by the commissioner of human
services. The income of a stepparent who has not adopted a child shall be excluded in calculating
the parental contribution under this section.
    (d) The court shall order the amount of reimbursement attributable to the parents or custodian,
or attributable to the child, or attributable to both sources, withheld under chapter 518A from the
income of the parents or the custodian of the child. A parent or custodian who fails to pay without
good reason may be proceeded against for contempt, or the court may inform the county attorney,
who shall proceed to collect the unpaid sums, or both procedures may be used.
    (e) If the court orders a physical or mental examination for a child, the examination is a medically
necessary service for purposes of determining whether the service is covered by a health insurance
policy, health maintenance contract, or other health coverage plan. Court-ordered treatment shall
3308                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

be subject to policy, contract, or plan requirements for medical necessity. Nothing in this paragraph
changes or eliminates benefit limits, conditions of coverage, co-payments or deductibles, provider
restrictions, or other requirements in the policy, contract, or plan that relate to coverage of other
medically necessary services.

    (3) failure to provide for necessary supervision or child care arrangements appropriate for a child
after considering factors as the child's age, mental ability, physical condition, length of absence, or
environment, when the child is unable to care for the child's own basic needs or safety, or the basic
needs or safety of another child in their care;
   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,
subdivision 11, which does not include a parent's refusal to provide the parent's child with
sympathomimetic medications, consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5;
     (5) nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that a child is neglected solely because
the child's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and
depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report
pursuant to subdivision 3, has a duty to report if a lack of medical care may cause serious danger
to the child's health. This section does not impose upon persons, not otherwise legally responsible
3310                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

    (g) "Physical abuse" means any physical injury, mental injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a

   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3e. Agency responsibility for assessing or investigating reports of sexual abuse. The
local welfare agency is the agency responsible for investigating allegations of sexual abuse if the
alleged offender is the parent, guardian, sibling, or an individual functioning within the family unit
as a person responsible for the child's care, or a person with a significant relationship to the child if
that person resides in the child's household.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3f. Law enforcement agency responsibility for investigating maltreatment. The local
law enforcement agency has responsibility for investigating any report of child maltreatment if
a violation of a criminal statute is alleged. Law enforcement and the responsible agency must
coordinate their investigations or assessments as required under subdivision 10.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Duties of local welfare agency and local law enforcement agency upon receipt of
a report. (a) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall determine whether to conduct
a family assessment or an investigation as appropriate to prevent or provide a remedy for child
maltreatment. The local welfare agency:
   (1) shall conduct an investigation on reports involving substantial child endangerment;
    (2) shall begin an immediate investigation if, at any time when it is using a family assessment
response, it determines that there is reason to believe that substantial child endangerment or a serious
threat to the child's safety exists;
   (3) may conduct a family assessment for reports that do not allege substantial child
endangerment. In determining that a family assessment is appropriate, the local welfare agency may
consider issues of child safety, parental cooperation, and the need for an immediate response; and
   (4) may conduct a family assessment on a report that was initially screened and assigned for an
investigation. In determining that a complete investigation is not required, the local welfare agency
must document the reason for terminating the investigation and notify the local law enforcement
agency if the local law enforcement agency is conducting a joint investigation.
    If the report alleges neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, or individual
functioning within the family unit as a person responsible for the child's care, or sexual abuse by a
person with a significant relationship to the child when that person resides in the child's household
or by a sibling, the local welfare agency shall immediately conduct a family assessment or
investigation as identified in clauses (1) to (4). In conducting a family assessment or investigation,
the local welfare agency shall gather information on the existence of substance abuse and domestic
violence and offer services for purposes of preventing future child maltreatment, safeguarding and
enhancing the welfare of the abused or neglected minor, and supporting and preserving family life
whenever possible. If the report alleges a violation of a criminal statute involving sexual abuse,
3314                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

physical abuse, or neglect or endangerment, under section 609.378, the local law enforcement
agency and local welfare agency shall coordinate the planning and execution of their respective
investigation and assessment efforts to avoid a duplication of fact-finding efforts and multiple
interviews. Each agency shall prepare a separate report of the results of its investigation. In cases
of alleged child maltreatment resulting in death, the local agency may rely on the fact-finding
efforts of a law enforcement investigation to make a determination of whether or not maltreatment
occurred. When necessary the local welfare agency shall seek authority to remove the child from
the custody of a parent, guardian, or adult with whom the child is living. In performing any of these
duties, the local welfare agency shall maintain appropriate records.
   If the family assessment or investigation indicates there is a potential for abuse of alcohol or other
drugs by the parent, guardian, or person responsible for the child's care, the local welfare agency shall
conduct a chemical use assessment pursuant to Minnesota Rules, part 9530.6615. The local welfare
agency shall report the determination of the chemical use assessment, and the recommendations
and referrals for alcohol and other drug treatment services to the state authority on alcohol and drug
abuse.
    (b) When a local agency receives a report or otherwise has information indicating that a child
who is a client, as defined in section 245.91, has been the subject of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or
neglect at an agency, facility, or program as defined in section 245.91, it shall, in addition to its other
duties under this section, immediately inform the ombudsman established under sections 245.91 to
245.97. The commissioner of education shall inform the ombudsman established under sections
245.91 to 245.97 of reports regarding a child defined as a client in section 245.91 that maltreatment
occurred at a school as defined in sections 120A.05, subdivisions 9, 11, and 13, and 124D.10.
    (c) Authority of the local welfare agency responsible for assessing or investigating the child
abuse or neglect report, the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report, and of the
local law enforcement agency for investigating the alleged abuse or neglect includes, but is not
limited to, authority to interview, without parental consent, the alleged victim and any other minors
who currently reside with or who have resided with the alleged offender. The interview may take
place at school or at any facility or other place where the alleged victim or other minors might be
found or the child may be transported to, and the interview conducted at, a place appropriate for
the interview of a child designated by the local welfare agency or law enforcement agency. The
interview may take place outside the presence of the alleged offender or parent, legal custodian,
guardian, or school official. For family assessments, it is the preferred practice to request a parent
or guardian's permission to interview the child prior to conducting the child interview, unless doing
so would compromise the safety assessment. Except as provided in this paragraph, the parent,
legal custodian, or guardian shall be notified by the responsible local welfare or law enforcement
agency no later than the conclusion of the investigation or assessment that this interview has
occurred. Notwithstanding rule 4  ­9­­0

                                        2 32 of the Minnesota Rules of Procedure for Juvenile Courts,
the juvenile court may, after hearing on an ex parte motion by the local welfare agency, order that,
where reasonable cause exists, the agency withhold notification of this interview from the parent,
legal custodian, or guardian. If the interview took place or is to take place on school property, the
order shall specify that school officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian
the contents of the notification of intent to interview the child on school property, as provided under
this paragraph, and any other related information regarding the interview that may be a part of the
child's school record. A copy of the order shall be sent by the local welfare or law enforcement
agency to the appropriate school official.
63RD DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3315

    (d) When the local welfare, local law enforcement agency, or the agency responsible for
assessing or investigating a report of maltreatment determines that an interview should take place
on school property, written notification of intent to interview the child on school property must be
received by school officials prior to the interview. The notification shall include the name of the
child to be interviewed, the purpose of the interview, and a reference to the statutory authority to
conduct an interview on school property. For interviews conducted by the local welfare agency, the
notification shall be signed by the chair of the local social services agency or the chair's designee.
The notification shall be private data on individuals subject to the provisions of this paragraph.
School officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian the contents of the
notification or any other related information regarding the interview until notified in writing by the
local welfare or law enforcement agency that the investigation or assessment has been concluded,
unless a school employee or agent is alleged to have maltreated the child. Until that time, the
local welfare or law enforcement agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating
a report of maltreatment shall be solely responsible for any disclosures regarding the nature of the
assessment or investigation.
    Except where the alleged offender is believed to be a school official or employee, the time and
place, and manner of the interview on school premises shall be within the discretion of school
officials, but the local welfare or law enforcement agency shall have the exclusive authority to
determine who may attend the interview. The conditions as to time, place, and manner of the
interview set by the school officials shall be reasonable and the interview shall be conducted not
more than 24 hours after the receipt of the notification unless another time is considered necessary
by agreement between the school officials and the local welfare or law enforcement agency. Where
the school fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph, the juvenile court may order the
school to comply. Every effort must be made to reduce the disruption of the educational program
of the child, other students, or school staff when an interview is conducted on school premises.
    (e) Where the alleged offender or a person responsible for the care of the alleged victim or other
minor prevents access to the victim or other minor by the local welfare agency, the juvenile court
may order the parents, legal custodian, or guardian to produce the alleged victim or other minor for
questioning by the local welfare agency or the local law enforcement agency outside the presence
of the alleged offender or any person responsible for the child's care at reasonable places and times
as specified by court order.
    (f) Before making an order under paragraph (e), the court shall issue an order to show cause,
either upon its own motion or upon a verified petition, specifying the basis for the requested
interviews and fixing the time and place of the hearing. The order to show cause shall be served
personally and shall be heard in the same manner as provided in other cases in the juvenile court.
The court shall consider the need for appointment of a guardian ad litem to protect the best interests
of the child. If appointed, the guardian ad litem shall be present at the hearing on the order to show
cause.
    (g) The commissioner of human services, the ombudsman for mental health and developmental
disabilities, the local welfare agencies responsible for investigating reports, the commissioner of
education, and the local law enforcement agencies have the right to enter facilities as defined in
subdivision 2 and to inspect and copy the facility's records, including medical records, as part of the
investigation. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 13, they also have the right to inform the
facility under investigation that they are conducting an investigation, to disclose to the facility the
3316                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

names of the individuals under investigation for abusing or neglecting a child, and to provide the
facility with a copy of the report and the investigative findings.
    (h) The local welfare agency responsible for conducting a family assessment or investigation
shall collect available and relevant information to determine child safety, risk of subsequent child
maltreatment, and family strengths and needs and share not public information with an Indian's
tribal social services agency without violating any law of the state that may otherwise impose duties
of confidentiality on the local welfare agency in order to implement the tribal state agreement. The
local welfare agency or the agency responsible for investigating the report shall collect available and
relevant information to ascertain whether maltreatment occurred and whether protective services
are needed. Information collected includes, when relevant, information with regard to the person
reporting the alleged maltreatment, including the nature of the reporter's relationship to the child and
to the alleged offender, and the basis of the reporter's knowledge for the report; the child allegedly
being maltreated; the alleged offender; the child's caretaker; and other collateral sources having
relevant information related to the alleged maltreatment. The local welfare agency or the agency
responsible for assessing or investigating the report may make a determination of no maltreatment
early in an assessment, and close the case and retain immunity, if the collected information shows
no basis for a full assessment or investigation.
   Information relevant to the assessment or investigation must be asked for, and may include:
    (1) the child's sex and age, prior reports of maltreatment, information relating to developmental
functioning, credibility of the child's statement, and whether the information provided under
this clause is consistent with other information collected during the course of the assessment or
investigation;
    (2) the alleged offender's age, a record check for prior reports of maltreatment, and criminal
charges and convictions. The local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing
or investigating the report must provide the alleged offender with an opportunity to make a
statement. The alleged offender may submit supporting documentation relevant to the assessment
or investigation;
    (3) collateral source information regarding the alleged maltreatment and care of the child.
Collateral information includes, when relevant: (i) a medical examination of the child; (ii) prior
medical records relating to the alleged maltreatment or the care of the child maintained by any
facility, clinic, or health care professional and an interview with the treating professionals; and (iii)
interviews with the child's caretakers, including the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, child
care provider, teachers, counselors, family members, relatives, and other persons who may have
knowledge regarding the alleged maltreatment and the care of the child; and
   (4) information on the existence of domestic abuse and violence in the home of the child, and
substance abuse.
    Nothing in this paragraph precludes the local welfare agency, the local law enforcement agency,
or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report from collecting other relevant
information necessary to conduct the assessment or investigation. Notwithstanding section 13.384
or 144.335, the local welfare agency has access to medical data and records for purposes of clause
(3). Notwithstanding the data's classification in the possession of any other agency, data acquired by
the local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report during
the course of the assessment or investigation are private data on individuals and must be maintained
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                           3317

in accordance with subdivision 11. Data of the commissioner of education collected or maintained
during and for the purpose of an investigation of alleged maltreatment in a school are governed
by this section, notwithstanding the data's classification as educational, licensing, or personnel data
under chapter 13.
    In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in subdivision
2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect investigative reports and data that are
relevant to a report of maltreatment and are from local law enforcement and the school facility.
    (i) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall conduct a face-to-face contact with
the child reported to be maltreated and with the child's primary caregiver sufficient to complete a
safety assessment and ensure the immediate safety of the child. The face-to-face contact with the
child and primary caregiver shall occur immediately if substantial child endangerment is alleged and
within five calendar days for all other reports. If the alleged offender was not already interviewed
as the primary caregiver, the local welfare agency shall also conduct a face-to-face interview with
the alleged offender in the early stages of the assessment or investigation. At the initial contact, the
local child welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report must
inform the alleged offender of the complaints or allegations made against the individual in a manner
consistent with laws protecting the rights of the person who made the report. The interview with the
alleged offender may be postponed if it would jeopardize an active law enforcement investigation.
    (j) When conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall use a question and answer
interviewing format with questioning as nondirective as possible to elicit spontaneous responses.
For investigations only, the following interviewing methods and procedures must be used whenever
possible when collecting information:
   (1) audio recordings of all interviews with witnesses and collateral sources; and
    (2) in cases of alleged sexual abuse, audio-video recordings of each interview with the alleged
victim and child witnesses.
    (k) In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in
subdivision 2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect available and relevant
information and use the procedures in paragraphs (i), (k), and subdivision 3d, except that the
requirement for face-to-face observation of the child and face-to-face interview of the alleged
offender is to occur in the initial stages of the assessment or investigation provided that the
commissioner may also base the assessment or investigation on investigative reports and data
received from the school facility and local law enforcement, to the extent those investigations
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (i) and (k), and subdivision 3d.

   (b) The local agency may rely on the fact-finding efforts of the law enforcement investigation
conducted under this subdivision to make a determination whether or not threatened harm or other
maltreatment has occurred under subdivision 2 if an alleged offender has minor children or lives
with minors.
    (c) The local welfare agency shall offer appropriate social services for the purpose of
safeguarding and enhancing the welfare of the abused or neglected minor.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10c, is amended to read:

If the report alleges medical neglect as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 4 ­ 6, clause (5), the
local welfare agency shall, in addition to its other duties under this section, immediately consult
with designated hospital staff and with the parents of the infant to verify that appropriate nutrition,
hydration, and medication are being provided; and shall immediately secure an independent
medical review of the infant's medical charts and records and, if necessary, seek a court order for an
independent medical examination of the infant. If the review or examination leads to a conclusion
of medical neglect, the agency shall intervene on behalf of the infant by initiating legal proceedings
under section 260C.141 and by filing an expedited motion to prevent the withholding of medically
indicated treatment.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10f, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10f. Notice of determinations. Within ten working days of the conclusion of a family
assessment, the local welfare agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of the need
for services to address child safety concerns or significant risk of subsequent child maltreatment.
The local welfare agency and the family may also jointly agree that family support and family
preservation services are needed. Within ten working days of the conclusion of an investigation,
the local welfare agency or agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report shall
notify the parent or guardian of the child, the person determined to be maltreating the child, and if
applicable, the director of the facility, of the determination and a summary of the specific reasons
for the determination. The notice must also include a certification that the information collection
procedures under subdivision 10, paragraphs (h), (i), and (j), were followed and a notice of the
right of a data subject to obtain access to other private data on the subject collected, created, or
maintained under this section. In addition, the notice shall include the length of time that the records
will be kept under subdivision 11c. The investigating agency shall notify the parent or guardian of
the child who is the subject of the report, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated
a child, of their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.022. The notice must also
state that a finding of maltreatment may result in denial of a license application or background
study disqualification under chapter 245C related to employment or services that are licensed by
the Department of Human Services under chapter 245A, the Department of Health under chapter

   A family's monthly co-payment fee is the fixed percentage established for the income range
multiplied by the highest possible income within that income range.
    Subd. 2. Parent fee. A family must be assessed a parent fee for each service period. A family's
parent fee must be a fixed percentage of its annual gross income. Parent fees must apply to families
eligible for child care assistance under sections 119B.03 and 119B.05. Income must be as defined
in section 119B.011, subdivision 15. The fixed percent is based on the relationship of the family's
annual gross income to 100 percent of the annual federal poverty guidelines. Parent fees must begin
at 75 percent of the poverty level. The minimum parent fees for families between 75 percent and
100 percent of poverty level must be ­    $1­­
                                             0 $5 per month. Parent fees must provide for graduated
movement to full payment. Payment of part or all of a family's parent fee directly to the family's child
care provider on behalf of the family by a source other than the family shall not affect the family's
eligibility for child care assistance, and the amount paid shall be excluded from the family's income.
Child care providers who accept third-party payments must maintain family specific documentation
of payment source, amount, and time period covered by the payment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. (a) This section is effective July 1, 2007.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2008, the parent fee scale for families with incomes greater than or equal
to 100 percent of FPG shall be converted to state median income for a family size of three, adjusted
for family size, as directed in section 119B.09, subdivision 12.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 119B.125, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Persons who cannot be authorized. (a) A person who meets any of the conditions
under paragraphs (b) to (n) must not be authorized as a legal nonlicensed family child care provider.
To determine whether any of the listed conditions exist, the county must request information about
the provider from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the juvenile courts, and social service
agencies. When one of the listed entities does not maintain information on a statewide basis, the
county must contact the entity in the county where the provider resides and any other county in
which the provider previously resided in the past year. For purposes of this subdivision, a finding
that a delinquency petition is proven in juvenile court must be considered a conviction in state

by child care providers in Minnesota to determine the 75th percentile for like-care arrangements in
counties. When the commissioner determines that, using the commissioner's established protocol,
the number of providers responding to the survey is too small to determine the 75th percentile rate
for like-care arrangements in a county or multicounty region, the commissioner may establish the
75th percentile maximum rate based on like-care arrangements in a county, region, or category that
the commissioner deems to be similar.
   (d) A rate which includes a special needs rate paid under subdivision 3 or under a school
readiness service agreement paid under section 61 may be in excess of the maximum rate allowed
under this subdivision.
   (e) The department shall monitor the effect of this paragraph on provider rates. The county
shall pay the provider's full charges for every child in care up to the maximum established. The

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 119B.13, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Provider rate differential for accreditation. A family child care provider or
child care center shall be paid a 15 percent differential above the maximum rate established
in subdivision 1, up to the actual provider rate, if the provider or center holds a current early
childhood development credential or is accredited. For a family child care provider, early
childhood development credential and accreditation includes an individual who has earned a
child development associate degree, a child development associate credential, a diploma in child
development from a Minnesota state technical college, or a bachelor's or post baccalaureate degree
in early childhood education from an accredited college or university, or who is accredited by the
National Association for Family Child Care or the Competency Based Training and Assessment
Program. For a child care center, accreditation includes accreditation by the National Association

ten days of the end of the service period, a county or the state shall issue payment to the provider of
child care under the child care fund within 30 days of receiving a bill from the provider. Counties
or the state may establish policies that make payments on a more frequent basis.

                  ­ If a provider has received an authorization of care and has been issued a billing form
for an eligible family, the bill must be submitted within 60 days of the last date of service on the bill.
A county may pay a bill submitted more than 60 days after the last date of service if the provider
shows good cause why the bill was not submitted within 60 days. Good cause must be defined in
the county's child care fund plan under section 119B.08, subdivision 3, and the definition of good
cause must include county error. A county may not pay any bill submitted more than a year after
the last date of service on the bill.
    (d) If a provider provided care for a time period without receiving an authorization of care and a
billing form for an eligible family, payment of child care assistance may only be made retroactively
for a maximum of six months from the date the provider is issued an authorization of care and a
billing form.

county materially false information on the provider's billing forms.

this subdivision, the payments must be made in compliance with section 16A.124.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 119B.13, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Absent days. (a) Child care providers may not be reimbursed for more than 25 full-day
absent days per child, excluding holidays, in a fiscal year, or for more than ten consecutive full-day
absent days, unless the child has a documented medical condition that causes more frequent
absences. Absences due to a documented medical condition of a parent or sibling who lives in the
same residence as the child receiving child care assistance do not count against the 25-day absent
day limit in a fiscal year. Documentation of medical conditions must be on the forms and submitted
according to the timelines established by the commissioner. A public health nurse or school nurse
may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a provider sends a child home early due
to a medical reason, including, but not limited to, fever or contagious illness, the child care center
director or lead teacher may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a child attends for
part of the time authorized to be in care in a day, but is absent for part of the time authorized to be
in care in that same day, the absent time will be reimbursed but the time will not count toward the
ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits. Children in families where at least one parent
is under the age of 21, does not have a high school or general equivalency diploma, and is a student
in a school district or another similar program that provides or arranges for child care, as well as
parenting, social services, career and employment supports, and academic support to achieve high
school graduation, may be exempt from the absent day limits upon request of the program and
approval of the county. If a child attends part of an authorized day, payment to the provider must
be for the full amount of care authorized for that day. Child care providers may only be reimbursed
for absent days if the provider has a written policy for child absences and charges all other families
in care for similar absences.
    (b) Child care providers must be reimbursed for up to ten federal or state holidays or designated
holidays per year when the provider charges all families for these days and the holiday or designated
holiday falls on a day when the child is authorized to be in attendance. Parents may substitute other
cultural or religious holidays for the ten recognized state and federal holidays. Holidays do not count
toward the ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits.
    (c) A family or child care provider may not be assessed an overpayment for an absent day
payment unless (1) there was an error in the amount of care authorized for the family, (2) all of
the allowed full-day absent payments for the child have been paid, or (3) the family or provider did
not timely report a change as required under law.
    (d) The provider and family must receive notification of the number of absent days used upon
initial provider authorization for a family and when the family has used 15 cumulative absent days.
Upon statewide implementation of the Minnesota Electronic Child Care System, the provider and
family authorization for a family and ongoing notification of the number of absent days used as of
the date of the notification.
   (e) A county may pay for more absent days than the statewide absent day policy established
under this subdivision if current market practice in the county justifies payment for those additional

days. County policies for payment of absent days in excess of the statewide absent day policy and
justification for these county policies must be included in the county's child care fund plan under
section 119B.08, subdivision 3. This paragraph may be implemented by counties on or after July 1,
2008.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 119B.21, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Child care services grants. (a) A child care resource and referral program designated
under section 119B.19, subdivision 1a, may award child care services grants for:
    (1) creating new licensed child care facilities and expanding existing facilities, including, but
not limited to, supplies, equipment, facility renovation, and remodeling;
   (2) improving licensed child care facility programs;
    (3) staff training and development services including, but not limited to, in-service training,
curriculum development, accreditation, certification, consulting, resource centers, ­  a­nd

maintain business management systems;
   (6) emergency assistance for child care programs;
   (7) new programs or projects for the creation, expansion, or improvement of programs that serve
ethnic immigrant and refugee communities; and
    (8) targeted recruitment initiatives to expand and build the capacity of the child care system and
to improve the quality of care provided by legal nonlicensed child care providers.
    (b) A child care resource and referral program designated under section 119B.19, subdivision
1a, may award child care services grants to:
   (1) licensed providers;
   (2) providers in the process of being licensed;
   (3) corporations or public agencies that develop or provide child care services;
   (4) school-age care programs; or
   (5) any combination of clauses (1) to (4).
Unlicensed providers are only eligible for grants under paragraph (a), clause (7).
    (c) A recipient of a child care services grant for facility improvements, interim financing, or staff
training and development must provide a 25 percent local match.

States territories of prior residence, counts toward the 60-month limitation. Months during which
any cash assistance is received by an assistance unit with a mandatory member who is disqualified
for wrongfully obtaining public assistance under section 256.98, subdivision 8, counts toward the
time limit for the disqualified member. The 60-month limit applies to a minor caregiver except under

holiday.
   Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.49, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Work activity. "Work activity" means any activity in a participant's approved

   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.521, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Assessments. (a) For purposes of MFIP employment services, assessment is a
continuing process of gathering information related to employability for the purpose of identifying
both participant's strengths and strategies for coping with issues that interfere with employment.
The job counselor must use information from the assessment process to develop and update the
employment plan under subdivision 2 or 3, as appropriate, ­a­
                                                            nd­ to determine whether the participant
qualifies for a family violence waiver including an employment plan under subdivision 3, and to
determine whether the participant should be referred to the family stabilization services program
under section 256J.575.
   (b) The scope of assessment must cover at least the following areas:
    (1) basic information about the participant's ability to obtain and retain employment, including: a
review of the participant's education level; interests, skills, and abilities; prior employment or work
experience; transferable work skills; child care and transportation needs;
   (2) identification of personal and family circumstances that impact the participant's ability to
obtain and retain employment, including: any special needs of the children, the level of English
proficiency, family violence issues, and any involvement with social services or the legal system;
    (3) the results of a mental and chemical health screening tool designed by the commissioner
and results of the brief screening tool for special learning needs. Screening tools for mental and
chemical health and special learning needs must be approved by the commissioner and may only
be administered by job counselors or county staff trained in using such screening tools. The
commissioner shall work with county agencies to develop protocols for referrals and follow-up
actions after screens are administered to participants, including guidance on how employment
plans may be modified based upon outcomes of certain screens. Participants must be told of the
purpose of the screens and how the information will be used to assist the participant in identifying
and overcoming barriers to employment. Screening for mental and chemical health and special
learning needs must be completed by participants who are unable to find suitable employment after
six weeks of job search under subdivision 2, paragraph (b), and participants who are determined to
have barriers to employment under subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Failure to complete the screens
will result in sanction under section 256J.46; and
  (4) a comprehensive review of participation and progress for participants who have received
MFIP assistance and have not worked in unsubsidized employment during the past 12 months.

13, or referral to the family stabilization services program under section 256J.575.
   (c) Information gathered during a caregiver's participation in the diversionary work program

    (d) The job counselor may require the participant to complete a professional chemical use
assessment to be performed according to the rules adopted under section 254A.03, subdivision 3,
including provisions in the administrative rules which recognize the cultural background of the
participant, or a professional psychological assessment as a component of the assessment process,
when the job counselor has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that a participant's
ability to obtain and retain suitable employment is impaired by a medical condition. The job
counselor may assist the participant with arranging services, including child care assistance and
transportation, necessary to meet needs identified by the assessment. Data gathered as part of a
professional assessment must be classified and disclosed according to the provisions in section
13.46.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.521, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Employment plan; contents. (a) Based on the assessment under subdivision 1, the
job counselor and the participant must develop an employment plan that includes participation in
activities and hours that meet the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1. The purpose of the
employment plan is to identify for each participant the most direct path to unsubsidized employment
and any subsequent steps that support long-term economic stability. The employment plan should
be developed using the highest level of activity appropriate for the participant. Activities must be
chosen from clauses (1) to (6), which are listed in order of preference. Notwithstanding this order
of preference for activities, priority must be given for activities related to a family violence waiver
when developing the employment plan. The employment plan must also list the specific steps the
participant will take to obtain employment, including steps necessary for the participant to progress
from one level of activity to another, and a timetable for completion of each step. Levels of activity
include:
   (1) unsubsidized employment;
   (2) job search;
   (3) subsidized employment or unpaid work experience;
   (4) unsubsidized employment and job readiness education or job skills training;
    (5) unsubsidized employment or unpaid work experience and activities related to a family
violence waiver or preemployment needs; and
   (6) activities related to a family violence waiver or preemployment needs.
    (b) Participants who are determined to possess sufficient skills such that the participant is likely
to succeed in obtaining unsubsidized employment must job search at least 30 hours per week for up
to six weeks and accept any offer of suitable employment. The remaining hours necessary to meet
the requirements of section 256J.55, subdivision 1, may be met through participation in other work
activities under section 256J.49, subdivision 13. The participant's employment plan must specify, at
3348                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                      [63RD DAY

a minimum: (1) whether the job search is supervised or unsupervised; (2) support services that will
be provided; and (3) how frequently the participant must report to the job counselor. Participants
who are unable to find suitable employment after six weeks must meet with the job counselor to
determine whether other activities in paragraph (a) should be incorporated into the employment
plan. Job search activities which are continued after six weeks must be structured and supervised.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2004, activities and hourly requirements in the employment plan may
be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the personal and family circumstances of participants
identified under section 256J.561, subdivision 2, paragraph (d). Participants who no longer meet
the provisions of section 256J.561, subdivision 2, paragraph (d), must meet with the job counselor
within ten days of the determination to revise the employment plan.
    (d) Participants who are determined to have barriers to obtaining or retaining employment that
will not be overcome during six weeks of job search under paragraph (b) must work with the job
counselor to develop an employment plan that addresses those barriers by incorporating appropriate
activities from paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6). The employment plan must include enough hours
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, unless a compelling reason
to require fewer hours is noted in the participant's file.
    (e) The job counselor and the participant must sign the employment plan to indicate agreement
on the contents.

activities in order to meet the federal hourly participation rates.
    (g) When a participant fails to meet the agreed upon hours of participation in paid employment
because the participant is not eligible for holiday pay and the participant's place of employment
is closed for a holiday, the job counselor shall not impose a sanction or increase the hours of
participation in any other activity, including paid employment, to offset the hours that were missed
due to the holiday.

which result in a combined total of at least 55 hours per week of work activities.
   (e) Failure to participate in employment services, including the requirement to develop and
comply with an employment plan, including hourly requirements, without good cause under section
256J.57, shall result in the imposition of a sanction under section 256J.46.
   Sec. 41. [256J.575] FAMILY STABILIZATION SERVICES.
    Subdivision 1. Purpose. (a) The family stabilization services serve families who are not making
significant progress within the Minnesota family investment program (MFIP) due to a variety of
barriers to employment.
   (b) The goal of the services is to stabilize and improve the lives of families at risk of long-term
welfare dependency or family instability due to employment barriers such as physical disability,
mental disability, age, or providing care for a disabled household member. These services promote
and support families to achieve the greatest possible degree of self-sufficiency.
    Subd. 2. Definitions. The terms used in this section have the meanings given them in paragraphs
(a) to (d).
   (a) "Case manager" means the county-designated staff person or employment services counselor.
    (b) "Case management" means the services provided by or through the county agency or through
the employment services agency to participating families, including assessment, information,
referrals, and assistance in the preparation and implementation of a family stabilization plan under
subdivision 5.
    (c) "Family stabilization plan" means a plan developed by a case manager and the participant,
which identifies the participant's most appropriate path to unsubsidized employment, family
stability, and barrier reduction, taking into account the family's circumstances.
   (d) "Family stabilization services" means programs, activities, and services in this section that
provide participants and their family members with assistance regarding, but not limited to:
   (1) obtaining and retaining unsubsidized employment;
   (2) family stability;
   (3) economic stability; and
   (4) barrier reduction.
   The goal of the services is to achieve the greatest degree of economic self-sufficiency and family
well-being possible for the family under the circumstances.
    Subd. 3. Eligibility. (a) The following MFIP or diversionary work program (DWP) participants
are eligible for the services under this section:
    (1) a participant who meets the requirements for or has been granted a hardship extension under

insurance; and
   (3) a participant who is a noncitizen who has been in the United States for 12 or fewer months.
   (b) Families must meet all other eligibility requirements for MFIP established in this chapter.
Families are eligible for financial assistance to the same extent as if they were participating in MFIP.
   (c) A participant under paragraph (a), clause (5), must be provided with English as a second
language opportunities and skills training for up to 12 months. After 12 months, the case manager
and participant must determine whether the participant should continue with English as a second
language classes or skills training, or both, or if the participant should become an MFIP participant.
    Subd. 4. Universal participation. All caregivers must participate in family stabilization services
as defined in subdivision 2.
   Subd. 5. Case management; family stabilization plans; coordinated services. (a) The
county agency or employment services provider shall provide family stabilization services to
families through a case management model. A case manager shall be assigned to each participating
family within 30 days after the family begins to receive financial assistance as a participant of the
family stabilization services. The case manager, with the full involvement of the participant, shall
recommend, and the county agency shall establish and modify as necessary, a family stabilization
plan for each participating family. If a participant is already assigned to a county case manager or
a county-designated case manager in social services, disability services, or housing services that
case manager already assigned may be the case manager for purposes of these services.
   (b) The family stabilization plan must include:
   (1) each participant's plan for long-term self-sufficiency, including an employment goal where
applicable;
    (2) an assessment of each participant's strengths and barriers, and any special circumstances of
the participant's family that impact, or are likely to impact, the participant's progress towards the
goals in the plan; and
    (3) an identification of the services, supports, education, training, and accommodations needed
to reduce or overcome any barriers to enable the family to achieve self-sufficiency and to fulfill each
caregiver's personal and family responsibilities.
    (c) The case manager and the participant shall meet within 30 days of the family's referral to
the case manager. The initial family stabilization plan must be completed within 30 days of the first
meeting with the case manager. The case manager shall establish a schedule for periodic review
of the family stabilization plan that includes personal contact with the participant at least once per
month. In addition, the case manager shall review and, if necessary, modify the plan under the
following circumstances:
   (1) there is a lack of satisfactory progress in achieving the goals of the plan;
   (2) the participant has lost unsubsidized or subsidized employment;
   (3) a family member has failed or is unable to comply with a family stabilization plan
requirement;
3352                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

   (4) services, supports, or other activities required by the plan are unavailable;
   (5) changes to the plan are needed to promote the well-being of the children; or
   (6) the participant and case manager determine that the plan is no longer appropriate for any
other reason.
   Subd. 6. Cooperation with services requirements. (a) To be eligible, a participant shall comply
with paragraphs (b) to (d).
    (b) Participants shall engage in family stabilization plan services for the appropriate number of
hours per week that the activities are scheduled and available, unless good cause exists for not doing
so, as defined in section 256J.57, subdivision 1. The appropriate number of hours must be based on
the participant's plan.
    (c) The case manager shall review the participant's progress toward the goals in the family
stabilization plan every six months to determine whether conditions have changed, including
whether revisions to the plan are needed.
    (d) A participant's requirement to comply with any or all family stabilization plan requirements
under this subdivision is excused when the case management services, training and educational
services, and family support services identified in the participant's family stabilization plan are
unavailable for reasons beyond the control of the participant, including when money appropriated
is not sufficient to provide the services.
    Subd. 7. Sanctions. (a) The financial assistance grant of a participating family is reduced
according to section 256J.46, if a participating adult fails without good cause to comply or continue
to comply with the family stabilization plan requirements in this subdivision, unless compliance
has been excused under subdivision 6, paragraph (e).
    (b) Given the purpose of the family stabilization services in this section and the nature of the
underlying family circumstances that act as barriers to both employment and full compliance with
program requirements, sanctions are appropriate only when it is clear that there is both the ability
to comply and willful noncompliance by the participant, as confirmed by a behavioral health or
medical professional.
   (c) Prior to the imposition of a sanction, the county agency or employment services provider
shall review the participant's case to determine if the family stabilization plan is still appropriate
and meet with the participant face-to-face. The participant may bring an advocate to the face-to-face
meeting.
   During the face-to-face meeting, the county agency shall:
   (1) determine whether the continued noncompliance can be explained and mitigated by
providing a needed family stabilization service, as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
    (2) determine whether the participant qualifies for a good cause exception under section 256J.57,
or if the sanction is for noncooperation with child support requirements, determine if the participant
qualifies for a good cause exemption under section 256.741, subdivision 10;
   (3) determine whether activities in the family stabilization plan are appropriate based on the
family's circumstances;

   (4) explain the consequences of continuing noncompliance;
   (5) identify other resources that may be available to the participant to meet the needs of the
family; and
   (6) inform the participant of the right to appeal under section 256J.40.
   If the lack of an identified activity or service can explain the noncompliance, the county shall
work with the participant to provide the identified activity.
   (d) If the participant fails to come to the face-to-face meeting, the case manager or a designee
shall attempt at least one home visit. If a face-to-face meeting is not conducted, the county agency
shall send the participant a written notice that includes the information under paragraph (c).
    (e) After the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) are met and prior to imposition of a sanction,
the county agency shall provide a notice of intent to sanction under section 256J.57, subdivision 2,
and, when applicable, a notice of adverse action under section 256J.31.
   (f) Section 256J.57 applies to this section except to the extent that it is modified by this
subdivision.
    Subd. 8. Funding. (a) The commissioner of human services shall treat MFIP expenditures made
to or on behalf of any minor child under this section, who is part of a household that meets criteria
in subdivision 3, as expenditures under a separately funded state program. These expenditures shall
not count toward the state's maintenance of effort requirements under the federal TANF program.
    (b) A family is no longer part of a separately funded program under this section if the caregiver
no longer meets the criteria for family stabilization services in subdivision 3, or if it is determined
at recertification that the caregiver is meeting the federal work participation rate, whichever occurs
sooner.
   Sec. 42. [256J.621] WORK PARTICIPATION BONUS.
    (a) Upon exiting the diversionary work program (DWP) or upon terminating MFIP cash
assistance with earnings, a participant who is employed may be eligible for transitional assistance
of $100 per month to assist in meeting the family's basic needs as the participant continues to move
toward self-sufficiency.
    (b) To be eligible for a transitional assistance payment, the participant shall not receive MFIP
cash assistance or diversionary work program assistance during the month and the participant or
participants must meet the following work requirements:
  (1) if the participant is a single caregiver and has a child under six years of age, the participant
must be employed at least 87 hours per month;
    (2) if the participant is a single caregiver and does not have a child under six years of age, the
participant must be employed at least 130 hours per month; or
   (3) if the household is a two-parent family, at least one of the parents must be employed an
average of at least 130 hours per month.

consecutive months.
    (c) Expenditures on the program are maintenance of effort state funds for participants under
paragraph (b), clauses (1) and (2). Expenditures for participants under paragraph (b), clause (3),

performance. Projects shall be targeted to geographic areas with poor outcomes as specified in
section 256J.751, subdivision 5, or to subgroups within the MFIP case load who are experiencing
poor outcomes. For purposes of an incentive, a county or tribe exceeds performance if the county
or tribe is above the top of the county or tribe's annualized range of expected performance on the

to meet the performance standards specified in title 1 of Public Law 104-193 of the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and under Public Law 109-171, the Deficit
Reduction Act of 2005, the state shall pay 88 percent of the sanction. The remaining 12 percent
of the sanction will be paid by the counties. The county portion of the sanction will be distributed
across all counties in proportion to each county's percentage of the MFIP average monthly caseload
during the period for which the sanction was applied.
    (b) If a county fails to meet the performance standards specified in title 1 of Public Law 104-193
of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and Public Law 109-171, the
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, for any year, the commissioner shall work with counties to organize
a joint state-county technical assistance team to work with the county. The commissioner shall
coordinate any technical assistance with other departments and agencies including the Departments
of Employment and Economic Development and Education as necessary to achieve the purpose of
this paragraph.
    (c) For state performance measures, a low-performing county is one that:
     (1) performs below the bottom of their expected range for the measure in subdivision 2, clause
­

the four quarterly measurements for the year, or the ten counties with the lowest rates if more than
ten are below 40 percent.

program. Family units that are not eligible for the diversionary work program include:
   (1) child only cases;
    (2) a single-parent family unit that includes a child under 12 weeks of age. A parent is eligible

   (3) a minor parent without a high school diploma or its equivalent;
    (4) an 18- or 19-year-old caregiver without a high school diploma or its equivalent who chooses
to have an employment plan with an education option;
   (5) a caregiver age 60 or over;
    (6) family units with a caregiver who received DWP benefits in the 12 months prior to the month
the family applied for DWP, except as provided in paragraph (c);

    (10) refugees as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 45, chapter IV, section 444.43,
who arrived in the United States in the 12 months prior to the date of application for family cash
assistance.
    (b) A two-parent family must participate in DWP unless both caregivers meet the criteria for
an exception under paragraph (a), clauses (1) through (5), or the family unit includes a parent who
meets the criteria in paragraph (a), clause (6), (7), (8), or (9).
    (c) Once DWP eligibility is determined, the four months run consecutively. If a participant leaves
the program for any reason and reapplies during the four-month period, the county must redetermine
eligibility for DWP.

homeless youth programs receiving funding under this section. Funding shall be directed to meet
the greatest need, with a significant share of the funding focused on homeless youth providers in
greater Minnesota.
     Sec. 54. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.67, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility conditions. (a) The placing agency shall use the AFDC requirements as
specified in federal law as of July 16, 1996, when determining the child's eligibility for adoption
assistance under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. If the child does not qualify, the placing agency
shall certify a child as eligible for state funded adoption assistance only if the following criteria are
met:
    (1) Due to the child's characteristics or circumstances it would be difficult to provide the child
an adoptive home without adoption assistance.
   (2)(i) A placement agency has made reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption without
adoption assistance, but has been unsuccessful; or
   (ii) the child's licensed foster parents desire to adopt the child and it is determined by the placing
agency that the adoption is in the best interest of the child.
    (3)(i) The child has been a ward of the commissioner, a Minnesota-licensed child-placing
agency, or a tribal social service agency of Minnesota recognized by the Secretary of the Interior;
or (ii) the child will be adopted according to tribal law without a termination of parental rights or
relinquishment, provided that the tribe has documented the valid reason why the child cannot or
should not be returned to the home of the child's parent. The placing agency shall not certify a
child who remains under the jurisdiction of the sending agency pursuant to section 260.851, article
5, for state-funded adoption assistance when Minnesota is the receiving state.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, the characteristics or circumstances that may be considered
in determining whether a child is a child with special needs under United States Code, title 42,
chapter 7, subchapter IV, part E, or meets the requirements of paragraph (a), clause (1), are the
following:
    (1) The child is a member of a sibling group to be placed as one unit in which at least one sibling
is older than 15 months of age or is described in clause (2) or (3).
     (2) The child has documented physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disabilities.
     (3) The child has a high risk of developing physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disabilities.

care providers.
   Sec. 61. SCHOOL READINESS SERVICE AGREEMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Overview. (a) Effective July 1, 2007, funds must be made available to allow
the commissioner to pay higher rates to up to 50 child care providers who are deemed by the
commissioner to meet the requirements of a school readiness service agreement (SRSA) provider
and perform services that support school readiness for children and economic stability for parents.
The commissioner shall annually earmark a proportionate amount of the funds under this section
for family child care providers meeting the requirements under subdivision 2. If, after a reasonable
amount of time to allow family child care providers to enter into agreements under this section, the
earmarked funds have not been disbursed, the commissioner may make the funds available to other
eligible providers.
   (b) A provider may be paid a rate above that currently allowed under Minnesota Statutes, section
119B.13, if:
   (1) the provider has entered into an SRSA with the commissioner;
    (2) a family using that provider receives child care assistance under any provision in Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 119B, except Minnesota Statutes, section 119B.035;
   (3) the family using that provider meets the criteria in this section; and
   (4) funding is available under this section.

    (4) serve at least one child who is subsidized through the child care assistance program and who
is expected to enter kindergarten within the following 30 months.
   (b) The commissioner may waive the 25 percent requirement in paragraph (a), clause (2), if
necessary to achieve geographic distribution of SRSA providers and diversity of types of care
provided by SRSA providers.
   (c) An eligible provider who would like to enter into an SRSA with the commissioner shall
submit an SRSA application. To determine whether to enter into an SRSA with a provider, the
commissioner shall evaluate the following factors:
   (1) the qualifications of the provider and the provider's staff;
   (2) the provider's staff-child ratios;
   (3) the provider's curriculum;
   (4) the provider's current or planned parent education activities;
   (5) the provider's current or planned social service and employment linkages;
   (6) the provider's child development assessment plan;
   (7) the geographic distribution needed for SRSA providers;
   (8) the inclusion of a variety of child care delivery models; and
   (9) other related factors determined by the commissioner.
    Subd. 3. Family and child eligibility. (a) A family eligible to choose an SRSA provider for their
children shall:
   (1) be eligible to receive child care assistance under any provision in Minnesota Statutes, chapter
119B, except Minnesota Statutes, section 119B.035;
    (2) be in an authorized activity for an average of at least 35 hours per week when initial eligibility
is determined; and
   (3) include a child who has not yet entered kindergarten.
    (b) A family who is determined to be eligible to choose an SRSA provider remains eligible to
be paid at a higher rate through the SRSA provider when the following conditions exist:
   (1) the child attends child care with the SRSA provider a minimum of 25 hours per week, on
average;
   (2) the family has a child who has not yet entered kindergarten; and
    (3) the family maintains eligibility under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 119B, except Minnesota
Statutes, section 119B.035.
    (c) For the 12 months after initial eligibility has been determined, a decrease in the family's
authorized activities to an average of less than 35 hours per week does not result in ineligibility for
the SRSA rate.
3368                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

   (d) A family that moves between counties but continues to use the same SRSA provider shall
continue to receive SRSA funding for the increased payments.
    Subd. 4. Requirements of providers. An SRSA must include assessment, evaluation, and
reporting requirements that promote the goals of improved school readiness and movement toward
appropriate child development milestones. A provider who enters into an SRSA shall comply with
the assessment, evaluation, and reporting requirements in the SRSA.
   Subd. 5. Relationship to current law. (a) The following provisions in Minnesota Statutes,
chapter 119B, must be waived or modified for families receiving services under this section.
   (b) Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 119B.13, subdivisions 1 and 1a, maximum
weekly rates under this section are 125 percent of the existing maximum weekly rate for like-care.
Providers eligible for a differential rate under Minnesota Statutes, section 119B.13, subdivision 3a,
remain eligible for the differential above the rate identified in this section. Only care for children
who have not yet entered kindergarten may be paid at the maximum rate under this section. The
provider's charge for service provided through an SRSA may not exceed the rate that the provider
charges a private-pay family for like-care arrangements.
    (c) A family or child care provider may not be assessed an overpayment for care provided
through an SRSA unless:
   (1) there was an error in the amount of care authorized for the family; or
   (2) the family or provider did not timely report a change as required under the law.
   (d) Care provided through an SRSA is authorized on a weekly basis.
    (e) Funds appropriated under this section to serve families eligible under Minnesota Statutes,
section 119B.03, are not allocated through the basic sliding fee formula under Minnesota Statutes,
section 119B.03. Funds appropriated under this section are used to offset increased costs when
payments are made under SRSA's.
    (f) Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 119B.09, subdivision 6, the maximum amount
of child care assistance that may be authorized for a child receiving care through an SRSA in a
two-week period is 160 hours per child.
    Subd. 6. Establishment of service agreements. (a) The commissioner shall approve SRSA's
for up to 50 providers that represent diverse parts of the state and a variety of child care delivery
models. Entering into a service agreement does not guarantee that a provider will receive payment
at a higher rate for families receiving child care assistance. A family eligible under this section shall
choose a provider participating in an SRSA in order for a higher rate to be paid. Payments through
SRSA's are also limited by the availability of SRSA funds.
    (b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit parent choice as defined in Minnesota
Statutes, section 119B.09, subdivision 5.
   (c) The commissioner may allow for startup time for some providers if failing to do so would
limit geographic diversity of SRSA providers or a variety of child care delivery models.

The study must include:
   (1) the likelihood of there being sufficient child care providers meeting the standards;
   (2) the cost to bring providers up to the standards and how this cost would be funded;
   (3) how the standards and the ratings would be communicated to both parents and the general
public; and
   (4) a determination whether a similar system could be implemented for non-center-based care.

of the original report. An update to a study and report not originally completed under this section
must ensure that the study and report, as updated, meet the requirements of this section. An adoption
study is valid if the report has been completed or updated within the previous 12 months.
      Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.53, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Adoption agencies; postplacement assessment and report. (a) The agency to which
the petition has been referred under subdivision 1 shall conduct a postplacement assessment and
file a report with the court within 90 days of receipt of a copy of the adoption petition. The agency
shall send a copy of the report to the commissioner at the time it files the report with the court. The
assessment and report must evaluate the environment and antecedents of the child to be adopted,
the home of the petitioners, whether placement with the petitioners meets the needs of the child as
described in section 259.57, subdivision 2. The report must include a recommendation to the court
as to whether the petition should or should not be granted.
   In making evaluations and recommendations, the postplacement assessment and report must, at
a minimum, address the following:
      (1) the level of adaptation by the prospective adoptive parents to parenting the child;
      (2) the health and well-being of the child in the prospective adoptive parents' home;
   (3) the level of incorporation by the child into the prospective adoptive parents' home, extended
family, and community; and
    (4) the level of inclusion of the child's previous history into the prospective adoptive home, such
as cultural or ethnic practices, or contact with former foster parents or biological relatives.
      (b) A postplacement adoption report is valid for 12 months following its date of completion.

provisions of this paragraph apply. Unless the assessment and report were completed by the local
social services agency, the agency completing the report, at the time it files the report with the court
under paragraph (a), must provide a copy of the report to the local social services agency in the
county where the prospective adoptive parent lives. The agency or local social services agency may
recommend that the court dismiss the petition. If the local social services agency determines that
continued placement in the home endangers the child's physical or emotional health, the agency
shall seek a court order to remove the child from the home.

subdivision 1, paragraph (b), fails to complete the assessment and file the report within 90 days of
the date it received a copy of the adoption petition, the court may hear the petition upon giving the
agency and the local social services agency, if different, five days' notice by mail of the time and
place of the hearing.

   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.57, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Protection of child's best interests. (a) The policy of the state of Minnesota is to ensure
that the best interests of children are met by requiring an individualized determination of the needs
of the child and how the adoptive placement will serve the needs of the child.
    (b) Among the factors the court shall consider in determining the needs of the child are those
specified under section 260C.193, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). Consistent with section 245C.33 and
Public Law 109-248, a complete background study is required before the approval of an adoptive
placement in a home.
    (c) In reviewing adoptive placement and in determining appropriate adoption, the court shall
consider placement, consistent with the child's best interests and in the following order, with (1)
a relative or relatives of the child, or (2) an important friend with whom the child has resided or
had significant contact. Placement of a child cannot be delayed or denied based on race, color, or
national origin of the adoptive parent or the child. Whenever possible, siblings should be placed
together unless it is determined not to be in the best interests of a sibling.
    (d) If the child's birth parent or parents explicitly request that relatives and important friends not
be considered, the court shall honor that request consistent with the best interests of the child.
   If the child's birth parent or parents express a preference for placing the child in an adoptive
home of the same or a similar religious background to that of the birth parent or parents, the court
shall place the child with a family that also meets the birth parent's religious preference. Only if
no family is available as described in clause (a) or (b) may the court give preference to a family
described in clause (c) that meets the parent's religious preference.
    (e) This subdivision does not affect the Indian Child Welfare Act, United States Code, title
25, sections 1901 to 1923, and the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act, sections 260.751 to
260.835.

safety, or welfare;

2; or
    (iii) the agency or the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe the relative or household
member over the age of 13 has a criminal history which would not make transfer of permanent
legal and physical custody to the relative under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, in the child's best
interest; and
    (3) a parent, following an out-of-home placement, when the responsible social services agency
has reasonable cause to believe that the parent has been convicted of a crime directly related to
the parent's capacity to maintain the child's health, safety, or welfare or the parent is the subject
of an open investigation of, or has been the subject of a substantiated allegation of, child or
vulnerable-adult maltreatment within the past ten years.
"Reasonable cause" means that the agency has received information or a report from the subject or
a third person that creates an articulable suspicion that the individual has a history that may pose
a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the child. The information or report must be specific to
the potential subject of the background check and shall not be based on the race, religion, ethnic
background, age, class, or lifestyle of the potential subject.

      Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260C.212, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Placement decisions based on best interest of the child. (a) The policy of the state
of Minnesota is to ensure that the child's best interests are met by requiring an individualized
determination of the needs of the child and of how the selected placement will serve the needs
of the child being placed. The authorized child-placing agency shall place a child, released by
court order or by voluntary release by the parent or parents, in a family foster home selected by
considering placement with relatives and important friends in the following order:
      (1) with an individual who is related to the child by blood, marriage, or adoption; or
    (2) with an individual who is an important friend with whom the child has resided or had
significant contact.
    (b) Among the factors the agency shall consider in determining the needs of the child are the
following:
      (1) the child's current functioning and behaviors;
      (2) the medical, educational, and developmental needs of the child;
      (3) the child's history and past experience;
      (4) the child's religious and cultural needs;
      (5) the child's connection with a community, school, and church;
      (6) the child's interests and talents;
      (7) the child's relationship to current caretakers, parents, siblings, and relatives; and
63RD DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3391

   (8) the reasonable preference of the child, if the court, or the child-placing agency in the case of
a voluntary placement, deems the child to be of sufficient age to express preferences.
    (c) Placement of a child cannot be delayed or denied based on race, color, or national origin of
the foster parent or the child.
   (d) Siblings should be placed together for foster care and adoption at the earliest possible time
unless it is determined not to be in the best interests of a sibling or unless it is not possible after
appropriate efforts by the responsible social services agency.
    (e) Except for emergency placement as provided for in section 245A.035, a completed
background study is required under section 245C.08 before the approval of a foster placement in a
related or unrelated home.
   Sec. 31. LICENSING MORATORIUM.
    A program operated by a nonpublic school for children 33 months or older is exempt from the
human services licensing requirements in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 245A, until July 1, 2009.
Nothing in this section prohibits an already licensed nonpublic school program from continuing its
licensure or a nonpublic school program from seeking licensure.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This moratorium is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 32. ANNUAL LICENSE REVIEW.
   The commissioner of human services shall work with counties to determine the cost and propose

   Sec. 3. [256.963] PRIMARY CARE ACCESS INITIATIVE.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. (a) The commissioner shall award a grant to implement in
Hennepin and Ramsey Counties a Web-based primary care access pilot project designed as a
collaboration between private and public sectors to connect, where appropriate, a patient with a
primary care medical home, and schedule patients into available community-based appointments
as an alternative to nonemergency use of the hospital emergency room. The grantee must establish
a program that diverts patients presenting at an emergency room for nonemergency care to more
appropriate outpatient settings. The program must refer the patient to an appropriate health care
professional based on the patient's health care needs and situation. The program must provide
the patient with a scheduled appointment that is timely, with an appropriate provider who is
conveniently located. If the patient is uninsured and potentially eligible for a Minnesota health
care program, the program must connect the patient to a primary care provider, community clinic,
or agency that can assist the patient with the application process. The program must also ensure
that discharged patients are connected with a community-based primary care provider and assist in
scheduling any necessary follow-up visits before the patient is discharged.
    (b) The program must not require a provider to pay a fee for accepting charity care patients or
patients enrolled in a Minnesota public health care program.
   Subd. 2. Evaluation. (a) The grantee must report to the commissioner on a quarterly basis the
3398                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

following information:
   (1) the total number of appointments available for scheduling by specialty;
   (2) the average length of time between scheduling and actual appointment;
   (3) the total number of patients referred and whether the patient was insured or uninsured; and
   (4) the total number of appointments resulting in visits completed and number of patients
continuing services with the referring clinic.
    (b) The commissioner, in consultation with the Minnesota Hospital Association, shall conduct
an evaluation of the emergency room diversion pilot project and submit the results to the legislature
by January 15, 2009. The evaluation shall compare the number of nonemergency visits and repeat
visits to hospital emergency rooms for the period before the commencement of the project and one
year after the commencement, and an estimate of the costs saved from any documented reductions.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.969, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Payments. (a) Acute care hospital billings under the medical assistance program
must not be submitted until the recipient is discharged. However, the commissioner shall establish
monthly interim payments for inpatient hospitals that have individual patient lengths of stay
over 30 days regardless of diagnostic category. Except as provided in section 256.9693, medical
assistance reimbursement for treatment of mental illness shall be reimbursed based on diagnostic
classifications. Individual hospital payments established under this section and sections 256.9685,
256.9686, and 256.9695, in addition to third party and recipient liability, for discharges occurring
during the rate year shall not exceed, in aggregate, the charges for the medical assistance covered
inpatient services paid for the same period of time to the hospital. This payment limitation shall
be calculated separately for medical assistance and general assistance medical care services. The
limitation on general assistance medical care shall be effective for admissions occurring on or
after July 1, 1991. Services that have rates established under subdivision 11 or 12, must be limited
separately from other services. After consulting with the affected hospitals, the commissioner may
consider related hospitals one entity and may merge the payment rates while maintaining separate
provider numbers. The operating and property base rates per admission or per day shall be derived
from the best Medicare and claims data available when rates are established. The commissioner
shall determine the best Medicare and claims data, taking into consideration variables of recency
of the data, audit disposition, settlement status, and the ability to set rates in a timely manner. The
commissioner shall notify hospitals of payment rates by December 1 of the year preceding the
rate year. The rate setting data must reflect the admissions data used to establish relative values.
Base year changes from 1981 to the base year established for the rate year beginning January 1,
1991, and for subsequent rate years, shall not be limited to the limits ending June 30, 1987, on
the maximum rate of increase under subdivision 1. The commissioner may adjust base year cost,
relative value, and case mix index data to exclude the costs of services that have been discontinued
by the October 1 of the year preceding the rate year or that are paid separately from inpatient
services. Inpatient stays that encompass portions of two or more rate years shall have payments
established based on payment rates in effect at the time of admission unless the date of admission
preceded the rate year in effect by six months or more. In this case, operating payment rates for
services rendered during the rate year in effect and established based on the date of admission shall
be adjusted to the rate year in effect by the hospital cost index.

    (b) For fee-for-service admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for inpatient services is reduced by .5 percent
from the current statutory rates.
    (c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service admissions
occurring on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for inpatient services before third-party liability
and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services
within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432, ­  an

for admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2007, a long-term hospital as designated by the Medicare
program that is located in a city of the first class as defined in section 410.01, are excluded from this
paragraph.
    (d) In addition to the reduction in paragraphs (b) and (c), the total payment for fee-for-service
admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2005, made to hospitals for inpatient services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced 6.0 percent from the current statutory rates. Mental
health services within diagnosis related groups 424 to 432 ­an

16, and, effective for admissions occurring on or after July 1, 2007, a long-term hospital as
designated by the Medicare program that is located in a city of the first class as defined in section
410.01, are excluded from this paragraph. Notwithstanding section 256.9686, subdivision 7, for
purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include general assistance medical care.
Payments made to managed care plans shall be reduced for services provided on or after January
1, 2006, to reflect this reduction.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.969, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Disproportionate numbers of low-income patients served. (a) For admissions
occurring on or after October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992, the medical assistance
disproportionate population adjustment shall comply with federal law and shall be paid to a
hospital, excluding regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service,
with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate in excess of the arithmetic mean. The adjustment
must be determined as follows:
    (1) for a hospital with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate above the arithmetic mean for
all hospitals excluding regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service
but less than or equal to one standard deviation above the mean, the adjustment must be determined
by multiplying the total of the operating and property payment rates by the difference between the
hospital's actual medical assistance inpatient utilization rate and the arithmetic mean for all hospitals
excluding regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service; and
    (2) for a hospital with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate above one standard
deviation above the mean, the adjustment must be determined by multiplying the adjustment that
would be determined under clause (1) for that hospital by 1.1. If federal matching funds are not
available for all adjustments under this subdivision, the commissioner shall reduce payments on a
pro rata basis so that all adjustments qualify for federal match. The commissioner may establish
a separate disproportionate population operating payment rate adjustment under the general
assistance medical care program. For purposes of this subdivision medical assistance does not
include general assistance medical care. The commissioner shall report annually on the number of
hospitals likely to receive the adjustment authorized by this paragraph. The commissioner shall
specifically report on the adjustments received by public hospitals and public hospital corporations

population adjustment shall comply with federal law and shall be paid to a hospital, excluding
regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service, with a medical
assistance inpatient utilization rate in excess of the arithmetic mean. The adjustment must be
determined as follows:

all hospitals excluding regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service
but less than or equal to one standard deviation above the mean, the adjustment must be determined
by multiplying the total of the operating and property payment rates by the difference between the
hospital's actual medical assistance inpatient utilization rate and the arithmetic mean for all hospitals
excluding regional treatment centers and facilities of the federal Indian Health Service;

deviation above the mean, the adjustment must be determined by multiplying the adjustment that
would be determined under clause (1) for that hospital by 1.1. The commissioner may establish

hospitals likely to receive the adjustment authorized by this paragraph. The commissioner shall
specifically report on the adjustments received by public hospitals and public hospital corporations
located in cities of the first class;
    (3) for a hospital that had medical assistance fee-for-service payment volume during calendar
year 1991 in excess of 13 percent of total medical assistance fee-for-service payment volume, a
medical assistance disproportionate population adjustment shall be paid in addition to any other
disproportionate payment due under this subdivision as follows: $1,515,000 due on the 15th
of each month after noon, beginning July 15, 1995. For a hospital that had medical assistance
fee-for-service payment volume during calendar year 1991 in excess of eight percent of total
medical assistance fee-for-service payment volume and was the primary hospital affiliated with the
University of Minnesota, a medical assistance disproportionate population adjustment shall be paid
in addition to any other disproportionate payment due under this subdivision as follows: $505,000
due on the 15th of each month after noon, beginning July 15, 1995; and
    (4) effective August 1, 2005, the payments in paragraph (b), clause (3), shall be reduced to zero.
    (c) The commissioner shall adjust rates paid to a health maintenance organization under contract
with the commissioner to reflect rate increases provided in paragraph (b), clauses (1) and (2), on a
nondiscounted hospital-specific basis but shall not adjust those rates to reflect payments provided
in clause (3).
    (d) If federal matching funds are not available for all adjustments under paragraph (b), the
commissioner shall reduce payments under paragraph (b), clauses (1) and (2), on a pro rata basis so
that all adjustments under paragraph (b) qualify for federal match.
  (e) For purposes of this subdivision, medical assistance does not include general assistance
medical care.

   (1) for a hospital located in Minnesota and not eligible for payments under subdivision 20, with
a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate greater than 17.8 percent of total patient days as of the
base year in effect on July 1, 2005, a payment equal to 13 percent of the total of the operating and

commissioner shall ratably reduce or increase payments under this subdivision in order to ensure
that these payments equal the amount of reimbursement received by the commissioner under
section 256B.199, except that payments shall be ratably reduced by an amount equivalent to the
state share of a four percent reduction in MinnesotaCare and medical assistance payments for
inpatient hospital services. Effective July 1, 2009, the ratable reduction shall be equivalent to the
state share of a three percent reduction in these payments.
   (c) The payments under paragraph (a) shall be paid quarterly based on each hospital's operating
and property payments from the second previous quarter, beginning on July 15, 2007, or upon federal
approval of federal reimbursements under section 256B.199, whichever occurs later.
   (d) The commissioner shall not adjust rates paid to a prepaid health plan under contract with the
commissioner to reflect payments provided in paragraph (a).
    (e) The commissioner shall maximize the use of available federal money for disproportionate
share hospital payments and shall maximize payments to qualifying hospitals. In order to
accomplish these purposes, the commissioner may, in consultation with the nonstate entities
identified in section 256B.199, adjust, on a pro rata basis if feasible, the amounts reported by
nonstate entities under section 256B.199 when application for reimbursement is made to the federal
government, and otherwise adjust the provisions of this subdivision. The commissioner shall
utilize a settlement process based on finalized data to maximize revenue under section 256B.199
and payments under this section.
    (f) By January 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2006, the commissioner shall report to the
chairs of the house and senate finance committees and divisions with jurisdiction over funding for
the Department of Human Services the following estimates for the current and upcoming federal
and state fiscal years:
    (1) the difference between the Medicare upper payment limit and actual or anticipated medical
assistance payments for hospital services;
  (2) the amount of federal disproportionate share hospital funding available to Minnesota and the
amount expected to be claimed by the state; and
   (3) the methodology used to calculate the results reported for clauses (1) and (2).

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.969, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 28. Long-term hospital payment adjustment. For admissions occurring on or after July
1, 2007, the commissioner shall increase the medical assistance payments to a long-term hospital
with a medical assistance inpatient utilization rate of 17.95 percent of total patient days as of the
base year in effect on July 1, 2005, by an amount equal to 13 percent of the total of the operating
and property payment rates. Payments made to managed care plans shall not reflect this payment
increase. For purposes of this subdivision, medical assistance does not include general assistance
medical care. Payments to a hospital under this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of any
payments made under subdivision 27.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.04, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Competitive bidding. (a) When determined to be effective, economical, and feasible,
the commissioner may utilize volume purchase through competitive bidding and negotiation under
the provisions of chapter 16C, to provide items under the medical assistance program including but
not limited to the following:
    (1) eyeglasses;
   (2) oxygen. The commissioner shall provide for oxygen needed in an emergency situation on a
short-term basis, until the vendor can obtain the necessary supply from the contract dealer;
    (3) hearing aids and supplies; and
    (4) durable medical equipment, including but not limited to:
    (i) hospital beds;
    (ii) commodes;
    (iii) glide-about chairs;
    (iv) patient lift apparatus;
    (v) wheelchairs and accessories;

   (b) Rate changes under this chapter and chapters 256D and 256L do not affect contract payments
under this subdivision unless specifically identified.
   (c) The commissioner may not utilize volume purchase through competitive bidding and
negotiation for special transportation services under the provisions of chapter 16C.
      Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14a. Level of need determination. Nonemergency medical transportation level of
need determinations must be performed by a physician, a registered nurse working under direct
supervision of a physician, a physician's assistant, a nurse practitioner, a licensed practical nurse,
or a discharge planner. Nonemergency medical transportation level of need determinations must
not be performed more than semiannually on any individual, unless the individual's circumstances
have sufficiently changed so as to require a new level of need determination. Individuals residing
in licensed nursing facilities are exempt from a level of need determination and are eligible for
special transportation services until the individual no longer resides in a licensed nursing facility.
If a person authorized by this subdivision to perform a level of need determination determines that
an individual requires stretcher transportation, the individual is presumed to maintain that level of
need until otherwise determined by a person authorized to perform a level of need determination,
or for six months, whichever is sooner.
      Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.056, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Eligibility verification. (a) The commissioner shall require women who are applying
for the continuation of medical assistance coverage following the end of the 60-day postpartum
period to update their income and asset information and to submit any required income or asset
verification.
    (b) The commissioner shall determine the eligibility of private-sector health care coverage for
infants less than one year of age eligible under section 256B.055, subdivision 10, or 256B.057,
subdivision 1, paragraph (d), and shall pay for private-sector coverage if this is determined to be
cost-effective.

to exclude as participating providers in the program or programs under their jurisdiction those
providers who do not participate in the medical assistance program. The commissioner of employee
relations shall implement this section through contracts with participating health and dental carriers.

    Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.75, is amended to read:
    256B.75 HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT REIMBURSEMENT.
    (a) For outpatient hospital facility fee payments for services rendered on or after October 1,
1992, the commissioner of human services shall pay the lower of (1) submitted charge, or (2) 32
percent above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992, except for those services for which there is a
federal maximum allowable payment. Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000,
payment rates for nonsurgical outpatient hospital facility fees and emergency room facility fees shall
be increased by eight percent over the rates in effect on December 31, 1999, except for those services
for which there is a federal maximum allowable payment. Services for which there is a federal
maximum allowable payment shall be paid at the lower of (1) submitted charge, or (2) the federal
maximum allowable payment. Total aggregate payment for outpatient hospital facility fee services
shall not exceed the Medicare upper limit. If it is determined that a provision of this section conflicts
with existing or future requirements of the United States government with respect to federal financial
participation in medical assistance, the federal requirements prevail. The commissioner may, in
the aggregate, prospectively reduce payment rates to avoid reduced federal financial participation
resulting from rates that are in excess of the Medicare upper limitations.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), payment for outpatient, emergency, and ambulatory surgery

                     e services for critical access hospitals designated under section 144.1483, clause
(10), shall be paid on a cost-based payment system that is based on the cost-finding methods and
allowable costs of the Medicare program. Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2007, a
children's hospital that was formerly a state hospital must be paid for the services in this paragraph
using the methodology established for critical access hospitals at a rate equal to 71 percent of
allowable costs.
    (c) Effective for services provided on or after July 1, 2003, rates that are based on the Medicare
outpatient prospective payment system shall be replaced by a budget neutral prospective payment
system that is derived using medical assistance data. The commissioner shall provide a proposal to
the 2003 legislature to define and implement this provision.
    (d) For fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before
third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services is

reduced by .5 percent from the current statutory rate.
    (e) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (d), the total payment for fee-for-service services
provided on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services before
third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Facilities
defined under section 256.969, subdivision 16, are excluded from this paragraph.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.76, is amended to read:
   256B.76 PHYSICIAN AND DENTAL REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a) Effective for services rendered on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall make
payments for physician services as follows:
    (1) payment for level one Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' common procedural
coding system codes titled "office and other outpatient services," "preventive medicine new and
established patient," "delivery, antepartum, and postpartum care," "critical care," cesarean delivery
and pharmacologic management provided to psychiatric patients, and level three codes for enhanced
services for prenatal high risk, shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 25 percent
above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992. If the rate on any procedure code within these categories
is different than the rate that would have been paid under the methodology in section 256B.74,
subdivision 2, then the larger rate shall be paid;
   (2) payments for all other services shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 15.4
percent above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992;
    (3) all physician rates shall be converted from the 50th percentile of 1982 to the 50th percentile
of 1989, less the percent in aggregate necessary to equal the above increases except that payment
rates for home health agency services shall be the rates in effect on September 30, 1992;
   (4) effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000, payment rates for physician and
professional services shall be increased by three percent over the rates in effect on December 31,
1999, except for home health agency and family planning agency services; and
   (5) the increases in clause (4) shall be implemented January 1, 2000, for managed care.
   (b) Effective for services rendered on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall make
payments for dental services as follows:
    (1) dental services shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 25 percent above
the rate in effect on June 30, 1992;
   (2) dental rates shall be converted from the 50th percentile of 1982 to the 50th percentile of
1989, less the percent in aggregate necessary to equal the above increases;
   (3) effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000, payment rates for dental services
shall be increased by three percent over the rates in effect on December 31, 1999;
   (4) the commissioner shall award grants to community clinics or other nonprofit community
organizations, political subdivisions, professional associations, or other organizations that
demonstrate the ability to provide dental services effectively to public program recipients. Grants
may be used to fund the costs related to coordinating access for recipients, developing and

implementing patient care criteria, upgrading or establishing new facilities, acquiring furnishings
or equipment, recruiting new providers, or other development costs that will improve access to
dental care in a region. In awarding grants, the commissioner shall give priority to applicants that
plan to serve areas of the state in which the number of dental providers is not currently sufficient to
meet the needs of recipients of public programs or uninsured individuals. The commissioner shall
consider the following in awarding the grants:
     (i) potential to successfully increase access to an underserved population;
     (ii) the ability to raise matching funds;
     (iii) the long-term viability of the project to improve access beyond the period of initial funding;
     (iv) the efficiency in the use of the funding; and
     (v) the experience of the proposers in providing services to the target population.
    The commissioner shall monitor the grants and may terminate a grant if the grantee does not
increase dental access for public program recipients. The commissioner shall consider grants for
the following:
   (i) implementation of new programs or continued expansion of current access programs that
have demonstrated success in providing dental services in underserved areas;
   (ii) a pilot program for utilizing hygienists outside of a traditional dental office to provide dental
hygiene services; and
    (iii) a program that organizes a network of volunteer dentists, establishes a system to refer
eligible individuals to volunteer dentists, and through that network provides donated dental care
services to public program recipients or uninsured individuals;
    (5) beginning October 1, 1999, the payment for tooth sealants and fluoride treatments shall be
the lower of (i) submitted charge, or (ii) 80 percent of median 1997 charges;
    (6) the increases listed in clauses (3) and (5) shall be implemented January 1, 2000, for managed
care; and
   (7) effective for services provided on or after January 1, 2002, payment for diagnostic
examinations and dental x-rays provided to children under age 21 shall be the lower of (i) the
submitted charge, or (ii) 85 percent of median 1999 charges.
     (c) Effective for dental services rendered on or after January 1, 2002, the commissioner

                            t­ For dental services rendered on or after July 1, 2007, the commissioner shall
increase reimbursement by 33 percent above the reimbursement rate that would otherwise be
paid to the critical access dental provider. The commissioner shall pay the health plan companies
in amounts sufficient to reflect increased reimbursements to critical access dental providers as
approved by the commissioner. In determining which dentists and dental clinics shall be deemed
critical access dental providers, the commissioner shall review:
63RD DAY]                                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                                                 3411

   (1) the utilization rate in the service area in which the dentist or dental clinic operates for
dental services to patients covered by medical assistance, general assistance medical care, or
MinnesotaCare as their primary source of coverage;
    (2) the level of services provided by the dentist or dental clinic to patients covered by medical
assistance, general assistance medical care, or MinnesotaCare as their primary source of coverage;
and
   (3) whether the level of services provided by the dentist or dental clinic is critical to maintaining
adequate levels of patient access within the service area.
In the absence of a critical access dental provider in a service area, the commissioner may designate
a dentist or dental clinic as a critical access dental provider if the dentist or dental clinic is willing
to provide care to patients covered by medical assistance, general assistance medical care, or
MinnesotaCare at a level which significantly increases access to dental care in the service area.

    (d) An entity that operates both a Medicare certified comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation
facility and a facility which was certified prior to January 1, 1993, that is licensed under Minnesota
Rules, parts 9570.2000 to 9570.3600, and for whom at least 33 percent of the clients receiving
rehabilitation services in the most recent calendar year are medical assistance recipients, shall be
reimbursed by the commissioner for rehabilitation services at rates that are 38 percent greater than
the maximum reimbursement rate allowed under paragraph (a), clause (2), when those services are
(1) provided within the comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility and (2) provided to residents
of nursing facilities owned by the entity.
    (e) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2007, the commissioner shall
make payments for physician and professional services based on the Medicare relative value

   (2) who is a resident of Minnesota; and
    (i) who has gross countable income not in excess of 75 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
for the family size, using a six-month budget period and whose equity in assets is not in excess
of $1,000 per assistance unit. General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or
enrollees who are otherwise eligible for medical assistance but fail to verify their assets. Enrollees
who become eligible for medical assistance shall be terminated and transferred to medical assistance.
Exempt assets, the reduction of excess assets, and the waiver of excess assets must conform to the
medical assistance program in section 256B.056, subdivision 3, with the following exception: the
maximum amount of undistributed funds in a trust that could be distributed to or on behalf of the
beneficiary by the trustee, assuming the full exercise of the trustee's discretion under the terms of
the trust, must be applied toward the asset maximum;
    (ii) who has gross countable income above 75 percent of the federal poverty guidelines but not
in excess of 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the family size, using a six-month
budget period, whose equity in assets is not in excess of the limits in section 256B.056, subdivision
3c, and who applies during an inpatient hospitalization; or
    (iii) the commissioner shall adjust the income standards under this section each July 1 by
the annual update of the federal poverty guidelines following publication by the United States
Department of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general
assistance medical care may not be paid for applicants or recipients who are adults with dependent
children under 21 whose gross family income is equal to or less than 275 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines who are not described in paragraph (e).
    (c) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general
assistance medical care may be paid for applicants and recipients who meet all eligibility
requirements of paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i), for a temporary period beginning the date of
application. Immediately following approval of general assistance medical care, enrollees shall be
enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 7, with covered services as provided
in section 256L.03 for the rest of the six-month general assistance medical care eligibility period,
until their six-month renewal.
   (d) To be eligible for general assistance medical care following enrollment in MinnesotaCare as
required by paragraph (c), an individual must complete a new application.
    (e) Applicants and recipients eligible under paragraph (a), clause (1); who have applied for
and are awaiting a determination of blindness or disability by the state medical review team or
a determination of eligibility for Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability
Insurance by the Social Security Administration; who fail to meet the requirements of section
256L.09, subdivision 2; who are homeless as defined by United States Code, title 42, section
11301, et seq.; who are classified as end-stage renal disease beneficiaries in the Medicare program;

are eligible under paragraph (j); or who receive treatment funded pursuant to section 254B.02 are
exempt from the MinnesotaCare enrollment requirements of this subdivision.
   (f) For applications received on or after October 1, 2003, eligibility may begin no earlier
than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),

a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (i) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (j) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
3414                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.

services. The commissioner shall consider proposals by counties and vendors for prepaid health
plans, competitive bidding programs, block grants, or other vendor payment mechanisms designed

necessary services are provided. Before implementing prepaid programs in counties with a county
operated or affiliated public teaching hospital or a hospital or clinic operated by the University of
Minnesota, the commissioner shall consider the risks the prepaid program creates for the hospital
and allow the county or hospital the opportunity to participate in the program in a manner that
reflects the risk of adverse selection and the nature of the patients served by the hospital, provided
the terms of participation in the program are competitive with the terms of other participants
considering the nature of the population served. Payment for services provided pursuant to this
subdivision shall be as provided to medical assistance vendors of these services under sections
256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625. For payments made during fiscal year 1990 and later

care reimbursement to the provider shall be reduced by the amount of the co-payment, except that
reimbursement for prescription drugs shall not be reduced once a recipient has reached the $12 per
month maximum for prescription drug co-payments. The provider collects the co-payment from

    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.15, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Premium determination. (a) Families with children and individuals shall pay a
premium determined according to subdivision 2.
    (b) Pregnant women and children under age two are exempt from the provisions of section
256L.06, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (3), requiring disenrollment for failure to pay
premiums. For pregnant women, this exemption continues until the first day of the month following
the 60th day postpartum. Women who remain enrolled during pregnancy or the postpartum period,
despite nonpayment of premiums, shall be disenrolled on the first of the month following the 60th
day postpartum for the penalty period that otherwise applies under section 256L.06, unless they
begin paying premiums.
    (c) Members of the military and their families who meet the eligibility criteria for MinnesotaCare
upon eligibility approval made within 24 months following the end of the member's tour of active
duty shall have their premiums paid by the commissioner. The effective date of coverage for an
individual or family who meets the criteria of this paragraph shall be the first day of the month
following the month in which eligibility is approved. This exemption applies for 12 months.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, or upon federal approval, whichever
is later. The commissioner of human services shall notify the Office of the Revisor of Statutes when
federal approval is obtained.
    Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. The sliding fee scale begins with a premium of 1.5 percent
of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families with incomes below the
limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999,
and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1, 3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8

percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps ranging from the medical
assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999, to 275 percent of the
federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family size of five. The sliding fee
scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five. E                              ­­f­f­

                    i­ Families whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge
for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum
premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and
administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of
the total. The costs of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and
the enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two
enrollees shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or
more enrollees shall be three times the maximum premium for one.

   (c) Persons admitted to a Medicaid-certified nursing facility from the community on an
emergency basis as described in paragraph (d) or from an acute care facility on a nonworking day
must be screened the first working day after admission.
    (d) Emergency admission to a nursing facility prior to screening is permitted when all of the
following conditions are met:
    (1) a person is admitted from the community to a certified nursing or certified boarding care
facility during county nonworking hours;
   (2) a physician has determined that delaying admission until preadmission screening is
completed would adversely affect the person's health and safety;
   (3) there is a recent precipitating event that precludes the client from living safely in the
community, such as sustaining an injury, sudden onset of acute illness, or a caregiver's inability to
continue to provide care;
    (4) the attending physician has authorized the emergency placement and has documented the
reason that the emergency placement is recommended; and
       (5) the county is contacted on the first working day following the emergency admission.
Transfer of a patient from an acute care hospital to a nursing facility is not considered an emergency
except for a person who has received hospital services in the following situations: hospital
admission for observation, care in an emergency room without hospital admission, or following
hospital 24-hour bed care.

       Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0911, subdivision 4c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4c. Screening requirements. (a) A person may be screened for nursing facility admission
by telephone or in a face-to-face screening interview. Consultation team members shall identify each
individual's needs using the following categories:

    (1) the person needs no face-to-face screening interview to determine the need for nursing facility
level of care based on information obtained from other health care professionals;
   (2) the person needs an immediate face-to-face screening interview to determine the need for
nursing facility level of care and complete activities required under subdivision 4a; or
    (3) the person may be exempt from screening requirements as outlined in subdivision 4b, but
will need transitional assistance after admission or in-person follow-along after a return home.
    (b) Persons admitted on a nonemergency basis to a Medicaid-certified nursing facility must be
screened prior to admission.

      Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0911, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Payment for long-term care consultation services. (a) The total payment for each
county must be paid monthly by certified nursing facilities in the county. The monthly amount to
be paid by each nursing facility for each fiscal year must be determined by dividing the county's
annual allocation for long-term care consultation services by 12 to determine the monthly payment
and allocating the monthly payment to each nursing facility based on the number of licensed beds
in the nursing facility. Payments to counties in which there is no certified nursing facility must be
made by increasing the payment rate of the two facilities located nearest to the county seat.
    (b) The commissioner shall include the total annual payment determined under paragraph (a)
for each nursing facility reimbursed under section 256B.431 or 256B.434 according to section
256B.431, subdivision 2b, paragraph (g),

    (c) In the event of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway of 25
percent or more of the beds in a facility, the commissioner may adjust the per diem payment amount
in paragraph (b) and may adjust the monthly payment amount in paragraph (a). The effective date
of an adjustment made under this paragraph shall be on or after the first day of the month following
the effective date of the layaway, delicensure and decertification, or removal from layaway.
   (d) Payments for long-term care consultation services are available to the county or counties to
cover staff salaries and expenses to provide the services described in subdivision 1a. The county
shall employ, or contract with other agencies to employ, within the limits of available funding,
sufficient personnel to provide long-term care consultation services while meeting the state's
long-term care outcomes and objectives as defined in section 256B.0917, subdivision 1. The
county shall be accountable for meeting local objectives as approved by the commissioner in the
biennial home and community-based services quality assurance plan on a form provided by the
commissioner.

   (e) Notwithstanding section 256B.0641, overpayments attributable to payment of the screening
costs under the medical assistance program may not be recovered from a facility.
    (f) The commissioner of human services shall amend the Minnesota medical assistance plan to
include reimbursement for the local consultation teams.
    (g) The county may bill, as case management services, assessments, support planning, and
follow-along provided to persons determined to be eligible for case management under Minnesota
health care programs. No individual or family member shall be charged for an initial assessment or
initial support plan development provided under subdivision 3a or 3b.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0911, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 6a. Withholding. If any provider obligated to pay the long-term care consultation
amount as described in subdivision 6 is more than two months delinquent in the timely payment
of the monthly installment, the commissioner may withhold payments, penalties, and interest in
accordance with the methods outlined in section 256.9657, subdivision 7a. Any amount withheld
under this provision must be returned to the county to whom the delinquent payments were due.
      Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0911, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Reimbursement for certified nursing facilities. (a) Medical assistance reimbursement
for nursing facilities shall be authorized for a medical assistance recipient only if a preadmission
screening has been conducted prior to admission or the county has authorized an exemption. Medical
assistance reimbursement for nursing facilities shall not be provided for any recipient who the local
screener has determined does not meet the level of care criteria for nursing facility placement or, if
indicated, has not had a level II OBRA evaluation as required under the federal Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987 completed unless an admission for a recipient with mental illness is
approved by the local mental health authority or an admission for a recipient with developmental
disability is approved by the state developmental disability authority.
    (b) The nursing facility must not bill a person who is not a medical assistance recipient
for resident days that preceded the date of completion of screening activities as required under
subdivisions 4a, 4b, and 4c. The nursing facility must include unreimbursed resident days in the
nursing facility resident day totals reported to the commissioner.

      Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0913, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility for funding for services for nonmedical assistance recipients. (a) Funding
for services under the alternative care program is available to persons who meet the following
criteria:
    (1) the person has been determined by a community assessment under section 256B.0911 to be
a person who would require the level of care provided in a nursing facility, but for the provision of

services under the alternative care program;
     (2) the person is age 65 or older;
    (3) the person would be eligible for medical assistance within 135 days of admission to a nursing
facility;
    (4) the person is not ineligible for the payment of long-term care services by the medical
assistance program due to an asset transfer penalty under section 256B.0595 or equity interest in
the home exceeding $500,000 as stated in section 256B.056;
   (5) the person needs long-term care services that are not funded through other state or federal
funding;
    (6) the monthly cost of the alternative care services funded by the program for this person does
not exceed 75 percent of the monthly limit described under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3a. This
monthly limit does not prohibit the alternative care client from payment for additional services, but
in no case may the cost of additional services purchased under this section exceed the difference
between the client's monthly service limit defined under section 256B.0915, subdivision 3, and the
alternative care program monthly service limit defined in this paragraph. If m  ­­   i­­

supplies and equipment or environmental modifications and adaptations are or will be purchased
for an alternative care services recipient, the costs may be prorated on a monthly basis for up to 12
consecutive months beginning with the month of purchase. If the monthly cost of a recipient's other
alternative care services exceeds the monthly limit established in this paragraph, the annual cost of
the alternative care services shall be determined. In this event, the annual cost of alternative care
services shall not exceed 12 times the monthly limit described in this paragraph; and
     (7) the person is making timely payments of the assessed monthly fee.
A person is ineligible if payment of the fee is over 60 days past due, unless the person agrees to:
     (i) the appointment of a representative payee;
     (ii) automatic payment from a financial account;
     (iii) the establishment of greater family involvement in the financial management of payments;
or
     (iv) another method acceptable to the ­

arrangements to facilitate payment of past-due amounts and future premium payments. Following
disenrollment due to nonpayment of a monthly fee, eligibility shall not be reinstated for a period of
30 days.
    (b) Alternative care funding under this subdivision is not available for a person who is a medical
assistance recipient or who would be eligible for medical assistance without a spenddown or waiver
obligation. A person whose initial application for medical assistance and the elderly waiver program
is being processed may be served under the alternative care program for a period up to 60 days. If
the individual is found to be eligible for medical assistance, medical assistance must be billed for

    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0913, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Client fees. (a) A fee is required for all alternative care eligible clients to help pay for
the cost of participating in the program. The amount of the fee for the alternative care client shall
be determined as follows:
    (1) when the alternative care client's income less recurring and predictable medical expenses is
less than 100 percent of the federal poverty guideline effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in
which the fee is being computed, and total assets are less than $10,000, the fee is zero;
    (2) when the alternative care client's income less recurring and predictable medical expenses
is equal to or greater than 100 percent but less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline
effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the fee is being computed, and total assets are
less than $10,000, the fee is five percent of the cost of alternative care services;
    (3) when the alternative care client's income less recurring and predictable medical expenses
is equal to or greater than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
effective on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the fee is being computed and assets are less than
$10,000, the fee is 15 percent of the cost of alternative care services;
    (4) when the alternative care client's income less recurring and predictable medical expenses is
equal to or greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines effective on July 1 of the state
fiscal year in which the fee is being computed and assets are less than $10,000, the fee is 30 percent
of the cost of alternative care services; and

   (5) when the alternative care client's assets are equal to or greater than $10,000, the fee is 30
percent of the cost of alternative care services.
    For married persons, total assets are defined as the total marital assets less the estimated
community spouse asset allowance, under section 256B.059, if applicable. For married persons,
total income is defined as the client's income less the monthly spousal allotment, under section
256B.058.
    All alternative care services shall be included in the estimated costs for the purpose of
determining the fee.
    Fees are due and payable each month alternative care services are received unless the actual cost
of the services is less than the fee, in which case the fee is the lesser amount.
    (b) The fee shall be waived by the commissioner when:

criminal activity.
    The commissioner shall meet the 15 percent requirement by either conducting an audit focused
on an individual nursing facility, a group of facilities, or targeting specific data categories in multiple
nursing facilities. These audits may be conducted on site at the nursing facility, at office space used
by a nursing facility or a nursing facility's parent organization, or at the commissioner's office. Data
being audited may be collected electronically, in person, or by any other means the commissioner

procedures for determining operating cost payment rates that take into account the mix of resident
needs, geographic location, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. The commissioner
shall consider whether the fact that a facility is attached to a hospital or has an average length of
stay of 180 days or less should be taken into account in determining rates. The commissioner shall
consider the use of the standard metropolitan statistical areas when developing groups by geographic
location. The commissioner shall provide notice to each nursing facility on or before M ­­ay

    (b) Rental factor. For the rate year beginning July 1, 1988, the commissioner shall increase
the rental factor as established in Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 8, item A, by 6.2
percent rounded to the nearest 100th percent for the purpose of reimbursing nursing facilities for
soft costs and entrepreneurial profits not included in the cost valuation services used by the state's
contracted appraisers. For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1989, the rental factor is the
amount determined under this paragraph for the rate year beginning July 1, 1988.
   (c) Occupancy factor. For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1988, in order to determine
property-related payment rates under Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, for all nursing facilities
except those whose average length of stay in a skilled level of care within a nursing facility is 180
days or less, the commissioner shall use 95 percent of capacity days. For a nursing facility whose
average length of stay in a skilled level of care within a nursing facility is 180 days or less, the
commissioner shall use the greater of resident days or 80 percent of capacity days but in no event
shall the divisor exceed 95 percent of capacity days.
    (d) Equipment allowance. For rate years beginning on July 1, 1988, and July 1, 1989, the
commissioner shall add ten cents per resident per day to each nursing facility's property-related
payment rate. The ten-cent property-related payment rate increase is not cumulative from rate year
to rate year. For the rate year beginning July 1, 1990, the commissioner shall increase each nursing
facility's equipment allowance as established in Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 10, by ten
cents per resident per day. For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1991, the adjusted equipment
allowance must be adjusted annually for inflation as in Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart
10, item E. For the rate period beginning October 1, 1992, the equipment allowance for each nursing
facility shall be increased by 28 percent. For rate years beginning after June 30, 1993, the allowance
must be adjusted annually for inflation.
    (e) Post chapter 199 related-organization debts and interest expense. For rate years
beginning on or after July 1, 1990, Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 5, item E, shall not
apply to outstanding related organization debt incurred prior to May 23, 1983, provided that the
debt was an allowable debt under Minnesota Rules, parts 9510.0010 to 9510.0480, the debt is
subject to repayment through annual principal payments, and the nursing facility demonstrates to
the commissioner's satisfaction that the interest rate on the debt was less than market interest rates
for similar arm's-length transactions at the time the debt was incurred. If the debt was incurred
due to a sale between family members, the nursing facility must also demonstrate that the seller
no longer participates in the management or operation of the nursing facility. Debts meeting the
conditions of this paragraph are subject to all other provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010
to 9549.0080.
    (f) Building capital allowance for nursing facilities with operating leases. For rate years
beginning on or after July 1, 1990, a nursing facility with operating lease costs incurred for the
nursing facility's buildings shall receive its building capital allowance computed in accordance with
Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 8. If an operating lease provides that the lessee's rent
is adjusted to recognize improvements made by the lessor and related debt, the costs for capital
improvements and related debt shall be allowed in the computation of the lessee's building capital
allowance, provided that reimbursement for these costs under an operating lease shall not exceed
the rate otherwise paid.

per licensed bed in multiple-bed rooms, $92,850 per licensed bed in semiprivate rooms with a fixed
partition separating the resident beds, and $111,420 per licensed bed in single rooms. Minnesota
Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart 11, item C, subitem (2), does not apply. These amounts must be
adjusted annually as specified in subdivision 3f, paragraph (a), beginning January 1, 2000.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.431, subdivision 41, is amended to read:
    Subd. 41. Rate increases for October 1, 2005, and October 1, 2006. (a) For the rate period
beginning October 1, 2005, the commissioner shall make available to each nursing facility
reimbursed under this section or section 256B.434 an adjustment equal to 2.2553 percent of the
total operating payment rate, and for the rate year beginning October 1, 2006, the commissioner
shall make available to each nursing facility reimbursed under this section or section 256B.434 an
adjustment equal to 1.2553 percent of the total operating payment rate.
    (b) 75 percent of the money resulting from the rate adjustment under paragraph (a) must be used
to increase wages and benefits and pay associated costs for all employees, except management fees,
the administrator, and central office staff. Except as provided in paragraph (c), 75 percent of the
money received by a facility as a result of the rate adjustment provided in paragraph (a) must be
used only for wage, benefit, and staff increases implemented on or after the effective date of the rate
increase each year, and must not be used for increases implemented prior to that date.
    (c) With respect only to the October 1, 2005, rate increase, a nursing facility that incurred costs
for salary and employee benefit increases first provided after July 1, 2003, may count those costs
towards the amount required to be spent on salaries and benefits under paragraph (b). These costs
must be reported to the commissioner in the form and manner specified by the commissioner.
    (d) Nursing facilities may apply for the portion of the rate adjustment under paragraph (a)
for employee wages and benefits and associated costs. The application must be made to the
commissioner and contain a plan by which the nursing facility will distribute the funds according
to paragraph (b). For nursing facilities in which the employees are represented by an exclusive
bargaining representative, an agreement negotiated and agreed to by the employer and the exclusive
bargaining representative constitutes the plan. A negotiated agreement may constitute the plan
only if the agreement is finalized after the date of enactment of all increases for the rate year and
signed by both parties prior to submission to the commissioner. The commissioner shall review
the plan to ensure that the rate adjustments are used as provided in paragraph (b). To be eligible,
a facility must submit its distribution plan by March 31, 2006, and March 31, 2007, respectively.
The commissioner may approve distribution plans on or before June 30, 2006, and June 30, 2007,
respectively. The commissioner may waive the deadlines in this paragraph under extraordinary
circumstances, either retroactively or prospectively, to be determined at the sole discretion of the
commissioner. If a facility's distribution plan is effective after the first day of the applicable rate
period that the funds are available, the rate adjustments are effective the same date as the facility's
plan.

    (e) A copy of the approved distribution plan must be made available to all employees by giving
each employee a copy or by posting a copy in an area of the nursing facility to which all employees
have access. If an employee does not receive the wage and benefit adjustment described in the
facility's approved plan and is unable to resolve the problem with the facility's management or
through the employee's union representative, the employee may contact the commissioner at an
address or telephone number provided by the commissioner and included in the approved plan.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective upon enactment and is retroactive from October
1, 2005.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.49, subdivision 11, is amended to read:

community-based service waivers, as authorized under section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act
to serve persons under the age of 65 who are determined to require the level of care provided in a
nursing home and persons who require the level of care provided in a hospital. The commissioner
shall apply for the home and community-based waivers in order to:
   (i) promote the support of persons with disabilities in the most integrated settings;
   (ii) expand the availability of services for persons who are eligible for medical assistance;
   (iii) promote cost-effective options to institutional care; and
   (iv) obtain federal financial participation.
    (b) The provision of waivered services to medical assistance recipients with disabilities shall
comply with the requirements outlined in the federally approved applications for home and
community-based services and subsequent amendments, including provision of services according

   Sec. 47. LICENSURE; SERVICES FOR YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES.
    (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 245A, upon the
recommendation of a county agency, the commissioner of human services shall grant a license
with any necessary variances to a nonresidential program for youth that provides services to youth
with disabilities under age 21 during nonschool hours established to ensure health and safety,
prevent out-of-home placement, and increase community inclusion of youth with disabilities. The
nonresidential youth program is subject to the conditions of any variances granted and to consumer
rights standards under Minnesota Statutes, section 245B.04; consumer protection standards under
Minnesota Statutes, section 245B.05; service standards under Minnesota Statutes, section 245B.06;
management standards under Minnesota Statutes, section 245B.07; and fire marshal inspections

requirements in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 245A, to allow licensure of appropriate services for
school-age youth with disabilities under age 21 who need supervision and services to develop

    Subd. 4. Criteria for review. The following criteria shall be used in a consistent manner to
compare, evaluate, and rank all proposals submitted. Except for the criteria specified in clause (3),
the application of criteria listed under this subdivision shall not reflect any distinction based on the
geographic location of the proposed project:
    (1) the extent to which the proposal furthers state long-term care goals, including the goal of
enhancing the availability and use of alternative care services and the goal of reducing the number
of long-term care resident rooms with more than two beds;
   (2) the proposal's long-term effects on state costs including the cost estimate of the project
according to section 144A.071, subdivision 5a;
    (3) the extent to which the proposal promotes equitable access to long-term care services in
nursing homes through redistribution of the nursing home bed supply, as measured by the number
of beds relative to the population 85 or older, projected to the year 2000 by the state demographer,
and according to items (i) to (iv):
   (i) reduce beds in counties where the supply is high, relative to the statewide mean, and increase
beds in counties where the supply is low, relative to the statewide mean;
   (ii) adjust the bed supply so as to create the greatest benefits in improving the distribution of
beds;
    (iii) adjust the existing bed supply in counties so that the bed supply in a county moves toward
the statewide mean; and
   (iv) adjust the existing bed supply so that the distribution of beds as projected for the year 2020
would be consistent with projected need, based on the methodology outlined in the Interagency
Long-Term Care Committee's nursing home bed distribution study;
   (4) the extent to which the project improves conditions that affect the health or safety of residents,
such as narrow corridors, narrow door frames, unenclosed fire exits, and wood frame construction,
and similar provisions contained in fire and life safety codes and licensure and certification rules;
    (5) the extent to which the project improves conditions that affect the comfort or quality of life
of residents in a facility or the ability of the facility to provide efficient care, such as a relatively high
number of residents in a room; inadequate lighting or ventilation; poor access to bathing or toilet
facilities; a lack of available ancillary space for dining rooms, day rooms, or rooms used for other
activities; problems relating to heating, cooling, or energy efficiency; inefficient location of nursing

state and federal statutes and rules, to residents as evidenced by the two most recent state agency
certification surveys and the applicants' response to those surveys;
   (7) the extent to which the project removes the need for waivers or variances previously granted
by either the licensing agency, certifying agency, fire marshal, or local government entity;

comfort, treatment, or well-being of the facility's residents.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 252.27, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Contribution amount. (a) The natural or adoptive parents of a minor child, including
a child determined eligible for medical assistance without consideration of parental income, must
contribute to the cost of services used by making monthly payments on a sliding scale based on
income, unless the child is married or has been married, parental rights have been terminated, or
the child's adoption is subsidized according to section 259.67 or through title IV-E of the Social
Security Act. The parental contribution is a partial or full payment for medical services provided
for diagnostic, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating, rehabilitation, maintenance, and personal
care services as defined in United States Code, title 26, section 213, needed by the child with a
chronic illness or disability.
    (b) For households with adjusted gross income equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal
poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be computed by applying the following schedule
of rates to the adjusted gross income of the natural or adoptive parents:
    (1) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 100 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution is $4
per month;
   (2) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 175 percent of federal poverty
guidelines and less than or equal to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental
contribution shall be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of
human services which begins at one percent of adjusted gross income at 175 percent of federal
poverty guidelines and increases to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted
gross income up to 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines;
    (3) if the adjusted gross income is greater than 545 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
less than 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 7.5 percent of
adjusted gross income;
   (4) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 675 percent of federal poverty
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                           3461

guidelines and less than 975 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the parental contribution shall
be determined using a sliding fee scale established by the commissioner of human services which
begins at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income at 675 percent of federal poverty guidelines and
increases to ten percent of adjusted gross income for those with adjusted gross income up to 975
percent of federal poverty guidelines; and
   (5) if the adjusted gross income is equal to or greater than 975 percent of federal poverty
guidelines, the parental contribution shall be 12.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
    If the child lives with the parent, the annual adjusted gross income is reduced by $2,400 prior
to calculating the parental contribution. If the child resides in an institution specified in section
256B.35, the parent is responsible for the personal needs allowance specified under that section
in addition to the parental contribution determined under this section. The parental contribution is
reduced by any amount required to be paid directly to the child pursuant to a court order, but only
if actually paid.
    (c) The household size to be used in determining the amount of contribution under paragraph (b)
includes natural and adoptive parents and their dependents, including the child receiving services.
Adjustments in the contribution amount due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines
shall be implemented on the first day of July following publication of the changes.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (b), "income" means the adjusted gross income of the natural
or adoptive parents determined according to the previous year's federal tax form, except, effective
retroactive to July 1, 2003, taxable capital gains to the extent the funds have been used to purchase
a home shall not be counted as income.
    (e) The contribution shall be explained in writing to the parents at the time eligibility for services
is being determined. The contribution shall be made on a monthly basis effective with the first month
in which the child receives services. Annually upon redetermination or at termination of eligibility, if
the contribution exceeded the cost of services provided, the local agency or the state shall reimburse
that excess amount to the parents, either by direct reimbursement if the parent is no longer required
to pay a contribution, or by a reduction in or waiver of parental fees until the excess amount is
exhausted.
    (f) The monthly contribution amount must be reviewed at least every 12 months; when there
is a change in household size; and when there is a loss of or gain in income from one month to
another in excess of ten percent. The local agency shall mail a written notice 30 days in advance of
the effective date of a change in the contribution amount. A decrease in the contribution amount is
effective in the month that the parent verifies a reduction in income or change in household size.
    (g) Parents of a minor child who do not live with each other shall each pay the contribution
required under paragraph (a). An amount equal to the annual court-ordered child support payment
actually paid on behalf of the child receiving services shall be deducted from the adjusted gross
income of the parent making the payment prior to calculating the parental contribution under
paragraph (b).
    (h) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be increased by an additional five percent if
the local agency determines that insurance coverage is available but not obtained for the child.
For purposes of this section, "available" means the insurance is a benefit of employment for a
family member at an annual cost of no more than five percent of the family's annual income. For
3462                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [63RD DAY

purposes of this section, "insurance" means health and accident insurance coverage, enrollment
in a nonprofit health service plan, health maintenance organization, self-insured plan, or preferred
provider organization.
    Parents who have more than one child receiving services shall not be required to pay more than
the amount for the child with the highest expenditures. There shall be no resource contribution from
the parents. The parent shall not be required to pay a contribution in excess of the cost of the services
provided to the child, not counting payments made to school districts for education-related services.
Notice of an increase in fee payment must be given at least 30 days before the increased fee is due.
  (i) The contribution under paragraph (b) shall be reduced by $300 per fiscal year if, in the 12
months prior to July 1:
   (1) the parent applied for insurance for the child;
   (2) the insurer denied insurance;
    (3) the parents submitted a complaint or appeal, in writing to the insurer, submitted a complaint
or appeal, in writing, to the commissioner of health or the commissioner of commerce, or litigated
the complaint or appeal; and
   (4) as a result of the dispute, the insurer reversed its decision and granted insurance.
   For purposes of this section, "insurance" has the meaning given in paragraph (h).
    A parent who has requested a reduction in the contribution amount under this paragraph shall
submit proof in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner or county agency, including,
but not limited to, the insurer's denial of insurance, the written letter or complaint of the parents,
court documents, and the written response of the insurer approving insurance. The determinations
of the commissioner or county agency under this paragraph are not rules subject to chapter 14.

not own more than $6,000 in assets, plus $200 for each additional legal dependent. In addition to
these maximum amounts, an eligible individual or family may accrue interest on these amounts, but
they must be reduced to the maximum at the time of an eligibility redetermination. The accumulation
of the clothing and personal needs allowance according to section 256B.35 must also be reduced to

of ineligibility as an employed person with a disability, to the extent that the person's total assets
remain within the allowed limits of section 256B.057, subdivision 9, paragraph (b).
    (f) When a person enrolled in medical assistance under section 256B.057, subdivision 9, reaches

limits of section 256B.057, subdivision 9, paragraph (b), when determining eligibility for medical
assistance under section 256B.055, subdivision 7. The income of a spouse of a person enrolled in
medical assistance under section 256B.057, subdivision 9, during each of the 24 consecutive months
before the person's 65th birthday must be disregarded when determining eligibility for medical
assistance under section 256B.055, subdivision 7, when the person reaches age 65. This paragraph

when approval is obtained.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0651, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Prior authorization; time limits. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee
shall determine the time period for which a prior authorization shall be effective and, if flexible use
has been requested, whether to allow the flexible use option. If the recipient continues to require
home care services beyond the duration of the prior authorization, the home care provider must
request a new prior authorization. A personal care provider agency must request a new personal
care assistant services assessment, or service update if allowed, at least 60 days prior to the end of
the current prior authorization time period. The request for the assessment must be made on a form
approved by the commissioner. Under no circumstances, other than the exceptions in subdivision 4,
shall a prior authorization be valid prior to the date the commissioner receives the request or for more
than 12 months. A recipient who appeals a reduction in previously authorized home care services
may continue previously authorized services, other than temporary services under subdivision 8,
pending an appeal under section 256.045. The commissioner must provide a detailed explanation of
why the authorized services are reduced in amount from those requested by the home care provider.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0655, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:

for home care services conducted in person. Assessments for personal care assistant services
shall be conducted by the county public health nurse or a certified public health nurse under
contract with the county. A face-to-face assessment must include: documentation of health status,
determination of need, evaluation of service effectiveness, identification of appropriate services,
service plan development or modification, coordination of services, referrals and follow-up to
appropriate payers and community resources, completion of required reports, recommendation of
service authorization, and consumer education. Once the need for personal care assistant services
is determined under this section or sections 256B.0651, 256B.0653, 256B.0654, and 256B.0656,
the county public health nurse or certified public health nurse under contract with the county is
responsible for communicating this recommendation to the commissioner and the recipient. A
face-to-face assessment for personal care assistant services is conducted on those recipients who
have never had a county public health nurse assessment. A face-to-face assessment must occur
at least annually or when there is a significant change in the recipient's condition or when there
is a change in the need for personal care assistant services. A service update may substitute for
the annual face-to-face assessment when there is not a significant change in recipient condition
or a change in the need for personal care assistant service. A service update may be completed
by telephone, used when there is no need for an increase in personal care assistant services, and
used for two consecutive assessments if followed by a face-to-face assessment. A service update
must be completed on a form approved by the commissioner. A service update or review for
temporary increase includes a review of initial baseline data, evaluation of service effectiveness,
redetermination of service need, modification of service plan and appropriate referrals, update of
initial forms, obtaining service authorization, and on going consumer education. Assessments must
be completed on forms provided by the commissioner within 30 days of a request for home care
services by a recipient or responsible party or personal care provider agency.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0655, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Assessment and service plan. Assessments under subdivision 1b and sections
256B.0651, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), and 256B.0654, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), shall be
conducted initially, and at least annually thereafter, in person with the recipient and result in a
completed service plan using forms specified by the commissioner. A personal care provider
agency must use a form approved by the commissioner to request a county public health nurse
to conduct a personal care assistant services assessment. When requesting a reassessment, the
personal care provider agency must notify the county and the recipient at least 60 days prior
to the end of the current prior authorization for personal care assistant services. The recipient
notice shall include information on the recipient's appeal rights. Within 30 days of recipient or
responsible party or personal care assistant provider agency request for home care services, the
assessment, the service plan, and other information necessary to determine medical necessity such
as diagnostic or testing information, social or medical histories, and hospital or facility discharge
summaries shall be submitted to the commissioner. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision
8, the commissioner shall maximize federal financial participation to pay for public health nurse
assessments for personal care services. For personal care assistant services:
    (1) The amount and type of service authorized based upon the assessment and service plan will
follow the recipient if the recipient chooses to change providers.
    (2) If the recipient's need changes, the recipient's provider may assess the need for a change in
service authorization and request the change from the county public health nurse. The request must

be made on a form approved by the commissioner. Within 30 days of the request, the public health
nurse will determine whether to request the change in services based upon the provider assessment,
or conduct a home visit to assess the need and determine whether the change is appropriate. If the
change in service need is due to a change in medical condition, a new physician's statement of need
required by section 256B.0625, subdivision 19c, must be obtained.
    (3) To continue to receive personal care assistant services after the first year, the recipient or the
responsible party, in conjunction with the public health nurse, may complete a service update on
forms developed by the commissioner according to criteria and procedures in subdivisions 1a to 1i
and sections 256B.0651, subdivision 1; 256B.0653, subdivision 1; and 256B.0654, subdivision 1.

   (ii) $105.25 for each service update; and
   (iii) $105.25 for each request for a temporary service increase.
    (b) The rates specified in paragraph (a) must be adjusted to reflect provider rate increases for
personal care assistant services that are approved by the legislature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 2000, and subsequent fiscal years. Any requirements applied by the legislature to provider rate
increases for personal care assistant services also apply to adjustments under this paragraph.
    (c) Effective July 1, 2008, the payment rate for an assessment under this section and section
256B.0651 shall be reduced by 25 percent when the assessment is not completed on time or the
service agreement documentation is not submitted in time to continue services. The commissioner
shall recoup these amounts on a retroactive basis.

offering or providing assisted living under chapter 144G shall inform all prospective residents
of the availability of and contact information for transitional consultation services under this
subdivision prior to executing a lease or contract with the prospective resident. The purpose of
transitional long-term care consultation is to support persons with current or anticipated long-term
care needs in making informed choices among options that include the most cost-effective and
least restrictive settings, and to delay spenddown to eligibility for publicly funded programs by
connecting people to alternative services in their homes before transition to housing with services.
Regardless of the consultation, prospective residents maintain the right to choose housing with
services or assisted living if that option is their preference.
    (b) Transitional consultation services are provided as determined by the commissioner of human
services in partnership with county long-term care consultation units, and the Area Agencies on
Aging, and are a combination of telephone-based and in-person assistance provided under models
developed by the commissioner. The consultation shall be performed in a manner that provides
objective and complete information. Transitional consultation must be provided within five working
days of the request of the prospective resident as follows:

   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0913, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 17. Services for persons using reverse mortgages. (a) Alternative care services are
available to a person if:
    (1) the person qualifies for the reverse mortgage incentive program under section 462A.05,
subdivision 42, and has received the final payment on a qualifying reverse mortgage, or the person
satisfies the criteria in section 462A.05, subdivision 42, paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (5), and has
otherwise obtained a reverse mortgage and payments from the reverse mortgage for a period of at
least 24 months or in an amount of at least $15,000 are used for services and supports, including
basic shelter needs, home maintenance, and modifications or adaptations, necessary to allow the
person to remain in the home as an alternative to a nursing facility placement; and
    (2) the person satisfies the eligibility criteria under this section, other than age, income, and
assets, and verifies that reverse mortgage expenditures were made according to the spending plan
established under section 256B.0911, if one has been established.
    (b) In addition to the other services provided under this section, a person who qualifies under this
subdivision shall not be assessed a monthly participation fee under subdivision 12 nor be subject to
an estate claim under section 256B.15 for services received under this section.
    (c) The commissioner shall require a certification of loan satisfaction or other documentation
that the person qualifies under this subdivision.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0915, is amended to read:
   256B.0915 MEDICAID WAIVER FOR ELDERLY SERVICES.
    Subdivision 1. Authority. The commissioner is authorized to apply for a home and
community-based services waiver for the elderly, authorized under section 1915(c) of the Social
Security Act, in order to obtain federal financial participation to expand the availability of services
for persons who are eligible for medical assistance. The commissioner may apply for additional
waivers or pursue other federal financial participation which is advantageous to the state for
funding home care services for the frail elderly who are eligible for medical assistance. The
provision of waivered services to elderly and disabled medical assistance recipients must comply
with the criteria for service definitions and provider standards approved in the waiver.
    Subd. 1a. Elderly waiver case management services. (a) Elderly case management services
under the home and community-based services waiver for elderly individuals are available from
providers meeting qualification requirements and the standards specified in subdivision 1b. Eligible
recipients may choose any qualified provider of elderly case management services.
   Case management services assist individuals who receive waiver services in gaining access to
needed waiver and other state plan services, as well as needed medical, social, educational, and
other services regardless of the funding source for the services to which access is gained.
    A case aide shall provide assistance to the case manager in carrying out administrative activities
of the case management function. The case aide may not assume responsibilities that require
professional judgment including assessments, reassessments, and care plan development. The case
manager is responsible for providing oversight of the case aide.

    Case managers shall be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the provision of services included
in the individual's plan of care. Case managers shall initiate and oversee the process of assessment
and reassessment of the individual's care and review plan of care at intervals specified in the federally
approved waiver plan.
    (b) The county of service or tribe must provide access to and arrange for case management
services. County of service has the meaning given it in Minnesota Rules, part 9505.0015, subpart
11.
    Subd. 1b. Provider qualifications and standards. The commissioner must enroll qualified
providers of elderly case management services under the home and community-based waiver for
the elderly under section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act. The enrollment process shall ensure the
provider's ability to meet the qualification requirements and standards in this subdivision and other
federal and state requirements of this service. An elderly case management provider is an enrolled
medical assistance provider who is determined by the commissioner to have all of the following
characteristics:
    (1) the demonstrated capacity and experience to provide the components of case management
to coordinate and link community resources needed by the eligible population;
   (2) administrative capacity and experience in serving the target population for whom it will
provide services and in ensuring quality of services under state and federal requirements;
   (3) a financial management system that provides accurate documentation of services and costs
under state and federal requirements;
   (4) the capacity to document and maintain individual case records under state and federal
requirements; and
    (5) the ­co
              ­u­n t­ lead agency may allow a case manager employed by the ­
                 ­­y                                                           co

to delegate certain aspects of the case management activity to another individual employed by
the ­
    co­u
       ­­ t­ lead agency provided there is oversight of the individual by the case manager. The
        n­y
case manager may not delegate those aspects which require professional judgment including
assessments, reassessments, and care plan development. Lead agencies include counties, health
plans, and federally recognized tribes who authorize services under this section.

rate of the case mix resident class to which the elderly waiver client would be assigned under
Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the recipient's maintenance needs allowance
as described in subdivision 1d, paragraph (a), until the first day of the state fiscal year in which the
resident assessment system as described in section 256B.437 for nursing home rate determination
is implemented. Effective on the first day of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment
system as described in section 256B.437 for nursing home rate determination is implemented and
the first day of each subsequent state fiscal year, the monthly limit for the cost of waivered services
to an individual elderly waiver client shall be the rate of the case mix resident class to which the
waiver client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, in effect
on the last day of the previous state fiscal year, adjusted by the greater of any legislatively adopted
home and community-based services percentage rate increase or the average statewide percentage
increase in nursing facility payment rates.
    (b) If extended medical supplies and equipment or environmental modifications are or will be
purchased for an elderly waiver client, the costs may be prorated for up to 12 consecutive months
beginning with the month of purchase. If the monthly cost of a recipient's waivered services exceeds

a person who is a nursing facility resident at the time of requesting a determination of eligibility
for elderly waivered services, a monthly conversion limit for the cost of elderly waivered services
may be requested. The monthly conversion limit for the cost of elderly waiver services shall be the
resident class assigned under Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, for that resident in
the nursing facility where the resident currently resides until July 1 of the state fiscal year in which

resides multiplied by 365 and divided by 12, less the recipient's maintenance needs allowance as
described in subdivision 1d. The initially approved conversion rate may be adjusted by the greater
of any subsequent legislatively adopted home and community-based services percentage rate
increase or the average statewide percentage increase in nursing facility payment rates. The limit
under this subdivision only applies to persons discharged from a nursing facility after a minimum
30-day stay and found eligible for waivered services on or after July 1, 1997. For conversions
from the nursing home to the elderly waiver with consumer directed community support services,
the conversion rate limit is equal to the nursing facility rate reduced by a percentage equal to the
percentage difference between the consumer directed services budget limit that would be assigned
according to the federally approved waiver plan and the corresponding community case mix cap,
but not to exceed 50 percent.
    (b) The following costs must be included in determining the total monthly costs for the waiver
client:
   (1) cost of all waivered services, including extended medical supplies and equipment and
environmental modifications and adaptations; and
    (2) cost of skilled nursing, home health aide, and personal care services reimbursable by medical
assistance.
    Subd. 3c. Service approval and contracting provisions. (a) Medical assistance funding for
skilled nursing services, private duty nursing, home health aide, and personal care services for
waiver recipients must be approved by the case manager and included in the individual care plan.

the state fiscal year for which the rate limit is being calculated, of the greater of either the statewide
or any of the geographic groups' weighted average monthly nursing facility rate of the case mix
resident class to which the elderly waiver eligible client would be assigned under Minnesota Rules,
parts 9549.0050 to 9549.0059, less the maintenance needs allowance as described in subdivision
1d, paragraph (a), until the July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system

on July 1 of the state fiscal year in which the resident assessment system as described in section
256B.437 for nursing home rate determination is implemented and July 1 of each subsequent state
fiscal year, the individualized monthly negotiated payment for the services described in this clause
shall not exceed the limit described in this clause which was in effect on June 30 of the previous
state fiscal year and which has been adjusted by the greater of any legislatively adopted home and
community-based services cost-of-living percentage increase or any legislatively adopted statewide
percent rate increase for nursing facilities.

up to the statewide maximum service rate limit.
    Subd. 3h. Service rate limits; 24-hour customized living services. The payment rates for
24-hour customized living services is a monthly rate negotiated and authorized by the lead agency
within the parameters established by the commissioner of human services. The payment agreement
must delineate the services that have been customized for each recipient and specify the amount
of each service to be provided. The lead agency shall ensure that there is a documented need for
all services authorized. The lead agency shall not authorize 24-hour customized living services
unless there is a documented need for 24-hour supervision. For purposes of this section, "24-hour
supervision" means that the recipient requires assistance due to needs related to one or more of the
following:
   (1) intermittent assistance with toileting or transferring;
   (2) cognitive or behavioral issues;
   (3) a medical condition that requires clinical monitoring; or
    (4) other conditions or needs as defined by the commissioner of human services. The
lead agency shall ensure that the frequency and mode of supervision of the recipient and the
qualifications of staff providing supervision are described and meet the needs of the recipient.
Customized living services must not include rent or raw food costs. The negotiated payment rate
for 24-hour customized living services must be based on services to be provided. Negotiated rates
must not exceed payment rates for comparable elderly waiver or medical assistance services and
must reflect economies of scale. The individually negotiated 24-hour customized living payments,
in combination with the payment for other elderly waiver services, including case management,
must not exceed the recipient's community budget cap specified in subdivision 3a.
    Subd. 4. Termination notice. The case manager must give the individual a ten-day written notice
of any denial, reduction, or termination of waivered services.
    Subd. 5. Assessments and reassessments for waiver clients. Each client shall receive an
initial assessment of strengths, informal supports, and need for services in accordance with section
256B.0911, subdivisions 3, 3a, and 3b. A reassessment of a client served under the elderly waiver
must be conducted at least every 12 months and at other times when the case manager determines
that there has been significant change in the client's functioning. This may include instances where
the client is discharged from the hospital.
    Subd. 6. Implementation of care plan. Each elderly waiver client shall be provided a copy of
a written care plan that meets the requirements outlined in section 256B.0913, subdivision 8. The

   256B.095 QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED.
    (a) Effective July 1, 1998, a quality assurance system for persons with developmental
disabilities, which includes an alternative quality assurance licensing system for programs, is
established in Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Mower, Olmsted, Rice, Steele,
Wabasha, and Winona Counties for the purpose of improving the quality of services provided to
persons with developmental disabilities. A county, at its option, may choose to have all programs
for persons with developmental disabilities located within the county licensed under chapter
245A using standards determined under the alternative quality assurance licensing system or may
continue regulation of these programs under the licensing system operated by the commissioner.

apply to a new system established under this paragraph. The commissioner shall delegate authority
to a new system established under this paragraph according to section 256B.0955.
    (d) Effective July 1, 2007, the quality assurance system may be expanded to include programs
for persons with disabilities and older adults.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0951, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Membership. The Quality Assurance Commission is established. The

  Sec. 24. [256B.096] QUALITY MANAGEMENT, ASSURANCE, AND IMPROVEMENT
SYSTEM FOR MINNESOTANS RECEIVING DISABILITY SERVICES.
    Subdivision 1. Scope. In order to improve the quality of services provided to Minnesotans with
disabilities and to meet the requirements of the federally approved home and community-based
waivers under section 1915c of the Social Security Act, a statewide quality assurance and
improvement system for Minnesotans receiving disability services shall be developed. The
disability services included are the home and community-based services waiver programs for
persons with developmental disabilities under section 256B.092, subdivision 4, and for persons
with disabilities under section 256B.49.
    Subd. 2. Stakeholder advisory group. The commissioner shall consult with a stakeholder
advisory group on the development and implementation of the state quality management,
assurance, and improvement system, including representatives of disability service recipients,
disability service providers, disability advocacy groups, county human service agencies, and state
agency staff from the Departments of Human Services and Health, and the ombudsman for mental
health and developmental disabilities on the development of a statewide quality assurance and
improvement system.
    Subd. 3. Annual survey of service recipients. The commissioner, in consultation with the
stakeholder advisory group, shall develop an annual independent random statewide survey of
between five and ten percent of service recipients to determine the effectiveness and quality of
disability services. The survey shall be consistent with the system performance expectations of the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality management requirements and framework.
The survey shall analyze whether desired outcomes have been achieved for persons with different
demographic, diagnostic, health, and functional needs receiving different types of services, in
different settings, with different costs. The survey shall be field tested during 2008. The biennial
report established in subdivision 5 shall include recommendations on statewide and regional
reports of the survey results that, if published, would be useful to regions, counties, and providers
3484                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

to plan and measure the impact of quality improvement activities.
    Subd. 4. Improvements for incident reporting, investigation, analysis, and follow-up. In
consultation with the stakeholder advisory group, the commissioner shall identify the information,
data sources, and technology needed to improve the system of incident reporting, including:
      (1) reports made under the Maltreatment of Minors and Vulnerable Adults Acts; and
      (2) investigation, analysis, and follow-up for disability services.
The commissioner must ensure that the federal home and community-based waiver requirements
are met and that incidents that may have jeopardized safety and health or violated service-related
assurances, civil and human rights, and other protections designed to prevent abuse, neglect, and
exploitation, are reviewed, investigated, and acted upon in a timely manner.
    Subd. 5. Biennial report. The commissioner shall provide a biennial report to the chairs of
the legislative committees with jurisdiction over health and human services policy and funding
beginning January 15, 2009, on the development and activities of the quality management,
assurance, and improvement system designed to meet the federal requirements under the home and
community-based services waiver programs for persons with disabilities. By January 15, 2008, the
commissioner shall provide a preliminary report on priorities for meeting the federal requirements,
progress on development and field testing of the annual survey, appropriations necessary to
implement an annual survey of service recipients once field testing is completed, recommendations
for improvements in the incident reporting system, and a plan for incorporating quality assurance
efforts under section 256B.095 and other regional efforts into the statewide system.
      Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.15, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Recovery of alternative care and certain reverse mortgages. The state and a county
agency shall not recover alternative care paid for a person under section 256B.0913, subdivision 17,
under this section.
      Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.431, subdivision 2e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2e. Contracts for services for ventilator-dependent persons. (a) The commissioner may
negotiate with a nursing facility eligible to receive medical assistance payments to provide services
to a ventilator-dependent person identified by the commissioner according to criteria developed by
the commissioner, including:
      (1) nursing facility care has been recommended for the person by a preadmission screening team;
      (2) the person has been hospitalized and no longer requires inpatient acute care hospital services;
and
   (3) the commissioner has determined that necessary services for the person cannot be provided
under existing nursing facility rates.
   The commissioner may negotiate an adjustment to the operating cost payment rate for a
nursing facility with a resident who is ventilator-dependent, for that resident. The negotiated
adjustment must reflect only the actual additional cost of meeting the specialized care needs of a
ventilator-dependent person identified by the commissioner for whom necessary services cannot
be provided under existing nursing facility rates and which are not otherwise covered under
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                           3485

Minnesota Rules, parts 9549.0010 to 9549.0080 or 9505.0170 to 9505.0475. For persons who
are initially admitted to a nursing facility before July 1, 2001, and have their payment rate under
this subdivision negotiated after July 1, 2001, the negotiated payment rate must not exceed 200
percent of the highest multiple bedroom payment rate for the facility, as initially established by
the commissioner for the rate year for case mix classification K; or, upon implementation of
the RUG's-based case mix system, 200 percent of the highest RUG's rate. For persons initially
admitted to a nursing facility on or after July 1, 2001, the negotiated payment rate must not exceed
300 percent of the facility's multiple bedroom payment rate for case mix classification K; or, upon
implementation of the RUG's-based case mix system, 300 percent of the highest RUG's rate. The
negotiated adjustment shall not affect the payment rate charged to private paying residents under
the provisions of section 256B.48, subdivision 1.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2007, or upon opening a unit of at least ten beds dedicated to care of
ventilator-dependent persons in partnership with Mayo Health Systems, whichever is later, the
operating payment rates for residents determined eligible under paragraph (a) of a nursing facility
in Waseca County that on February 1, 2007, was licensed for 70 beds and reimbursed under this
section, section 256B.434, or section 256B.441, shall be 300 percent of the facility's highest RUG
rate.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.431, subdivision 17a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 17a. Allowable interest expense. (a) Notwithstanding Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060,
subparts 5, item A, subitems (1) and (3), and 7, item D, allowable interest expense on debt shall
include:
   (1) interest expense on debt related to the cost of purchasing or replacing depreciable equipment,
excluding vehicles, not to exceed ­s­x
                                    i­ ten percent of the total historical cost of the project; and
    (2) interest expense on debt related to financing or refinancing costs, including costs related to
points, loan origination fees, financing charges, legal fees, and title searches; and issuance costs
including bond discounts, bond counsel, underwriter's counsel, corporate counsel, printing, and
financial forecasts. Allowable debt related to items in this clause shall not exceed seven percent
of the total historical cost of the project. To the extent these costs are financed, the straight-line
amortization of the costs in this clause is not an allowable cost; and
    (3) interest on debt incurred for the establishment of a debt reserve fund, net of the interest earned
on the debt reserve fund.
   (b) Debt incurred for costs under paragraph (a) is not subject to Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060,
subpart 5, item A, subitem (5) or (6).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective October 1, 2007.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.434, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Alternate rates for nursing facilities. (a) For nursing facilities which have their
payment rates determined under this section rather than section 256B.431, the commissioner shall
establish a rate under this subdivision. The nursing facility must enter into a written contract with
the commissioner.
   (b) A nursing facility's case mix payment rate for the first rate year of a facility's contract under
3486                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

this section is the payment rate the facility would have received under section 256B.431.
    (c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a
facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an
inflation adjustment and, for facilities reimbursed under this section or section 256B.431, an
adjustment to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing fees for the facility
taking effect on or after July 1, 2001. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted by
the commissioner of finance's national economic consultant, as forecasted in the fourth quarter of
the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be based on the 12-month
period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the rate year for which the
rate is being determined. For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1999, July 1, 2000, July 1, 2001,
July 1, 2002, July 1, 2003, July 1, 2004, July 1, 2005, July 1, 2006, July 1, 2007, ­
                                                                                    a­

July 1, 2009, and July 1, 2010, this paragraph shall apply only to the property-related payment
rate, except that adjustments to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing
fees taking effect on or after July 1, 2001, shall be provided. Beginning in 2005, adjustment to the
property payment rate under this section and section 256B.431 shall be effective on October 1. In
determining the amount of the property-related payment rate adjustment under this paragraph, the
commissioner shall determine the proportion of the facility's rates that are property-related based
on the facility's most recent cost report.
    (d) The commissioner shall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent
above a facility's operating payment rate for achieving outcomes specified in a contract. The
commissioner may solicit contract amendments and implement those which, on a competitive
basis, best meet the state's policy objectives. The commissioner shall limit the amount of any
incentive payment and the number of contract amendments under this paragraph to operate the
incentive payments within funds appropriated for this purpose. The contract amendments may
specify various levels of payment for various levels of performance. Incentive payments to facilities
under this paragraph may be in the form of time-limited rate adjustments or onetime supplemental
payments. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria, the commissioner shall
consider the following state policy objectives:
   (1) successful diversion or discharge of residents to the residents' prior home or other
community-based alternatives;
   (2) adoption of new technology to improve quality or efficiency;
   (3) improved quality as measured in the Nursing Home Report Card;
   (4) reduced acute care costs; and
   (5) any additional outcomes proposed by a nursing facility that the commissioner finds desirable.
    (e) Notwithstanding the threshold in section 256B.431, subdivision 16, facilities that take action
to come into compliance with existing or pending requirements of the life safety code provisions or
federal regulations governing sprinkler systems must receive reimbursement for the costs associated
with compliance if all of the following conditions are met:
   (1) the expenses associated with compliance occurred on or after January 1, 2005, and before
December 31, 2008;
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3487

   (2) the costs were not otherwise reimbursed under subdivision 4f or section 144A.071 or
144A.073; and
    (3) the total allowable costs reported under this paragraph are less than the minimum threshold
established under section 256B.431, subdivision 15, paragraph (e), and subdivision 16.
The commissioner shall use money appropriated for this purpose to provide to qualifying nursing
facilities a rate adjustment beginning October 1, 2007, and ending September 30, 2008. Nursing
facilities that have spent money or anticipate the need to spend money to satisfy the most recent life
safety code requirements by (1) installing a sprinkler system or (2) replacing all or portions of an
existing sprinkler system may submit to the commissioner by June 30, 2007, on a form provided by
the commissioner the actual costs of a completed project or the estimated costs, based on a project
bid, of a planned project. The commissioner shall calculate a rate adjustment equal to the allowable
costs of the project divided by the resident days reported for the report year ending September 30,
2006. If the costs from all projects exceed the appropriation for this purpose, the commissioner shall
allocate the money appropriated on a pro rata basis to the qualifying facilities by reducing the rate
adjustment determined for each facility by an equal percentage. Facilities that used estimated costs
when requesting the rate adjustment shall report to the commissioner by January 31, 2009, on the
use of this money on a form provided by the commissioner. If the nursing facility fails to provide the
report, the commissioner shall recoup the money paid to the facility for this purpose. If the facility
reports expenditures allowable under this subdivision that are less than the amount received in the
facility's annualized rate adjustment, the commissioner shall recoup the difference.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.434, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4j. Rate increase for facilities in Chisago County. Effective October 1, 2007, to
September 30, 2008, operating payment rates of all nursing facilities in Chisago County that are
reimbursed under this section or section 256B.441 shall be increased to be equal, for a RUG's
rate with a weight of 1.00, to the geographic group III median rate for the same RUG's weight.
The percentage of the operating payment rate for each facility to be case-mix adjusted shall be
equal to the percentage that is case-mix adjusted in that facility's September 30, 2007, operating
payment rate. This subdivision applies only if it results in a rate increase. Increases provided by this
subdivision shall be added to the rate determined under any new reimbursement system established
under section 256B.441.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.434, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19. Nursing facility rate increases beginning October 1, 2007. (a) For the rate
year beginning October 1, 2007, the commissioner shall make available to each nursing facility
reimbursed under this section operating payment rate adjustments equal to 2.87 percent of the
operating payment rates in effect on September 30, 2007.
   (b) Seventy-five percent of the money resulting from the rate adjustment under paragraph (a)
must be used for increases in compensation-related costs for employees directly employed by the
nursing facility on or after the effective date of the rate adjustment, except:
   (1) the administrator;
   (2) persons employed in the central office of a corporation that has an ownership interest in the
nursing facility or exercises control over the nursing facility; and
3488                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [63RD DAY

   (3) persons paid by the nursing facility under a management contract.
    (c) Two-thirds of the money available under paragraph (b) must be used for wage increases
for all employees directly employed by the nursing facility on or after the effective date of the
rate adjustment, except those listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3). The wage adjustment that
employees receive under this paragraph must be paid as an equal hourly percentage wage increase
for all eligible employees. Only costs associated with the portion of the equal hourly percentage
wage increase that goes to all employees shall qualify under this paragraph. Costs associated with
wage increases in excess of the amount of the equal hourly percentage wage increase provided to
all employees shall be allowed only for meeting the requirements in paragraph (b). This paragraph
shall not apply to:
     (1) employees eligible for a Taft-Hartley insurance plan established under United States Code,
title 29, section 186(c)(5); or
   (2) public employees.
   (d) The commissioner shall allow as compensation-related costs all costs for:
   (1) wages and salaries;
   (2) FICA taxes, Medicare taxes, state and federal unemployment taxes, and workers'
compensation;
   (3) the employer's share of health and dental insurance, life insurance, disability insurance,
long-term care insurance, uniform allowance, and pensions; and
   (4) other benefits provided, subject to the approval of the commissioner.
    (e) The portion of the rate adjustment under paragraph (a) that is not subject to the requirements
in paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be provided to nursing facilities effective October 1, 2007.
    (f) Nursing facilities may apply for the portion of the rate adjustment under paragraph (a) that
is subject to the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c). The application must be submitted to
the commissioner within six months of the effective date of the rate adjustment, and the nursing
facility must provide additional information required by the commissioner within nine months
of the effective date of the rate adjustment. The commissioner must respond to all applications
within three weeks of receipt. The commissioner may waive the deadlines in this paragraph under
extraordinary circumstances, to be determined at the sole discretion of the commissioner. The
application must contain:
   (1) an estimate of the amounts of money that must be used as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c);
    (2) a detailed distribution plan specifying the allowable compensation-related and wage
increases the nursing facility will implement to use the funds available in clause (1);
    (3) a description of how the nursing facility will notify eligible employees of the contents of the
approved application, which must provide for giving each eligible employee a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), or posting a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), for a period of at least six weeks in an
area of the nursing facility to which all eligible employees have access; and

   (4) instructions for employees who believe they have not received the compensation-related or
wage increases specified in clause (2), as approved by the commissioner, and which must include
a mailing address, e-mail address, and the telephone number that may be used by the employee to
contact the commissioner or the commissioner's representative.
    (g) The commissioner shall ensure that cost increases in distribution plans under paragraph (f),
clause (2), that may be included in approved applications, comply with the following requirements:
    (1) costs to be incurred during the applicable rate year resulting from wage and salary increases
effective prior to the first day of the nursing facility's payroll period that includes October 1, 2007,
shall be allowed if they were not used in a prior year's application;
   (2) a portion of the costs resulting from tenure-related wage or salary increases may be
considered to be allowable wage increases, according to formulas that the commissioner shall
provide, where employee retention is above the average statewide rate of retention of direct care
employees;
    (3) the annualized amount of increases in costs for the employer's share of health and dental
insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and workers' compensation shall be allowable
compensation-related increases if they are effective on or after April 1, 2007, and prior to April
1, 2008; and
    (4) for nursing facilities in which employees are represented by an exclusive bargaining
representative, the commissioner shall approve the application only upon receipt of a letter of
acceptance of the distribution plan, in regard to members of the bargaining unit, signed by the
exclusive bargaining agent and dated after enactment of this subdivision. Upon receipt of the letter
of acceptance, the commissioner shall deem all requirements of this section as having been met
in regard to the members of the bargaining unit.
    (h) The commissioner shall review applications received under paragraph (f) and shall provide
the portion of the rate adjustment under paragraphs (b) and (c) if the requirements of this subdivision
have been met. The rate adjustment shall be effective October 1. Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if
the approved application distributes less money than is available, the amount of the rate adjustment
shall be reduced so that the amount of money made available is equal to the amount to be distributed.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.434, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 20. Payment of Public Employees Retirement Association costs. Nursing facilities that
participate in the Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) shall have the component of
their payment rate associated with the costs of PERA determined for each rate year. Effective for rate
years beginning on and after October 1, 2007, the commissioner shall determine the portion of the
payment rate in effect on September 30 each year and shall subtract that amount from the payment
rate to be effective on the following October 1. The portion that shall be deemed to be included
in the September 30, 2007, rate that is associated with PERA costs shall be the allowed costs in
the facility's base for determining rates under this section, divided by the resident days reported for
that year. The commissioner shall add to the payment rate to be effective on October 1 each year
an amount equal to the reported costs associated with PERA, for the year ended on the most recent
September 30 for which data is available, divided by total resident days for that year, as reported by
the facility and audited under section 256B.441.

    Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.441, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 46a. Calculation of quality add-on for October 1, 2007. (a) The payment rate for the
rate year beginning October 1, 2007, for the quality add-on, is a variable amount based on each
facility's quality score. For the rate year, the maximum quality add-on is .3 percent of the operating
payment rate in effect on September 30, 2007. The commissioner shall determine the quality add-on
for each facility according to paragraphs (b) to (d).
   (b) For each facility, the commissioner shall determine the operating payment rate in effect on
September 30, 2007.
    (c) For each facility, the commissioner shall determine a ratio of the quality score of the facility
determined in subdivision 44, subtract 40, and then divide by 60. If this value is less than zero, the
commissioner shall use the value zero.
    (d) For each facility, the quality add-on is the value determined in paragraph (b), multiplied by
the value determined in paragraph (c), multiplied by .3 percent.

    Subd. 50. Determination of total care-related limit. (a) The limit on the total care-related
per diem shall be determined for each peer group and facility type group combination. A facility's
total care-related per diems shall be limited to 120 percent of the median for the facility's peer and
facility type group. The facility-specific direct care costs used in making this comparison and in the
calculation of the median shall be based on a RUG's weight of 1.00. A facility that is above that limit
shall have its total care-related per diem reduced to the limit. If a reduction of the total care-related
per diem is necessary because of this limit, the reduction shall be made proportionally to both the
direct care per diem and the other care-related per diem.
   (b) Beginning with rates determined for October 1, 2014, the total care-related limit shall be
a variable amount based on each facility's quality score, as determined under section 256B.441,
subdivision 44, in accordance with clauses (1) to (4):
    (1) for each facility, the commissioner shall determine the quality score, subtract 40, divide by
40, and convert to a percentage;
   (2) if the value determined in clause (1) is less than zero, the total care-related limit shall be 105
percent of the median for the facility's peer and facility type group;
   (3) if the value determined in clause (1) is greater than 100 percent, the total care-related limit
shall be 125 percent of the median for the facility's peer and facility type group; and
    (4) if the value determined in clause (1) is greater than zero and less than 100 percent, the total
care-related limit shall be 105 percent of the median for the facility's peer and facility type group
plus one-fifth of the percentage determined in clause (1).

and that has higher limits for care-related or other operating costs, the commissioner shall adjust the
limits in accordance with clauses (1) to (4):
   (1) determine the difference between the limits;
   (2) determine the distance between the two facilities, by the shortest driving route. If the distance
exceeds 20 miles, no adjustment shall be made;
   (3) subtract the value in clause (2) from 20 miles, divide by 20, and convert to a percentage; and
    (4) increase the limits for the nursing facility with the lower limits by the value determined in
clause (1) multiplied by the value determined in clause (3).

October 1, 2013, the commissioner may negotiate increases to the care-related limit for nursing
facilities that provide specialized care, at a cost to the general fund not to exceed $600,000 per year.
The commissioner shall publish a request for proposals annually, and may negotiate increases to
the limits that shall apply for either one or two years before the increase shall be subject to a new
proposal and negotiation. The care-related limit may be increased by up to 50 percent.
      (b) In selecting facilities with which to negotiate, the commissioner shall consider:
    (1) the diagnoses or other circumstances of residents in the specialized program that require care
that costs substantially more than the RUG's rates associated with those residents;
    (2) the nature of the specialized program or programs offered to meet the needs of these
individuals; and
      (3) outcomes achieved by the specialized program.

calculate a payment rate for external fixed costs.
    (a) For a facility licensed as a nursing home, the portion related to section 256.9657 shall be
equal to $8.86. For a facility licensed as both a nursing home and a boarding care home, the portion
related to section 256.9657 shall be equal to $8.86 multiplied by the result of its number of nursing
home beds divided by its total number of licensed beds.
  (b) The portion related to the licensure fee under section 144.122, paragraph (d), shall be the
amount of the fee divided by actual resident days.
      (c) The portion related to scholarships shall be determined under section 256B.431, subdivision
36.

    (b) A portion of the funds received under this subdivision that are in excess of operating
cost payment rates that a facility would have received under section 256B.434, as determined
in accordance with clauses (1) to (3), shall be subject to the requirements in section 256B.434,
subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h).
    (1) Determine the amount of additional funding available to a facility, which shall be equal
to total medical assistance resident days from the most recent reporting year times the difference
between the blended rate determined in paragraph (a) for the rate year being computed and the
blended rate for the prior year.
   (2) Determine the portion of all operating costs, for the most recent reporting year, that are
compensation related. If this value exceeds 75 percent, use 75 percent.
   (3) Subtract the amount determined in clause (2) from 75 percent.
    (4) The portion of the fund received under this subdivision that shall be subject to the
requirements in section 256B.434, subdivision 19, paragraphs (b) to (h), shall equal the amount
determined in clause (1) times the amount determined in clause (3).

the rate year beginning October 1, 2007, the commissioner shall make available to each facility
reimbursed under this section operating payment rate adjustments equal to 3.0 percent of the
operating payment rates in effect on September 30, 2007. For the rate year beginning October
1, 2008, the commissioner shall make available to each facility reimbursed under this section
operating payment rate adjustments equal to 3.0 percent of the operating payment rates in effect

based on occupied beds, using the percentage specified in this paragraph multiplied by the total
payment rate, including the variable rate but excluding the property-related payment rate, in effect
on the preceding day. The total payment rate shall include the adjustment provided in section
256B.501, subdivision 12. A facility whose payment rates are governed by closure agreements,
receivership agreements, or Minnesota Rules, part 9553.0075, is not eligible for an adjustment
otherwise granted under this subdivision.
    (b) Seventy-five percent of the money resulting from the rate adjustments under paragraph (a)
must be used for increases in compensation-related costs for employees directly employed by the
facility on or after the effective date of the rate adjustments, except:
   (1) the administrator;
    (2) persons employed in the central office of a corporation that has an ownership interest in the
facility or exercises control over the facility; and

all employees directly employed by the facility on or after the effective date of the rate adjustments,
except those listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3). The wage adjustment that employees receive
under this paragraph must be paid as an equal hourly percentage wage increase for all eligible
employees. Only costs associated with the portion of the equal hourly percentage wage increase
that goes to all employees shall qualify under this paragraph. Costs associated with wage increases
in excess of the amount of the equal hourly percentage wage increase provided to all employees
shall be allowed only for meeting the requirements in paragraph (b). This paragraph shall not apply

    (2) a detailed distribution plan specifying the allowable compensation-related and wage
increases the facility will implement to use the funds available in clause (1);
    (3) a description of how the facility will notify eligible employees of the contents of the
approved application, which must provide for giving each eligible employee a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), or posting a copy of the approved
application, excluding the information required in clause (1), for a period of at least six weeks in
an area of the facility to which all eligible employees have access; and
   (4) instructions for employees who believe they have not received the compensation-related or

insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and workers' compensation shall be allowable
compensation-related increases if they are effective on or after April 1 of the year in which the rate
adjustments are effective and prior to April 1 of the following year; and
    (4) for facilities in which employees are represented by an exclusive bargaining representative,
the commissioner shall approve the application only upon receipt of a letter of acceptance of the
distribution plan, as regards members of the bargaining unit, signed by the exclusive bargaining
agent and dated after enactment of this subdivision. Upon receipt of the letter of acceptance, the
commissioner shall deem all requirements of this section as having been met in regard to the
members of the bargaining unit.
    (h) The commissioner shall review applications received under paragraph (f) and shall
provide the portion of the rate adjustments under paragraphs (b) and (c) if the requirements of
this subdivision have been met. The rate adjustments shall be effective October 1 of each year.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a), if the approved application distributes less money than is available,
the amount of the rate adjustment shall be reduced so that the amount of money made available
is equal to the amount to be distributed.
   Sec. 68. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
63RD DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3503

purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning
July 1, 2003, and until ­wt­o
                            ­ four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor
participation in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term
care system providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and
in-home services to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver,
Hennepin, and Scott Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion
of the developmental disability pilot project. This paragraph expires ­w    t­o­ four years after the
implementation date of the pilot project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled

individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population

limited to the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated
MnDHO programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs
for home and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under the fee-for-service program. In developing program specifications
for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner shall involve and consult the state-level
stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph (d), including consultation on whether
and how to include home and community-based waiver programs. Plans for further expansion
of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the house and senate committees with
jurisdiction over health and human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.
   Sec. 69. [256C.261] SERVICES FOR DEAF-BLIND PERSONS.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall combine the existing biennial base level funding
for deaf-blind services into a single grant program. At least 35 percent of the total funding is awarded
for services and other supports to deaf-blind children and their families and at least 25 percent is
awarded for services and other supports to deaf-blind adults.
   The commissioner shall award grants for the purposes of:
   (1) providing services and supports to individuals who are deaf-blind; and
    (2) developing and providing training to counties and the network of senior citizen service
providers. The purpose of the training grants is to teach counties how to use existing programs
that capture federal financial participation to meet the needs of eligible deaf-blind persons and to
build capacity of senior service programs to meet the needs of seniors with a dual sensory hearing
and vision loss.
   (b) The commissioner may make grants:
   (1) for services and training provided by organizations; and
   (2) to develop and administer consumer-directed services.

       Sec. 70. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256I.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Moratorium on the development of group residential housing beds. (a) County
agencies shall not enter into agreements for new group residential housing beds with total rates
in excess of the MSA equivalent rate except: (1) for group residential housing establishments
licensed under Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0215 to 9525.0355, provided the facility is needed to
meet the census reduction targets for persons with developmental disabilities at regional treatment
centers; (2) to ensure compliance with the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act alternative
disposition plan requirements for inappropriately placed persons with developmental disabilities or
mental illness; (3) up to 80 beds in a single, specialized facility located in Hennepin County that
will provide housing for chronic inebriates who are repetitive users of detoxification centers and
are refused placement in emergency shelters because of their state of intoxication, and planning for
the specialized facility must have been initiated before July 1, 1991, in anticipation of receiving a
grant from the Housing Finance Agency under section 462A.05, subdivision 20a, paragraph (b);
(4) notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 2a, for up to 190 supportive housing units in
Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, or Ramsey County for homeless adults with a mental illness, a history
of substance abuse, or human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
For purposes of this section, "homeless adult" means a person who is living on the street or in a
shelter or discharged from a regional treatment center, community hospital, or residential treatment
program and has no appropriate housing available and lacks the resources and support necessary
to access appropriate housing. At least 70 percent of the supportive housing units must serve
homeless adults with mental illness, substance abuse problems, or human immunodeficiency virus
or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who are about to be or, within the previous six months,
has been discharged from a regional treatment center, or a state-contracted psychiatric bed in a
community hospital, or a residential mental health or chemical dependency treatment program. If
a person meets the requirements of subdivision 1, paragraph (a), and receives a federal or state
housing subsidy, the group residential housing rate for that person is limited to the supplementary
rate under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, and is determined by subtracting the amount of the
person's countable income that exceeds the MSA equivalent rate from the group residential
housing supplementary rate. A resident in a demonstration project site who no longer participates
in the demonstration program shall retain eligibility for a group residential housing payment in an
amount determined under section 256I.06, subdivision 8, using the MSA equivalent rate. Service
funding under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a, will end June 30, 1997, if federal matching funds
are available and the services can be provided through a managed care entity. If federal matching
funds are not available, then service funding will continue under section 256I.05, subdivision 1a;

waiver services under sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, subdivision 5, 256B.093, and 256B.49, and
who resided in a nursing facility for the six months immediately prior to the month of entry into
the group residential housing setting. The group residential housing rate for these beds must be set
so that the monthly group residential housing payment for an individual occupying the bed when
combined with the nonfederal share of services delivered under the waiver for that person does not

housing contract with the county and has been licensed as a board and lodge facility with special
services since 1980; (7) for a group residential housing provider located in Stearns County that
operates a 40-bed facility, that received financing through the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency
Ending Long-Term Homelessness Initiative and serves chemically dependent clientele, providing
24-hour-a-day supervision; and (8) for a new 65-bed facility in Crow Wing County that will serve
chemically dependent persons, operated by a group residential housing provider that currently
operates a 304-bed facility in Minneapolis, and a 44-bed facility in Duluth.
    (b) A county agency may enter into a group residential housing agreement for beds with rates in
excess of the MSA equivalent rate in addition to those currently covered under a group residential
housing agreement if the additional beds are only a replacement of beds with rates in excess of
the MSA equivalent rate which have been made available due to closure of a setting, a change of
licensure or certification which removes the beds from group residential housing payment, or as a
result of the downsizing of a group residential housing setting. The transfer of available beds from
one county to another can only occur by the agreement of both counties.

to address the underlying structural, financial, and organizational problems in Minnesota's mental
health system with the goal of improving the availability, quality, and accountability of mental health
care within the state.
   Subd. 2. General provisions. (a) In the design and implementation of reforms to the mental
health system, the commissioner shall:
    (1) consult with consumers, families, counties, tribes, advocates, providers, and other
stakeholders;
    (2) bring to the legislature, and the State Advisory Council on Mental Health, by January
15, 2008, recommendations for legislation to update the role of counties and to clarify the case
management roles, functions, and decision-making authority of health plans and counties, and to
clarify county retention of the responsibility for the delivery of social services as required under
subdivision 3, paragraph (a);
   (3) withhold implementation of any recommended changes in case management roles, functions,
and decision-making authority until after the release of the report due January 15, 2008;
   (4) ensure continuity of care for persons affected by these reforms including ensuring client
choice of provider by requiring broad provider networks and developing mechanisms to facilitate a
smooth transition of service responsibilities;
   (5) provide accountability for the efficient and effective use of public and private resources in
achieving positive outcomes for consumers;
   (6) ensure client access to applicable protections and appeals; and
    (7) make budget transfers necessary to implement the reallocation of services and client
responsibilities between counties and health care programs that do not increase the state and county
costs and efficiently allocate state funds.
    (b) When making transfers under paragraph (a) necessary to implement movement of
responsibility for clients and services between counties and health care programs, the commissioner,
in consultation with counties, shall ensure that any transfer of state grants to health care programs,
including the value of case management transfer grants under section 256B.0625, subdivision 20,
does not exceed the value of the services being transferred for the latest 12-month period for which
data is available. The commissioner may make quarterly adjustments based on the availability
of additional data during the first four quarters after the transfers first occur. If case management
transfer grants under section 256B.0625, subdivision 20, are repealed and the value, based on the
last year prior to repeal, exceeds the value of the services being transferred, the difference becomes
an ongoing part of each county's adult and children's mental health grants under sections 245.4661,
245.4889, and 256E.12.
   (c) This appropriation is not authorized to be expended after December 31, 2010, unless
approved by the legislature.
   Subd. 3. Projects for coordination of care. (a) Consistent with section 256B.69 and chapters
256D and 256L, the commissioner is authorized to solicit, approve, and implement up to three
projects to demonstrate the integration of physical and mental health services within prepaid health

plans and their coordination with social services. The commissioner shall require that each project
be based on locally defined partnerships that include at least one health maintenance organization,
community integrated service network, or accountable provider network authorized and operating
under chapter 62D, 62N, or 62T, or county-based purchasing entity under section 256B.692 that
is eligible to contract with the commissioner as a prepaid health plan, and the county or counties
within the service area. Counties shall retain responsibility and authority for social services in these
locally defined partnerships.
   (b) The commissioner, in consultation with consumers, families, and their representatives, shall:
    (1) determine criteria for approving the projects and use those criteria to solicit proposals for
preferred integrated networks. The commissioner must develop criteria to evaluate the partnership
proposed by the county and prepaid health plan to coordinate access and delivery of services. The
proposal must at a minimum address how the partnership will coordinate the provision of:
   (i) client outreach and identification of health and social service needs paired with expedited
access to appropriate resources;
   (ii) activities to maintain continuity of health care coverage;
   (iii) children's residential mental health treatment and treatment foster care;
   (iv) court-ordered assessments and treatments;
   (v) prepetition screening and commitments under chapter 253B;
   (vi) assessment and treatment of children identified through mental health screening of child
welfare and juvenile corrections cases;
   (vii) home and community-based waiver services;
   (viii) assistance with finding and maintaining employment;
   (ix) housing; and
   (x) transportation;
    (2) determine specifications for contracts with prepaid health plans to improve the plan's ability
to serve persons with mental health conditions, including specifications addressing:
   (i) early identification and intervention of physical and behavioral health problems;
   (ii) communication between the enrollee and the health plan;
    (iii) facilitation of enrollment for persons who are also eligible for a Medicare special needs plan
offered by the health plan;
   (iv) risk screening procedures;
   (v) health care coordination;
   (vi) member services and access to applicable protections and appeal processes;
   (vii) specialty provider networks;

   (viii) transportation services;
   (ix) treatment planning; and
   (x) administrative simplification for providers;
    (3) begin implementation of the projects no earlier than January 1, 2009, with not more than
40 percent of the statewide population included during calendar year 2009 and additional counties
included in subsequent years;
   (4) waive any administrative rule not consistent with the implementation of the projects;
   (5) allow potential bidders at least 90 days to respond to the request for proposals; and
    (6) conduct an independent evaluation to determine if mental health outcomes have improved in
that county or counties according to measurable standards designed in consultation with the advisory
body established under this subdivision and reviewed by the State Advisory Council on Mental
Health.
    (c) Notwithstanding any statute or administrative rule to the contrary, the commissioner may
enroll all persons eligible for medical assistance with serious mental illness or emotional disturbance
in the prepaid plan of their choice within the project service area unless:
   (1) the individual is eligible for home and community-based services for persons with
developmental disabilities and related conditions under section 256B.092; or
   (2) the individual has a basis for exclusion from the prepaid plan under section 256B.69,
subdivision 4, other than disability, mental illness, or emotional disturbance.
    (d) The commissioner shall involve organizations representing persons with mental illness and
their families in the development and distribution of information used to educate potential enrollees
regarding their options for health care and mental health service delivery under this subdivision.
    (e) If the person described in paragraph (c) does not elect to remain in fee-for-service medical
assistance, or declines to choose a plan, the commissioner may preferentially assign that person
to the prepaid plan participating in the preferred integrated network. The commissioner shall
implement the enrollment changes within a project's service area on the timeline specified in that
project's approved application.
    (f) A person enrolled in a prepaid health plan under paragraphs (c) and (d) may disenroll from
the plan at any time.
    (g) The commissioner, in consultation with consumers, families, and their representatives, shall
evaluate the projects begun in 2009, and shall refine the design of the service integration projects
before expanding the projects. The commissioner shall report to the chairs of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over mental health services by March 1, 2008, on plans for evaluation
of preferred integrated networks established under this subdivision.
   (h) The commissioner shall apply for any federal waivers necessary to implement these changes.
   (i) Payment for Medicaid service providers under this subdivision for the months of May and
June will be made no earlier than July 1 of the same calendar year.

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245.4712, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Availability of community support services. (a) County boards must provide
or contract for sufficient community support services within the county to meet the needs of adults
with serious and persistent mental illness who are residents of the county. Adults may be required to
pay a fee according to section 245.481. The community support services program must be designed

   (2) handle basic activities of daily living;
   (3) participate in leisure time activities;
   (4) set goals and plans; and

    The community support services program must also be designed to reduce the need for and use
of more intensive, costly, or restrictive placements both in number of admissions and length of stay.
   (b) Community support services are those services that are supportive in nature and not
necessarily treatment oriented, and include:
    (1) conducting outreach activities such as home visits, health and wellness checks, and problem

to prevent isolation and promote recovery; and
   (7) educating about mental illness, treatment, and recovery.
    (c) Community support services shall use all available funding streams. The county shall
maintain the level of expenditures for this program, as required under section 245.4835. County
boards must continue to provide funds for those services not covered by other funding streams and
to maintain an infrastructure to carry out these services.
    (d) The commissioner shall collect data on community support services programs, including,
but not limited to, demographic information such as age, sex, race, the number of people served,
and information related to housing, employment, hospitalization, symptoms, and satisfaction with
services.

professional. The court or county agency must notify a parent or guardian whose parental rights
have not been terminated of the potential mental health screening and the option to prevent the
screening by notifying the court or county agency in writing. The screening shall be conducted
with a screening instrument approved by the commissioner of human services according to criteria
that are updated and issued annually to ensure that approved screening instruments are valid and
useful for child welfare and juvenile justice populations, and shall be conducted by a mental health
practitioner as defined in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer or local social
services agency staff person who is trained in the use of the screening instrument. Training in the
use of the instrument shall include training in the administration of the instrument, the interpretation
of its validity given the child's current circumstances, the state and federal data practices laws and
confidentiality standards, the parental consent requirement, and providing respect for families and
cultural values. If the screen indicates a need for assessment, the child's family, or if the family lacks
mental health insurance, the local social services agency, in consultation with the child's family, shall
have conducted a diagnostic assessment, including a functional assessment, as defined in section
245.4871. The administration of the screening shall safeguard the privacy of children receiving the
screening and their families and shall comply with the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act,
chapter 13, and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law
104-191. Screening results shall be considered private data and the commissioner shall not collect
individual screening results.
   (b) When the county board refers clients to providers of children's therapeutic services and
supports under section 256B.0943, the county board must clearly identify the desired services
components not covered under section 256B.0943 and identify the reimbursement source for those
requested services, the method of payment, and the payment rate to the provider.

organization shall submit an application and budget for the use of the money in the form specified
by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make grants only to entities whose applications
and budgets are approved by the commissioner. In awarding grants, the commissioner shall give
priority to applications that indicate plans to collaborate in the development, funding, and delivery
of services with other agencies in the local system of care. The commissioner shall specify
requirements for reports, including quarterly fiscal reports under section 256.01, subdivision 2,
paragraph (q). The commissioner shall require collection of data and periodic reports that the

    Subd. 5. Special contracts; bordering states. (a) An individual who is detained, committed, or
placed on an involuntary basis under chapter 253B may be confined or treated in a bordering state
pursuant to a contract under this section. An individual who is detained, committed, or placed on an
involuntary basis under the civil law of a bordering state may be confined or treated in Minnesota
pursuant to a contract under this section. A peace or health officer who is acting under the authority
of the sending state may transport an individual to a receiving agency that provides services pursuant
to a contract under this section and may transport the individual back to the sending state under the
laws of the sending state. Court orders valid under the law of the sending state are granted recognition
and reciprocity in the receiving state for individuals covered by a contract under this section to the
extent that the court orders relate to confinement for treatment or care of mental illness or chemical
dependency. Such treatment or care may address other conditions that may be co-occurring with
the mental illness or chemical dependency. These court orders are not subject to legal challenge in
the courts of the receiving state. Individuals who are detained, committed, or placed under the law
of a sending state and who are transferred to a receiving state under this section continue to be in
the legal custody of the authority responsible for them under the law of the sending state. Except
in emergencies, those individuals may not be transferred, removed, or furloughed from a receiving
agency without the specific approval of the authority responsible for them under the law of the
sending state.
    (b) While in the receiving state pursuant to a contract under this section, an individual shall be
subject to the sending state's laws and rules relating to length of confinement, reexaminations, and
extensions of confinement. No individual may be sent to another state pursuant to a contract under
this section until the receiving state has enacted a law recognizing the validity and applicability of
this section.
    (c) If an individual receiving services pursuant to a contract under this section leaves the
receiving agency without permission and the individual is subject to involuntary confinement
under the law of the sending state, the receiving agency shall use all reasonable means to return
the individual to the receiving agency. The receiving agency shall immediately report the absence
to the sending agency. The receiving state has the primary responsibility for, and the authority to
direct, the return of these individuals within its borders and is liable for the cost of the action to the
extent that it would be liable for costs of its own resident.

examiner under sections 253B.07, 253B.08, 253B.092, 253B.12, and 253B.17 subject to the same
requirements and limitations in section 253B.02, subdivision 7.

    Subd. 2. Program. The commissioner of human services shall establish a program for the
treatment of compulsive gamblers. The commissioner may contract with an entity with expertise

the establishment of a statewide toll-free number, resource library, public education programs;
regional in-service training programs and conferences for health care professionals, educators,
treatment providers, employee assistance programs, and criminal justice representatives; and the
establishment of certification standards for programs and service providers. The commissioner
may enter into agreements with other entities and may employ or contract with consultants to
facilitate the provision of these services or the training of individuals to qualify them to provide
these services. The program may also include inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation
services ­an­d
             ­ for residents in different settings, including a temporary or permanent residential
setting for mental health or chemical dependency, and individuals in jails or correctional facilities.
The program may also include research studies. The research studies must include baseline and
prevalence studies for adolescents and adults to identify those at the highest risk. The program
must be approved by the commissioner before it is established.
    Sec. 11. [245A.175] MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING REQUIREMENT.
    Prior to nonemergency placement of a child in a foster care home, the child foster care provider,
licensed after July 1, 2007, must complete two hours of training that addresses the causes, symptoms,
and key warning signs of mental health disorders; cultural considerations; and effective approaches

for county-provided services. In this case, the contracted vendor, the tribal agency, and the county
may each receive separate payment for services provided by each entity in the same month. In order
to prevent duplication of services, each entity must document, in the recipient's file, the need for
team case management and a description of the roles of the team members.

health case management shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility, as defined in
sections 256G.01 to 256G.12, from sources other than federal funds or funds used to match other
federal funds. If the service is provided by a tribal agency, the nonfederal share, if any, shall be
provided by the recipient's tribe. When this service is paid by the state without a federal share through
fee-for-service, 50 percent of the cost shall be provided by the recipient's county of responsibility.
    (i) Notwithstanding any administrative rule to the contrary, prepaid medical assistance, general
assistance medical care, and MinnesotaCare include mental health case management. When the
service is provided through prepaid capitation, the nonfederal share is paid by the state and the
county pays no share.

medical expenses other than the nursing facility per diem expense;
   (5) recipients who receive benefits under the Refugee Assistance Program, established under
United States Code, title 8, section 1522(e);
    (6) children who are both determined to be severely emotionally disturbed and receiving case
management services according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 20, except children who are
eligible for and who decline enrollment in an approved preferred integrated network under section
245.4682;
   (7) adults who are both determined to be seriously and persistently mentally ill and received
case management services according to section 256B.0625, subdivision 20;
   (8) persons eligible for medical assistance according to section 256B.057, subdivision 10; and
    (9) persons with access to cost-effective employer-sponsored private health insurance or
persons enrolled in a non-Medicare individual health plan determined to be cost-effective according
to section 256B.0625, subdivision 15.
Children under age 21 who are in foster placement may enroll in the project on an elective basis.
Individuals excluded under clauses (1), (6), and (7) may choose to enroll on an elective basis. The
commissioner may enroll recipients in the prepaid medical assistance program for seniors who are
(1) age 65 and over, and (2) eligible for medical assistance by spending down excess income.
    (c) The commissioner may allow persons with a one-month spenddown who are otherwise
eligible to enroll to voluntarily enroll or remain enrolled, if they elect to prepay their monthly
spenddown to the state.

program who otherwise would have been excluded under paragraph (b), clauses (1), (3), and (8),

    (e) Before limitation of choice is implemented, eligible individuals shall be notified and after
notification, shall be allowed to choose only among demonstration providers. The commissioner
may assign an individual with private coverage through a health maintenance organization, to the
same health maintenance organization for medical assistance coverage, if the health maintenance
organization is under contract for medical assistance in the individual's county of residence. After
initially choosing a provider, the recipient is allowed to change that choice only at specified times as
allowed by the commissioner. If a demonstration provider ends participation in the project for any
reason, a recipient enrolled with that provider must select a new provider but may change providers
without cause once more within the first 60 days after enrollment with the second provider.
    (f) An infant born to a woman who is eligible for and receiving medical assistance and who is
enrolled in the prepaid medical assistance program shall be retroactively enrolled to the month of
birth in the same managed care plan as the mother once the child is enrolled in medical assistance
unless the child is determined to be excluded from enrollment in a prepaid plan under this section.

    (ii) Effective October 1, 2003, for a person who is eligible under subdivision 3, paragraph (a),
clause (2), item (ii), general assistance medical care coverage is limited to inpatient hospital services,
including physician services provided during the inpatient hospital stay. A $1,000 deductible is
required for each inpatient hospitalization.
    (b) Effective August 1, 2005, sex reassignment surgery is not covered under this subdivision.
    (c) In order to contain costs, the commissioner of human services shall select vendors of
medical care who can provide the most economical care consistent with high medical standards
and shall where possible contract with organizations on a prepaid capitation basis to provide these
services. The commissioner shall consider proposals by counties and vendors for prepaid health
plans, competitive bidding programs, block grants, or other vendor payment mechanisms designed
to provide services in an economical manner or to control utilization, with safeguards to ensure that
necessary services are provided. Before implementing prepaid programs in counties with a county
operated or affiliated public teaching hospital or a hospital or clinic operated by the University of
Minnesota, the commissioner shall consider the risks the prepaid program creates for the hospital
and allow the county or hospital the opportunity to participate in the program in a manner that
reflects the risk of adverse selection and the nature of the patients served by the hospital, provided
the terms of participation in the program are competitive with the terms of other participants
considering the nature of the population served. Payment for services provided pursuant to this
subdivision shall be as provided to medical assistance vendors of these services under sections
256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625. For payments made during fiscal year 1990 and later
63RD DAY]                            MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                        3537

years, the commissioner shall consult with an independent actuary in establishing prepayment
rates, but shall retain final control over the rate methodology.
    (d) Recipients eligible under subdivision 3, paragraph (a), shall pay the following co-payments
for services provided on or after October 1, 2003:
   (1) $25 for eyeglasses;
   (2) $25 for nonemergency visits to a hospital-based emergency room;
   (3) $3 per brand-name drug prescription and $1 per generic drug prescription, subject to a $12 per
month maximum for prescription drug co-payments. No co-payments shall apply to antipsychotic
drugs when used for the treatment of mental illness; and
   (4) 50 percent coinsurance on restorative dental services.
    (e) Co-payments shall be limited to one per day per provider for nonpreventive visits, eyeglasses,
and nonemergency visits to a hospital-based emergency room. Recipients of general assistance
medical care are responsible for all co-payments in this subdivision. The general assistance medical
care reimbursement to the provider shall be reduced by the amount of the co-payment, except that
reimbursement for prescription drugs shall not be reduced once a recipient has reached the $12 per
month maximum for prescription drug co-payments. The provider collects the co-payment from
the recipient. Providers may not deny services to recipients who are unable to pay the co-payment,
except as provided in paragraph (f).
   (f) If it is the routine business practice of a provider to refuse service to an individual with
uncollected debt, the provider may include uncollected co-payments under this section. A provider
must give advance notice to a recipient with uncollected debt before services can be denied.
    (g) Any county may, from its own resources, provide medical payments for which state payments
are not made.
    (h) Chemical dependency services that are reimbursed under chapter 254B must not be
reimbursed under general assistance medical care.
   (i) The maximum payment for new vendors enrolled in the general assistance medical care
program after the base year shall be determined from the average usual and customary charge of the
same vendor type enrolled in the base year.
   (j) The conditions of payment for services under this subdivision are the same as the conditions
specified in rules adopted under chapter 256B governing the medical assistance program, unless
otherwise provided by statute or rule.
   (k) Inpatient and outpatient payments shall be reduced by five percent, effective July 1, 2003.
This reduction is in addition to the five percent reduction effective July 1, 2003, and incorporated
by reference in paragraph (i).
   (l) Payments for all other health services except inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy services
shall be reduced by five percent, effective July 1, 2003.
    (m) Payments to managed care plans shall be reduced by five percent for services provided on
or after October 1, 2003.

    (n) A hospital receiving a reduced payment as a result of this section may apply the unpaid
balance toward satisfaction of the hospital's bad debts.
    (o) Fee-for-service payments for nonpreventive visits shall be reduced by $3 for services
provided on or after January 1, 2006. For purposes of this subdivision, a visit means an episode

   Each hospital, outpatient surgical center, diagnostic imaging center, and physician clinic shall
report annually to the commissioner on all major spending commitments, in the form and manner
specified by the commissioner. The report shall include the following information:
    (a) a description of major spending commitments made during the previous year, including the
total dollar amount of major spending commitments and purpose of the expenditures;
    (b) the cost of land acquisition, construction of new facilities, and renovation of existing
facilities;
     (c) the cost of purchased or leased medical equipment, by type of equipment;
     (d) expenditures by type for specialty care and new specialized services;
   (e) information on the amount and types of added capacity for diagnostic imaging services,
outpatient surgical services, and new specialized services; and
     (f) information on investments in electronic medical records systems.
For hospitals and outpatient surgical centers, this information shall be included in reports to
the commissioner that are required under section 144.698. For diagnostic imaging centers, this
information shall be included in reports to the commissioner that are required under section
144.565. For physician clinics, this information shall be included in reports to the commissioner
that are required under section 62J.41. For all other health care providers that are subject to this
reporting requirement, reports must be submitted to the commissioner by March 1 each year for
the preceding calendar year.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.17, subdivision 6a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6a. Prospective review and approval. (a) No health care provider subject to prospective
review under this subdivision shall make a major spending commitment unless:
    (1) the provider has filed an application with the commissioner to proceed with the major
spending commitment and has provided all supporting documentation and evidence requested by
the commissioner; and
    (2) the commissioner determines, based upon this documentation and evidence, that the major
spending commitment is appropriate under the criteria provided in subdivision 5a in light of the
alternatives available to the provider.
      (b) A provider subject to prospective review and approval shall submit an application to the
commissioner before proceeding with any major spending commitment. T                                            ­h­­  ­­

facility, that entity must report by individual facility. Reports must include only services that
were billed by the provider of diagnostic imaging services submitting the report. If a diagnostic
imaging facility leases capacity, technical services, or professional services to one or more other
providers of diagnostic imaging services, each provider must submit a separate annual report to
the commissioner for all diagnostic imaging services that it provided and billed. The owner of the
leased capacity must provide a report listing the names and addresses of providers to whom the
diagnostic imaging services and equipment were leased.

  Sec. 15. [144.585] METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
CONTROL PROGRAMS.
    In order to improve the prevention of hospital-associated infections due to methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus ("MRSA"), every hospital shall establish an MRSA control program that
meets Minnesota Department of Health MRSA recommendations as published January 15, 2008.
In developing the MRSA recommendations, the Department of Health shall consider the following
63RD DAY]                              MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                           3557

infection control practices:
   (1) identification of MRSA-colonized patients in all intensive care units, or other at-risk patients
identified by the hospital;
  (2) isolation of identified MRSA-colonized or MRSA-infected patients in an appropriate
manner;
   (3) adherence to hand hygiene requirements; and
    (4) monitor trends in the incidence of MRSA in the hospital over time and modify interventions
if MRSA infection rates do not decrease.
The Department of Health shall review the MRSA recommendations on an annual basis and revise
the recommendations as necessary, in accordance with available scientific data.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.651, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Information about treatment. Patients and residents shall be given by their
physicians complete and current information concerning their diagnosis, treatment, alternatives,
risks, and prognosis as required by the physician's legal duty to disclose. This information shall be
in terms and language the patients or residents can reasonably be expected to understand. Patients
and residents may be accompanied by a family member or other chosen representative, or both.
This information shall include the likely medical or major psychological results of the treatment
and its alternatives. In cases where it is medically inadvisable, as documented by the attending
physician in a patient's or resident's medical record, the information shall be given to the patient's
or resident's guardian or other person designated by the patient or resident as a representative.
Individuals have the right to refuse this information.
    Every patient or resident suffering from any form of breast cancer shall be fully informed, prior
to or at the time of admission and during her stay, of all alternative effective methods of treatment of
which the treating physician is knowledgeable, including surgical, radiological, or chemotherapeutic
treatments or combinations of treatments and the risks associated with each of those methods.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.651, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Participation in planning treatment; notification of family members. (a) Patients
and residents shall have the right to participate in the planning of their health care. This right includes
the opportunity to discuss treatment and alternatives with individual caregivers, the opportunity to
request and participate in formal care conferences, and the right to include a family member or
other chosen representative, or both. In the event that the patient or resident cannot be present, a
family member or other representative chosen by the patient or resident may be included in such
conferences. A chosen representative may include a doula of the patient's choice.
    (b) If a patient or resident who enters a facility is unconscious or comatose or is unable to
communicate, the facility shall make reasonable efforts as required under paragraph (c) to notify
either a family member or a person designated in writing by the patient as the person to contact in
an emergency that the patient or resident has been admitted to the facility. The facility shall allow
the family member to participate in treatment planning, unless the facility knows or has reason to
believe the patient or resident has an effective advance directive to the contrary or knows the patient
or resident has specified in writing that they do not want a family member included in treatment
3558                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [63RD DAY

planning. After notifying a family member but prior to allowing a family member to participate in
treatment planning, the facility must make reasonable efforts, consistent with reasonable medical
practice, to determine if the patient or resident has executed an advance directive relative to the
patient or resident's health care decisions. For purposes of this paragraph, "reasonable efforts"
include:
   (1) examining the personal effects of the patient or resident;
   (2) examining the medical records of the patient or resident in the possession of the facility;
    (3) inquiring of any emergency contact or family member contacted under this section whether
the patient or resident has executed an advance directive and whether the patient or resident has a
physician to whom the patient or resident normally goes for care; and
    (4) inquiring of the physician to whom the patient or resident normally goes for care, if known,
whether the patient or resident has executed an advance directive. If a facility notifies a family
member or designated emergency contact or allows a family member to participate in treatment
planning in accordance with this paragraph, the facility is not liable to the patient or resident for
damages on the grounds that the notification of the family member or emergency contact or the
participation of the family member was improper or violated the patient's privacy rights.
    (c) In making reasonable efforts to notify a family member or designated emergency contact, the
facility shall attempt to identify family members or a designated emergency contact by examining
the personal effects of the patient or resident and the medical records of the patient or resident
in the possession of the facility. If the facility is unable to notify a family member or designated
emergency contact within 24 hours after the admission, the facility shall notify the county social
service agency or local law enforcement agency that the patient or resident has been admitted and
the facility has been unable to notify a family member or designated emergency contact. The county
social service agency and local law enforcement agency shall assist the facility in identifying and
notifying a family member or designated emergency contact. A county social service agency or
local law enforcement agency that assists a facility in implementing this subdivision is not liable
to the patient or resident for damages on the grounds that the notification of the family member or
emergency contact or the participation of the family member was improper or violated the patient's
privacy rights.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.651, subdivision 26, is amended to read:
    Subd. 26. Right to associate. (a) Residents may meet with and receive visitors and participate in
activities of commercial, religious, political, as defined in section 203B.11 and community groups
without interference at their discretion if the activities do not infringe on the right to privacy of other
residents or are not programmatically contraindicated. This includes:
   (1) the right to join with other individuals within and outside the facility to work for
improvements in long-term care;
   (2) the right to visitation by an individual the patient has appointed as the patient's health care
agent under chapter 145C;
    (3) the right to visitation and health care decision making by an individual designated by the
patient under paragraph (c).
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                          3559

    (b) Upon admission to a facility where federal law prohibits unauthorized disclosure of patient or
resident identifying information to callers and visitors, the patient or resident, or the legal guardian
or conservator of the patient or resident, shall be given the opportunity to authorize disclosure of the
patient's or resident's presence in the facility to callers and visitors who may seek to communicate
with the patient or resident. To the extent possible, the legal guardian or conservator of a patient or
resident shall consider the opinions of the patient or resident regarding the disclosure of the patient's
or resident's presence in the facility.
    (c) Upon admission to a facility, the patient or resident, or the legal guardian or conservator of
the patient or resident, must be given the opportunity to designate a person who is not related who
will have the status of the patient's next of kin with respect to visitation and making a health care
decision. A designation must be included in the patient's health record. With respect to making a
health care decision, a health care directive or appointment of a health care agent under chapter 145C
prevails over a designation made under this paragraph. The unrelated person may also be identified
as such by the patient or by the patient's family.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 145C.05, is amended to read:
   145C.05 SUGGESTED FORM; PROVISIONS THAT MAY BE INCLUDED.
    Subdivision 1. Content. A health care directive executed pursuant to this chapter may, but need
not, be in the form contained in section 145C.16.
   Subd. 2. Provisions that may be included. (a) A health care directive may include provisions
consistent with this chapter, including, but not limited to:
   (1) the designation of one or more alternate health care agents to act if the named health care
agent is not reasonably available to serve;
    (2) directions to joint health care agents regarding the process or standards by which the health
care agents are to reach a health care decision for the principal, and a statement whether joint health
care agents may act independently of one another;
    (3) limitations, if any, on the right of the health care agent or any alternate health care agents to
receive, review, obtain copies of, and consent to the disclosure of the principal's medical records or
to visit the principal when the principal is a patient in a health care facility;
    (4) limitations, if any, on the nomination of the health care agent as guardian for purposes of
sections 524.5-202, 524.5-211, 524.5-302, and 524.5-303;
   (5) a document of gift for the purpose of making an anatomical gift, as set forth in sections
525.921 to 525.9224, or an amendment to, revocation of, or refusal to make an anatomical gift;
    (6) a declaration regarding intrusive mental health treatment under section 253B.03, subdivision
6d, or a statement that the health care agent is authorized to give consent for the principal under
section 253B.04, subdivision 1a;
   (7) a funeral directive as provided in section 149A.80, subdivision 2;
   (8) limitations, if any, to the effect of dissolution or annulment of marriage or termination of

   (9) specific reasons why a principal wants a health care provider or an employee of a health care
provider attending the principal to be eligible to act as the principal's health care agent;
   (10) health care instructions by a woman of child bearing age regarding how she would like her
pregnancy, if any, to affect health care decisions made on her behalf; and
   (11) health care instructions regarding artificially administered nutrition or hydration.
    (b) A health care directive may include a statement of the circumstances under which the
directive becomes effective other than upon the judgment of the principal's attending physician in
the following situations:
    (1) a principal who in good faith generally selects and depends upon spiritual means or prayer
for the treatment or care of disease or remedial care and does not have an attending physician, may
include a statement appointing an individual who may determine the principal's decision-making
capacity; and
    (2) a principal who in good faith does not generally select a physician or a health care facility
for the principal's health care needs may include a statement appointing an individual who may
determine the principal's decision-making capacity, provided that if the need to determine the
principal's capacity arises when the principal is receiving care under the direction of an attending
physician in a health care facility, the determination must be made by an attending physician after
consultation with the appointed individual.
    If a person appointed under clause (1) or (2) is not reasonably available and the principal is
receiving care under the direction of an attending physician in a health care facility, an attending
physician shall determine the principal's decision-making capacity.
    (c) A health care directive may authorize a health care agent to make health care decisions for a
principal even though the principal retains decision-making capacity.
   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 145C.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Visitation. A health care agent may visit the principal when the principal is a patient in
a health care facility regardless of whether the principal retains decision-making capacity, unless:
   (1) the principal has otherwise specified in the health care directive;
   (2) a principal who retains decision-making capacity indicates otherwise; or
    (3) a health care provider reasonably determines that the principal must be isolated from all
visitors or that the presence of the health care agent would endanger the health or safety of the
principal, other patients, or the facility in which the care is being provided.
   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 148.6445, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

or for a lesser period specified in the consent or for a different period provided by law.
   Subd. 5. Exceptions to consent requirement. This section does not prohibit the release of health

informed consent to the release of health records for the purposes and restrictions in clauses (1) and
(2), the consent does not expire after one year for:
   (1) the release of health records to a provider who is being advised or consulted with in
connection with the releasing provider's current treatment of the patient;
    (2) the release of health records to an accident and health insurer, health service plan corporation,
health maintenance organization, or third-party administrator for purposes of payment of claims,
fraud investigation, or quality of care review and studies, provided that:
   (i) the use or release of the records complies with sections 72A.49 to 72A.505;
    (ii) further use or release of the records in individually identifiable form to a person other than
the patient without the patient's consent is prohibited; and
    (iii) the recipient establishes adequate safeguards to protect the records from unauthorized
disclosure, including a procedure for removal or destruction of information that identifies the
patient.
    Subd. 7. Exception to consent. Subdivision 2 does not apply to the release of health records
to the commissioner of health or the Health Data Institute under chapter 62J, provided that the
commissioner encrypts the patient identifier upon receipt of the data.
    Subd. 8. Record locator service. (a) A provider or group purchaser may release patient
identifying information and information about the location of the patient's health records to a record
locator service without consent from the patient, unless the patient has elected to be excluded
from the service under paragraph (d). The Department of Health may not access the record locator
service or receive data from the record locator service. Only a provider may have access to patient
identifying information in a record locator service. Except in the case of a medical emergency, a
provider participating in a health information exchange using a record locator service does not have
access to patient identifying information and information about the location of the patient's health
records unless the patient specifically consents to the access. A consent does not expire but may be
revoked by the patient at any time by providing written notice of the revocation to the provider.
    (b) A health information exchange maintaining a record locator service must maintain an audit
log of providers accessing information in a record locator service that at least contains information
on:
   (1) the identity of the provider accessing the information;
   (2) the identity of the patient whose information was accessed by the provider; and
   (3) the date the information was accessed.
    (c) No group purchaser may in any way require a provider to participate in a record locator
service as a condition of payment or participation.
    (d) A provider or an entity operating a record locator service must provide a mechanism under
which patients may exclude their identifying information and information about the location of their
health records from a record locator service. At a minimum, a consent form that permits a provider
to access a record locator service must include a conspicuous check-box option that allows a patient
to exclude all of the patient's information from the record locator service. A provider participating

    (14) consistent with section 245.486, arrange for or provide a children's mental health screening
to a child receiving child protective services or a child in out-of-home placement, a child for whom
parental rights have been terminated, a child found to be delinquent, and a child found to have

in consultation with the child's family, shall have conducted a diagnostic assessment, including a
functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871. The administration of the screening shall
safeguard the privacy of children receiving the screening and their families and shall comply

allocation under section 254B.09, subdivisions 4 and 5. The commissioner shall annually divide the
money available in the chemical dependency fund that is not held in reserve by counties from a
previous allocation, or allocated to the American Indian chemical dependency tribal account. Six
percent of the remaining money must be reserved for the nonreservation American Indian chemical
dependency allocation for treatment of American Indians by eligible vendors under section 254B.05,
subdivision 1. The remainder of the money must be allocated among the counties according to
the following formula, using state demographer data and other data sources determined by the
commissioner:
   (a) For purposes of this formula, American Indians and children under age 14 are subtracted
from the population of each county to determine the restricted population.
    (b) The amount of chemical dependency fund expenditures for entitled persons for services not
covered by prepaid plans governed by section 256B.69 in the previous year is divided by the amount
of chemical dependency fund expenditures for entitled persons for all services to determine the
proportion of exempt service expenditures for each county.
   (c) The prepaid plan months of eligibility is multiplied by the proportion of exempt service
expenditures to determine the adjusted prepaid plan months of eligibility for each county.
    (d) The adjusted prepaid plan months of eligibility is added to the number of restricted
population fee for service months of eligibility for the Minnesota family investment program,
general assistance, and medical assistance and divided by the county restricted population to
determine county per capita months of covered service eligibility.
     (e) The number of adjusted prepaid plan months of eligibility for the state is added to the

number of fee for service months of eligibility for the Minnesota family investment program,
general assistance, and medical assistance for the state restricted population and divided by the
state restricted population to determine state per capita months of covered service eligibility.
  (f) The county per capita months of covered service eligibility is divided by the state per capita
months of covered service eligibility to determine the county welfare caseload factor.
    (g) The median married couple income for the most recent three-year period available for
the state is divided by the median married couple income for the same period for each county to
determine the income factor for each county.
    (h) The county restricted population is multiplied by the sum of the county welfare caseload
factor and the county income factor to determine the adjusted population.
      (i) $15,000 shall be allocated to each county.
      (j) The remaining funds shall be allocated proportional to the county adjusted population.
      Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 254B.02, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
     Subd. 5. Administrative adjustment. The commissioner may make payments to local agencies
from money allocated under this section to support administrative activities under sections 254B.03

     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 254B.03, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Local agency duties. (a) Every local agency shall provide chemical dependency
services to persons residing within its jurisdiction who meet criteria established by the commissioner
for placement in a chemical dependency residential or nonresidential treatment service. Chemical
dependency money must be administered by the local agencies according to law and rules adopted
by the commissioner under sections 14.001 to 14.69.
    (b) In order to contain costs, the county board shall, with the approval of the commissioner
of human services, select eligible vendors of chemical dependency services who can provide
economical and appropriate treatment. Unless the local agency is a social services department
directly administered by a county or human services board, the local agency shall not be an eligible
vendor under section 254B.05. The commissioner may approve proposals from county boards to
provide services in an economical manner or to control utilization, with safeguards to ensure that
necessary services are provided. If a county implements a demonstration or experimental medical
services funding plan, the commissioner shall transfer the money as appropriate. If a county selects
a vendor located in another state, the county shall ensure that the vendor is in compliance with the
rules governing licensure of programs located in the state.

      Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 254B.06, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Payment; denial. The commissioner shall pay eligible vendors for placements made by
local agencies under section 254B.03, subdivision 1, and placements by tribal designated agencies
according to section 254B.09. The commissioner may reduce or deny payment of the state share
when services are not provided according to the placement criteria established by the commissioner.
The commissioner may pay for all or a portion of improper county chemical dependency placements
and bill the county for the entire payment made when the placement did not comply with criteria
established by the commissioner. The commissioner may make payments to vendors and charge the
county 100 percent of the payments if documentation of a county approved placement is received
more than 30 working days, exclusive of weekends and holidays, after the date services began;                  ­­o

    Subd. 6. Provider entity clinical infrastructure requirements. (a) To be an eligible provider
entity under this section, a provider entity must have a clinical infrastructure that utilizes diagnostic
assessment, an individualized treatment plan, service delivery, and individual treatment plan review
that are culturally competent, child-centered, and family-driven to achieve maximum benefit for the
client. The provider entity must review and update the clinical policies and procedures every three
years and must distribute the policies and procedures to staff initially and upon each subsequent

update.
   (b) The clinical infrastructure written policies and procedures must include policies and
procedures for:
    (1) providing or obtaining a client's diagnostic assessment that identifies acute and chronic
clinical disorders, co-occurring medical conditions, sources of psychological and environmental
problems, and a functional assessment. The functional assessment must clearly summarize the
client's individual strengths and needs;
   (2) developing an individual treatment plan that is:
   (i) based on the information in the client's diagnostic assessment;
    (ii) developed no later than the end of the first psychotherapy session after the completion
of the client's diagnostic assessment by the mental health professional who provides the client's
psychotherapy;
    (iii) developed through a child-centered, family-driven planning process that identifies service
needs and individualized, planned, and culturally appropriate interventions that contain specific
treatment goals and objectives for the client and the client's family or foster family;
   (iv) reviewed at least once every 90 days and revised, if necessary; and
    (v) signed by the client or, if appropriate, by the client's parent or other person authorized by
statute to consent to mental health services for the client;
   (3) developing an individual behavior plan that documents services to be provided by the mental
health behavioral aide. The individual behavior plan must include:
   (i) detailed instructions on the service to be provided;
   (ii) time allocated to each service;
   (iii) methods of documenting the child's behavior;
   (iv) methods of monitoring the child's progress in reaching objectives; and
   (v) goals to increase or decrease targeted behavior as identified in the individual treatment plan;
    (4) clinical supervision of the mental health practitioner and mental health behavioral aide.
A mental health professional must document the clinical supervision the professional provides
by cosigning individual treatment plans and making entries in the client's record on supervisory
activities. Clinical supervision does not include the authority to make or terminate court-ordered
placements of the child. A clinical supervisor must be available for urgent consultation as required
by the individual client's needs or the situation. Clinical supervision may occur individually or
in a small group to discuss treatment and review progress toward goals. The focus of clinical
supervision must be the client's treatment needs and progress and the mental health practitioner's
or behavioral aide's ability to provide services;
    (4a) CTSS certified provider entities providing day treatment programs must meet the conditions
in items (i) to (iii):

supervisor; and
    (iii) every 30 days, the supervisor must review and sign the record of the client's care for all
activities in the preceding 30-day period;
     (4b) for all other services provided under CTSS, clinical supervision standards provided in items
(i) to (iii) must be used:
    (i) medical assistance shall reimburse a mental health practitioner who maintains a consulting
relationship with a mental health professional who accepts full professional responsibility and is
present on site for at least one observation during the first 12 hours in which the mental health
practitioner provides the individual, family, or group skills training to the child or the child's family;
    (ii) thereafter, the mental health professional is required to be present on site for observation as
clinically appropriate when the mental health practitioner is providing individual, family, or group
skills training to the child or the child's family; and
   (iii) the observation must be a minimum of one clinical unit. The on-site presence of the mental
health professional must be documented in the child's record and signed by the mental health
professional who accepts full professional responsibility;
     (5) providing direction to a mental health behavioral aide. For entities that employ mental health
behavioral aides, the clinical supervisor must be employed by the provider entity or other certified
children's therapeutic supports and services provider entity to ensure necessary and appropriate
oversight for the client's treatment and continuity of care. The mental health professional or mental
health practitioner giving direction must begin with the goals on the individualized treatment
plan, and instruct the mental health behavioral aide on how to construct therapeutic activities and
interventions that will lead to goal attainment. The professional or practitioner giving direction
must also instruct the mental health behavioral aide about the client's diagnosis, functional status,
and other characteristics that are likely to affect service delivery. Direction must also include
determining that the mental health behavioral aide has the skills to interact with the client and
the client's family in ways that convey personal and cultural respect and that the aide actively
solicits information relevant to treatment from the family. The aide must be able to clearly explain
the activities the aide is doing with the client and the activities' relationship to treatment goals.
Direction is more didactic than is supervision and requires the professional or practitioner providing
it to continuously evaluate the mental health behavioral aide's ability to carry out the activities of
the individualized treatment plan and the individualized behavior plan. When providing direction,
the professional or practitioner must:
   (i) review progress notes prepared by the mental health behavioral aide for accuracy and
consistency with diagnostic assessment, treatment plan, and behavior goals and the professional or
practitioner must approve and sign the progress notes;
   (ii) identify changes in treatment strategies, revise the individual behavior plan, and

communicate treatment instructions and methodologies as appropriate to ensure that treatment is
implemented correctly;
    (iii) demonstrate family-friendly behaviors that support healthy collaboration among the child,
the child's family, and providers as treatment is planned and implemented;
    (iv) ensure that the mental health behavioral aide is able to effectively communicate with the
child, the child's family, and the provider; and
  (v) record the results of any evaluation and corrective actions taken to modify the work of the
mental health behavioral aide;
   (6) providing service delivery that implements the individual treatment plan and meets the
requirements under subdivision 9; and
    (7) individual treatment plan review. The review must determine the extent to which the services
have met the goals and objectives in the previous treatment plan. The review must assess the client's
progress and ensure that services and treatment goals continue to be necessary and appropriate to
the client and the client's family or foster family. Revision of the individual treatment plan does not
require a new diagnostic assessment unless the client's mental health status has changed markedly.
The updated treatment plan must be signed by the client, if appropriate, and by the client's parent or
other person authorized by statute to give consent to the mental health services for the child.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0943, subdivision 9, is amended to read:

and delivering services to meet the client's and client's family's needs, as specified in each client's
individual treatment plan;
    (2) site-based programs, including day treatment and preschool programs, provide staffing and

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2008, and applies to coverage offered,
sold, issued, and renewed on or after that date.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Base budget detail. The commissioner shall provide the commissioner of finance with
the information necessary to provide base budget detail to the legislature under section 16A.10,
subdivision 2a.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 151.37, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Prescribing and filing. (a) A licensed practitioner in the course of professional
practice only, may prescribe, administer, and dispense a legend drug, and may cause the same to be
administered by a nurse, a physician assistant, or medical student or resident under the practitioner's
direction and supervision, and may cause a person who is an appropriately certified, registered,
or licensed health care professional to prescribe, dispense, and administer the same within the
expressed legal scope of the person's practice as defined in Minnesota Statutes. A licensed
practitioner may prescribe a legend drug, without reference to a specific patient, by directing a
nurse, pursuant to section 148.235, subdivisions 8 and 9, physician assistant, or medical student
or resident to adhere to a particular practice guideline or protocol when treating patients whose
condition falls within such guideline or protocol, and when such guideline or protocol specifies the
circumstances under which the legend drug is to be prescribed and administered. An individual
who verbally, electronically, or otherwise transmits a written, oral, or electronic order, as an agent
of a prescriber, shall not be deemed to have prescribed the legend drug. This paragraph applies to a
physician assistant only if the physician assistant meets the requirements of section 147A.18.
    (b) A licensed practitioner that dispenses for profit a legend drug that is to be administered
orally, is ordinarily dispensed by a pharmacist, and is not a vaccine, must file with the practitioner's
licensing board a statement indicating that the practitioner dispenses legend drugs for profit, the
general circumstances under which the practitioner dispenses for profit, and the types of legend drugs
generally dispensed. It is unlawful to dispense legend drugs for profit after July 31, 1990, unless
the statement has been filed with the appropriate licensing board. For purposes of this paragraph,
"profit" means (1) any amount received by the practitioner in excess of the acquisition cost of a
legend drug for legend drugs that are purchased in prepackaged form, or (2) any amount received
by the practitioner in excess of the acquisition cost of a legend drug plus the cost of making the drug
available if the legend drug requires compounding, packaging, or other treatment. The statement
filed under this paragraph is public data under section 13.03. This paragraph does not apply to a
licensed doctor of veterinary medicine or a registered pharmacist. Any person other than a licensed
practitioner with the authority to prescribe, dispense, and administer a legend drug under paragraph
(a) shall not dispense for profit. To dispense for profit does not include dispensing by a community
health clinic when the profit from dispensing is used to meet operating expenses.
    (c) A prescription or drug order for a legend drug is not valid if it is based solely on an
online questionnaire, unless it can be established that the prescription or order was based on a
documented patient evaluation adequate to establish a diagnosis and identify underlying conditions
and contraindications to treatment.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 152.11, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 2d. Identification requirement for schedule II or III controlled substance. (a) No

person may dispense a controlled substance included in schedule II or III without requiring the
person purchasing the controlled substance, who need not be the person for whom the controlled
substance prescription is written, to present valid photographic identification, unless the person
purchasing the controlled substance, or if applicable the person for whom the controlled substance
prescription is written, is known to the dispenser.
    (b) This subdivision applies only to purchases of controlled substances that are not covered, in
whole or in part, by a health plan company or other third-party payor. The Board of Pharmacy shall
report to the legislature by July 1, 2009, on the effect of this subdivision. The board shall include
in the report the incidence of complaints, if any, generated by the requirements of this subdivision
and whether this subdivision is creating barriers to pharmaceutical access.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169A.70, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Assessor standards; rules; assessment time limits. A chemical use assessment
required by this section must be conducted by an assessor appointed by the court. The assessor
must meet the training and qualification requirements of rules adopted by the commissioner of
human services under section 254A.03, subdivision 3 (chemical dependency treatment rules).
Notwithstanding section 13.82 (law enforcement data), the assessor shall have access to any
police reports, laboratory test results, and other law enforcement data relating to the current
offense or previous offenses that are necessary to complete the evaluation. An assessor providing
an assessment under this section may not have any direct or shared financial interest or referral
relationship resulting in shared financial gain with a treatment provider, except as authorized under
section 254A.20, subdivision 3. If an independent assessor is not available, the court may use the
services of an assessor authorized to perform assessments for the county social services agency
under a variance granted under rules adopted by the commissioner of human services under section
254A.03, subdivision 3. An appointment for the defendant to undergo the assessment must be
made by the court, a court services probation officer, or the court administrator as soon as possible
but in no case more than one week after the defendant's court appearance. The assessment must be
completed no later than three weeks after the defendant's court appearance. If the assessment is not
performed within this time limit, the county where the defendant is to be sentenced shall perform
the assessment. The county of financial responsibility must be determined under chapter 256G.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 179A.03, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Essential employee. "Essential employee" means firefighters, peace officers subject
to licensure under sections 626.84 to 626.863, 911 system and police and fire department public
safety dispatchers, guards at correctional facilities, confidential employees, supervisory employees,
assistant county attorneys, assistant city attorneys, principals, and assistant principals. However, for
state employees, "essential employee" means all employees, except for nonprofessional employees
employed by the Department of Human Services in mental health facilities for the treatment of
psychopathic personalities, sexual predators, and the criminally insane, in law enforcement, public
safety radio communications operators, health care professionals, correctional guards, professional
engineering, and supervisory collective bargaining units, irrespective of severance, and no other
employees. For University of Minnesota employees, "essential employee" means all employees
in law enforcement, nursing professional and supervisory units, irrespective of severance, and
no other employees. "Firefighters" means salaried employees of a fire department whose duties

include, directly or indirectly, controlling, extinguishing, preventing, detecting, or investigating
fires. Employees for whom the state court administrator is the negotiating employer are not
essential employees. For Hennepin Healthcare System, Inc. employees, "essential employees"
means all employees.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 13. [254A.20] CHEMICAL USE ASSESSMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Persons arrested outside of home county. When a chemical use assessment is
required under Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to 9530.6655, for a person who is arrested and
taken into custody by a peace officer outside of the person's county of residence, the assessment must
be completed by the person's county of residence no later than three weeks after the assessment is
initially requested. If the assessment is not performed within this time limit, the county where the
person is to be sentenced shall perform the assessment. The county of financial responsibility is
determined under chapter 256G.
   Subd. 2. Probation officer as contact. When a chemical use assessment is required under
Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to 9530.6655, for a person who is on probation or under
other correctional supervision, the assessor, either orally or in writing, shall contact the person's
probation officer to verify or supplement the information provided by the person.
    Subd. 3. Financial conflicts of interest. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), an assessor
conducting a chemical use assessment under Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to 9530.6655, may
not have any direct or shared financial interest or referral relationship resulting in shared financial
gain with a treatment provider.
   (b) A county may contract with an assessor having a conflict described in paragraph (a) if the
county documents that:
    (1) the assessor is employed by a culturally specific service provider or a service provider with
a program designed to treat individuals of a specific age, sex, or sexual preference;
    (2) the county does not employ a sufficient number of qualified assessors and the only qualified
assessors available in the county have a direct or shared financial interest or a referral relationship
resulting in shared financial gain with a treatment provider; or
    (3) the county social service agency has an existing relationship with an assessor or service
provider and elects to enter into a contract with that assessor to provide both assessment and
treatment under circumstances specified in the county's contract, provided the county retains
responsibility for making placement decisions.
   An assessor under this paragraph may not place clients in treatment. The assessor shall gather
required information and provide it to the county along with any required documentation. The county
shall make all placement decisions for clients assessed by assessors under this paragraph.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, except for subdivision 3, which is
effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

subdivision 2a.
  Sec. 15. [256B.0636] PRESCRIBING OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES; ABUSE
PREVENTION.
   The commissioner shall develop and implement a plan to:
    (1) monitor the prescribing of controlled substances listed in section 152.02, subdivisions 3 and
4, and those substances defined by the Board of Pharmacy under section 152.02, subdivisions 8 and
12, by enrolled providers and providers under contract with participating managed care plans;
   (2) require enrolled providers and providers under contract with participating managed care
plans to report information related to potential patient abuse of the controlled substances to the
commissioner, and the Board of Pharmacy; and
   (3) provide education to Minnesota health care program enrollees on the proper use of controlled
substances.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 609.115, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Chemical use assessment required. (a) If a person is convicted of a felony, the
probation officer shall determine in the report prepared under subdivision 1 whether or not alcohol
or drug use was a contributing factor to the commission of the offense. If so, the report shall
contain the results of a chemical use assessment conducted in accordance with this subdivision.
The probation officer shall make an appointment for the defendant to undergo the chemical use
assessment if so indicated.
    (b) The chemical use assessment report must include a recommended level of care for the
defendant in accordance with the criteria contained in rules adopted by the commissioner of human
services under section 254A.03, subdivision 3. The assessment must be conducted by an assessor
qualified under rules adopted by the commissioner of human services under section 254A.03,
subdivision 3. An assessor providing a chemical use assessment may not have any direct or
shared financial interest or referral relationship resulting in shared financial gain with a treatment
provider, except as authorized under section 254A.20, subdivision 3. If an independent assessor
is not available, the probation officer may use the services of an assessor authorized to perform
assessments for the county social services agency under a variance granted under rules adopted by

revenue received by each training site as a percentage of all public program revenue received by all
training sites in the fund pool; and
    (2) a supplemental public program volume factor, which is determined by providing a
supplemental payment of 20 percent of each training site's grant to training sites whose public
program revenue accounted for at least 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received
by all eligible training sites. Grants to training sites whose public program revenue accounted for
less than 0.98 percent of the total public program revenue received by all eligible training sites
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total value of the supplemental payment.

as follows:
      (1) $1,475,000 to the University of Minnesota Medical Center-Fairview;
      (2) $2,075,000 to the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry; and
      (3) $1,800,000 to the Academic Health Center.
    (c) Funds distributed shall not be used to displace current funding appropriations from federal
or state sources.
    (d) Funds shall be distributed to the sponsoring institutions indicating the amount to be
distributed to each of the sponsor's clinical medical education programs based on the criteria in
this subdivision and in accordance with the commissioner's approval letter. Each clinical medical
education program must distribute funds allocated under paragraph (a) to the training sites as
specified in the commissioner's approval letter. Sponsoring institutions, which are accredited
through an organization recognized by the Department of Education or the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, may contract directly with training sites to provide clinical training. To
ensure the quality of clinical training, those accredited sponsoring institutions must:
   (1) develop contracts specifying the terms, expectations, and outcomes of the clinical training
conducted at sites; and
   (2) take necessary action if the contract requirements are not met. Action may include the
withholding of payments under this section or the removal of students from the site.
    (e) Any funds not distributed in accordance with the commissioner's approval letter must be
returned to the medical education and research fund within 30 days of receiving notice from the
commissioner. The commissioner shall distribute returned funds to the appropriate training sites in
accordance with the commissioner's approval letter.

each training site;

coverage, the health care provider must give the consumer, and at no cost to the consumer, a
good faith estimate of the average allowable reimbursement the provider accepts as payment from
private third-party payers for the services specified by the consumer and the estimated amount the
noncovered consumer will be required to pay. Payment information provided by a provider, or
by the provider's designee as agreed to by that designee, to a patient pursuant to this subdivision
does not constitute a legally binding estimate of the allowable charge for or cost to the consumer
of services.

of an enrollee or the enrollee's designee, provide that enrollee with a good faith estimate of the

     Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62L.12, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Exceptions. (a) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual conversion policies
to eligible employees otherwise eligible for conversion coverage under section 62D.104 as a result
of leaving a health maintenance organization's service area.
   (b) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual conversion policies to eligible employees
otherwise eligible for conversion coverage as a result of the expiration of any continuation of group
coverage required under sections 62A.146, 62A.17, 62A.21, 62C.142, 62D.101, and 62D.105.
  (c) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew conversion policies under section 62E.16 to eligible
employees.
  (d) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual continuation policies to eligible
employees as required.
    (e) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual health plans if the coverage is appropriate
due to an unexpired preexisting condition limitation or exclusion applicable to the person under the
employer's group health plan or due to the person's need for health care services not covered under
the employer's group health plan.

    (f) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew an individual health plan, if the individual has
elected to buy the individual health plan not as part of a general plan to substitute individual health
plans for a group health plan nor as a result of any violation of subdivision 3 or 4.
    (g) Nothing in this subdivision relieves a health carrier of any obligation to provide continuation
or conversion coverage otherwise required under federal or state law.
   (h) Nothing in this chapter restricts the offer, sale, issuance, or renewal of coverage issued as a
supplement to Medicare under sections 62A.3099 to 62A.44, or policies or contracts that supplement
Medicare issued by health maintenance organizations, or those contracts governed by sections 1833,
1851 to 1859, 1860D, or 1876 of the federal Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section
1395 et seq., as amended.
   (i) Nothing in this chapter restricts the offer, sale, issuance, or renewal of individual health plans
necessary to comply with a court order.
    (j) A health carrier may offer, issue, sell, or renew an individual health plan to persons eligible
for an employer group health plan, if the individual health plan is a high deductible health plan for
use in connection with an existing health savings account, in compliance with the Internal Revenue
Code, section 223. In that situation, the same or a different health carrier may offer, issue, sell, or
renew a group health plan to cover the other eligible employees in the group.
    (k) A health carrier may offer, sell, issue, or renew an individual health plan to one or more
employees of a small employer if the individual health plan is marketed ­          d­r

Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section 62A.67 or 62A.68 to all employees of the
small employer and the small employer does not contribute directly or indirectly to the premiums or
facilitate the administration of the individual health plan. The requirement to market an individual
health plan to all employees through the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section
62A.67 or 62A.68 does not require the health carrier to offer or issue an individual health plan to
any employee. For purposes of this paragraph, an employer is not contributing to the premiums
or facilitating the administration of the individual health plan if the employer does not contribute
to the premium and merely collects the premiums from an employee's wages or salary through
payroll deductions and submits payment for the premiums of one or more employees ­n            i­­

Insurance Exchange under section 62A.67 or 62A.68 shall jointly provide a cancellation notice
directly to the primary insured at least ten days prior to termination of coverage for nonpayment of

not provided coverage under section 62L.03 to the employees within the past 12 months.

      (4) reward the use of the most cost-effective settings, drugs, devices, providers, and treatments;
and
      (5) encourage consumers to maintain good health and use the health care system appropriately.
    In developing the plan, the commissioners shall analyze existing data to determine specific
services and health conditions for which changes in payment rates and methods would lead to
significant improvements in quality of care. The commissioners shall include a definition of the
term "quality" for uniform understanding of the plan's impact.
    Subd. 2. Report. The commissioners shall submit a report to the legislature by December
15, 2007, describing the payment reform plan. The report must include proposed legislation for

health plan company.
    Subd. 2 Proposal requirements. The planning grants shall be used by community partnerships
to develop a comprehensive proposal to provide affordable health care services to uninsured
and underinsured individuals with chronic health conditions through an integrated community
partnership system. A community partnership requesting a planning grant must submit to the
commissioner a planning proposal that includes:
   (1) methods for identifying potential uninsured or underinsured individuals and patients who
have or who are at risk of developing a chronic health condition;
   (2) methods to integrate and coordinate medical, mental health, and chemical health services
with services provided through county social services, corrections, public health, school districts,

    (2) summarizes the planned initiatives submitted to the commissioner based on the requirements
in this section.
      Sec. 24. CARE COORDINATION PILOT PROJECTS.
    Subdivision 1. Pilot projects. (a) The commissioner of human services shall develop and
administer up to four pilot projects for children and adults with complex health care needs
who are enrolled in fee-for-service medical assistance, to the extent permitted by federal
requirements. At least two of the grantees must focus on children with autism or children with
complex/multi-diagnoses physical conditions. The purpose of the projects is to pilot primary care
clinic models of care delivery focused on care coordination and family involvement in order to:

    (b) The pilot projects must involve the use of designated care professionals or clinics to serve
as a patient's medical home and be responsible for coordinating health care services across the
continuum of care.
    Subd. 2. Requirements. In order to be designated a pilot project, health care professionals or
clinics must demonstrate the ability to:
   (1) be the patient's first point of contact by telephone or other means, 24 hours per day, seven
days a week;
    (2) provide or arrange for patients' comprehensive health care needs, including the ability to
structure planned chronic disease visits and train and support the caregivers to effectively monitor
and manage the person's health condition;
   (3) coordinate patients' care when care must be provided outside the medical home;
   (4) provide longitudinal care, not just episodic care, including meeting long-term and unique
personal needs; and
   (5) systematically improve quality of care using, among other inputs, patient feedback.
    Subd. 3. Evaluation. Pilot projects must be evaluated based on patient satisfaction, provider
satisfaction, clinical process and outcome measures, program costs and savings, and economic
impact on health care providers. Pilot projects must be evaluated based on the extent to which the
medical home:
   (1) coordinated health care services across the continuum of care and thereby reduced
duplication of services and enhanced communication across providers;
    (2) provided safe and high-quality care by increasing utilization of effective treatments, reduced
use of ineffective treatments, reduced barriers to essential care and services, and eliminated barriers
to access;
   (3) reduced unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits and increased use of
cost-effective care and settings;
   (4) encouraged long-term patient and provider relationships by shifting from episodic care to
consistent, coordinated communication and care with a specified team of providers or individual
providers;
    (5) engaged and educated consumers by encouraging shared patient and provider responsibility
and accountability for disease prevention, health promotion, chronic disease management, acute
care, and overall well-being, encouraging informed medical decision-making, ensuring the
availability of accurate medical information, and facilitated the transfer of accurate medical
information;
   (6) fostered the expansion of a technology infrastructure that supports collaboration; and
    (7) reduced overall health care costs as compared to conventional payment methods for similar
patient populations.
   Subd. 4. Rulemaking. The commissioner is exempt from administrative rulemaking under

real property, the seller must disclose in writing to the buyer information about the status and location
of all known wells on the property, by delivering to the buyer either a statement by the seller that
the seller does not know of any wells on the property, or a disclosure statement indicating the legal
description and county, and a map drawn from available information showing the location of each
well to the extent practicable. In the disclosure statement, the seller must indicate, for each well,
whether the well is in use, not in use, or sealed.
   (b) At the time of closing of the sale, the disclosure statement information, name and mailing

address of the buyer, and the quartile, section, township, and range in which each well is located
must be provided on a well disclosure certificate signed by the seller or a person authorized to act
on behalf of the seller.
    (c) A well disclosure certificate need not be provided if the seller does not know of any wells
on the property and the deed or other instrument of conveyance contains the statement: "The Seller
certifies that the Seller does not know of any wells on the described real property."
    (d) If a deed is given pursuant to a contract for deed, the well disclosure certificate required by
this subdivision shall be signed by the buyer or a person authorized to act on behalf of the buyer.
If the buyer knows of no wells on the property, a well disclosure certificate is not required if the
following statement appears on the deed followed by the signature of the grantee or, if there is
more than one grantee, the signature of at least one of the grantees: "The Grantee certifies that the
Grantee does not know of any wells on the described real property." The statement and signature of
the grantee may be on the front or back of the deed or on an attached sheet and an acknowledgment
of the statement by the grantee is not required for the deed to be recordable.
   (e) This subdivision does not apply to the sale, exchange, or transfer of real property:
   (1) that consists solely of a sale or transfer of severed mineral interests; or
   (2) that consists of an individual condominium unit as described in chapters 515 and 515B.
   (f) For an area owned in common under chapter 515 or 515B the association or other responsible
person must report to the commissioner by July 1, 1992, the location and status of all wells in the
common area. The association or other responsible person must notify the commissioner within 30
days of any change in the reported status of wells.
    (g) For real property sold by the state under section 92.67, the lessee at the time of the sale is
responsible for compliance with this subdivision.
    (h) If the seller fails to provide a required well disclosure certificate, the buyer, or a person
authorized to act on behalf of the buyer, may sign a well disclosure certificate based on the
information provided on the disclosure statement required by this section or based on other
available information.
     (i) A county recorder or registrar of titles may not record a deed or other instrument of
conveyance dated after October 31, 1990, for which a certificate of value is required under
section 272.115, or any deed or other instrument of conveyance dated after October 31, 1990,
from a governmental body exempt from the payment of state deed tax, unless the deed or other
instrument of conveyance contains the statement made in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d)
or is accompanied by the well disclosure certificate containing all the information required by
paragraph (b) or (d). The county recorder or registrar of titles must not accept a certificate unless it
contains all the required information. The county recorder or registrar of titles shall note on each
deed or other instrument of conveyance accompanied by a well disclosure certificate that the well
disclosure certificate was received. The notation must include the statement "No wells on property"
if the disclosure certificate states there are no wells on the property. The well disclosure certificate
shall not be filed or recorded in the records maintained by the county recorder or registrar of titles.
After noting "No wells on property" on the deed or other instrument of conveyance, the county
recorder or registrar of titles shall destroy or return to the buyer the well disclosure certificate. The

                                                     40­ $45 for receipt of a completed well disclosure
certificate. By the tenth day of each month, the county recorder or registrar of titles shall transmit
the well disclosure certificates to the commissioner of health. By the tenth day after the end of each
calendar quarter, the county recorder or registrar of titles shall transmit to the commissioner of
health ­$3
         ­2­­5­ $37.50 of the fee for each well disclosure certificate received during the quarter. The
            .­0
commissioner shall maintain the well disclosure certificate for at least six years. The commissioner
may store the certificate as an electronic image. A copy of that image shall be as valid as the
original.
    (j) No new well disclosure certificate is required under this subdivision if the buyer or seller, or
a person authorized to act on behalf of the buyer or seller, certifies on the deed or other instrument
of conveyance that the status and number of wells on the property have not changed since the last
previously filed well disclosure certificate. The following statement, if followed by the signature of
the person making the statement, is sufficient to comply with the certification requirement of this
paragraph: "I am familiar with the property described in this instrument and I certify that the status
and number of wells on the described real property have not changed since the last previously filed
well disclosure certificate." The certification and signature may be on the front or back of the deed
or on an attached sheet and an acknowledgment of the statement is not required for the deed or other
instrument of conveyance to be recordable.
    (k) The commissioner in consultation with county recorders shall prescribe the form for a well
disclosure certificate and provide well disclosure certificate forms to county recorders and registrars
of titles and other interested persons.
    (l) Failure to comply with a requirement of this subdivision does not impair:
    (1) the validity of a deed or other instrument of conveyance as between the parties to the deed or
instrument or as to any other person who otherwise would be bound by the deed or instrument; or
   (2) the record, as notice, of any deed or other instrument of conveyance accepted for filing or
recording contrary to the provisions of this subdivision.

detect the heritable or congenital disorder, the ability to treat or prevent medical conditions caused
by the heritable or congenital disorder, and the severity of the medical conditions caused by the
heritable or congenital disorder. The list of tests to be performed may be revised if the changes
are recommended by the advisory committee established under section 144.1255, approved by the
commissioner, and published in the State Register. The revision is exempt from the rulemaking
requirements in chapter 14, and sections 14.385 and 14.386 do not apply.
    Subd. 3. Objection of parents to test. Persons with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1
shall advise parents of infants (1) that the blood or tissue samples used to perform testing thereunder
as well as the results of such testing may be retained by the Department of Health, (2) the benefit of
retaining the blood or tissue sample, and (3) that the following options are available to them with
respect to the testing: (i) to decline to have the tests, or (ii) to elect to have the tests but to require
that all blood samples and records of test results be destroyed within 24 months of the testing. If
the parents of an infant object in writing to testing for heritable and congenital disorders or elect to
require that blood samples and test results be destroyed, the objection or election shall be recorded
on a form that is signed by a parent or legal guardian and made part of the infant's medical record.

  198.075 MINNESOTA VETERANS HOME EMPLOYEES; EXCLUDED FROM
COMMISSARY PRIVILEGES.
63RD DAY]                             MONDAY, MAY 7, 2007                                         3645

    Except as provided in this section, no commissary privileges including food, laundry service,
janitorial service, and household supplies shall be furnished to any employee of the Minnesota

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0625, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 49. Lead risk assessments. (a) Effective October 1, 2007, or six months after federal
approval, whichever is later, medical assistance covers lead risk assessments provided by a lead
risk assessor who is licensed by the commissioner of health under section 144.9505 and employed
by an assessing agency as defined in section 144.9501. Medical assistance covers a onetime on-site
investigation of a recipient's home or primary residence to determine the existence of lead so long as
the recipient is under the age of 21 and has a venous blood lead level specified in section 144.9504,
subdivision 2, paragraph (a).
    (b) Medical assistance reimbursement covers the lead risk assessor's time to complete the
following activities:
   (1) gathering samples;
   (2) interviewing family members;
   (3) gathering data, including meter readings; and
   (4) providing a report with the results of the investigation and options for reducing lead-based
paint hazards.
    Medical assistance coverage of lead risk assessment does not include testing of environmental
substances such as water, paint, or soil or any other laboratory services. Medical assistance coverage
of lead risk assessments is not included in the capitated services for children enrolled in health plans
through the prepaid medical assistance program and the MinnesotaCare program.
    (c) Payment for lead risk assessment must be cost-based and must meet the criteria for
federal financial participation under the Medicaid program. The rate must be based on allowable
expenditures from cost information gathered. Under section 144.9507, subdivision 5, federal
medical assistance funds may not replace existing funding for lead-related activities. The nonfederal
share of costs for services provided under this subdivision must be from state or local funds
and is the responsibility of the agency providing the risk assessment. When the risk assessment
is conducted by the commissioner of health, the state share must be from appropriations to the
commissioner of health for this purpose. Eligible expenditures for the nonfederal share of costs
may not be made from federal funds or funds used to match other federal funds. Any federal
disallowances are the responsibility of the agency providing risk assessment services.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.59, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Agreement. Two or more governmental units, by agreement entered into
through action of their governing bodies, may jointly or cooperatively exercise any power common
to the contracting parties or any similar powers, including those which are the same except for the
territorial limits within which they may be exercised. The agreement may provide for the exercise
3646                                                                     JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                     [63RD DAY

of such powers by one or more of the participating governmental units on behalf of the other
participating units. The term "governmental unit" as used in this section includes every city, county,
town, school district, other political subdivision of this or another state, another state, the University
of Minnesota, nonprofit hospitals licensed under sections 144.50 to 144.56, rehabilitation facilities
and extended employment providers that are certified by the commissioner of employment and
economic development, day training and habilitation services licensed under sections 245B.01
to 245B.08, nonprofit community health clinics providing family planning services as defined in
section 145.925, and any agency of the state of Minnesota or the United States, and includes any
instrumentality of a governmental unit. For the purpose of this section, an instrumentality of a
governmental unit means an instrumentality having independent policy making and appropriating
authority.
   Sec. 18. Laws 2005, First Special Session chapter 4, article 9, section 3, subdivision 2, is
