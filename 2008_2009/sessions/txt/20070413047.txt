inspector. The certified amusement ride inspector must be either:
   (1) an employee of the insurance company that insures the amusement ride; or
    (2) an independent inspection service provider that the insurance company or owner, or the State
Agricultural Society, has contracted with, or an employee of the independent inspection service
provider. If the certified amusement ride inspector is not an employee or agent of the insurance
company that insures the amusement ride, then the independent inspection service provider must,
before performing the inspection, provide proof of liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000
to the insurance company or owner, or the State Agricultural Society, with whom the independent
service provider has contracted.
     (b) Amusement rides that are not operated in Minnesota on a continual year-round basis must be
inspected in the same calendar year and prior to July 1, or the first operation in Minnesota, whichever
is later. Amusement rides that did not pass an inspection required by this section in the previous year
must be inspected before being operated in Minnesota.
    (c) If an inspection reveals that an amusement ride does not meet the current American Society
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards on Amusement Rides and Devices, F 846-92 and F
893-04, the insurer or independent inspection service provider must notify the owner of all defects.
    (d) No person shall operate an amusement ride unless: (1) the amusement ride passed the most
recent annual inspection required by this section; or (2) all defects identified during the most recent
annual inspection have been corrected and the amusement ride passed a reinspection.
    (e) All inspections and reinspections required by this section must include evaluation consistent
with the current ASTM Standards on Amusement Rides and Devices, F 846-92 and F 893-04.
All owners and operators must permit reasonable inspection of an amusement ride by the certified
amusement ride inspector selected by the insurer or independent inspection service provider.
   (f) The inspections required by this section are in addition to any other inspections required or
permitted by law.
    (g) Before the amusement ride is operated, an owner of an amusement ride must file with
each sponsor, lessor, landowner, or other person who has contracted for the amusement ride to
be offered to any riders an inspection affidavit attesting that the amusement ride passed the most
recent inspection or reinspection required by this section. The inspection affidavit shall identify
the amusement ride by name, manufacturer, and serial number, the date inspection was performed,
and the inspector's name and certification number.
     (h) An owner of an amusement ride, or the State Agricultural Society on its behalf, must also
file the affidavit of inspection with the commissioner not later than ten days after the completion of
each inspection, required by this section, that the amusement ride passes.
    Subd. 2. Daily inspections. No person shall operate an amusement ride unless a daily inspection
has been performed according to this section on the day of operation. An owner or operator of the
amusement ride or certified amusement ride inspector shall perform the daily inspection before
the ride is put into operation that day. The daily inspection shall be consistent with the current
ASTM Standards on Amusement Rides and Devices, F 770-93. Each daily inspection shall be
recorded in a daily logbook kept for each amusement ride. An owner of the amusement ride, or
the State Agricultural Society on its behalf, shall maintain the record of daily inspections for a

period of not less than three years, and shall make the record of daily inspections available to the
commissioner upon request. An owner or operator shall not knowingly operate, or permit to be
operated, an amusement ride that has not passed the most recent daily inspection.
    Subd. 3. Inspection after alteration or modification. An amusement ride that has been
modified or altered in a manner that changes its dynamics or control system from the original
manufacturer's design or specification since its last annual inspection must be inspected by a
certified amusement ride inspector before it may be operated.
    Subd. 4. Inspection after serious injury or illness. An amusement ride must be inspected by
a certified amusement ride inspector and approved by the commissioner before it may be operated
following a serious injury or illness involving the ride. A "serious injury or illness" has the meaning
given it in section 184B.045.
   Subd. 5. Availability for inspection. The owner of an amusement ride must make the ride
available for inspections at all reasonable times and places requested by the commissioner or a
law enforcement agency.
   Sec. 8. [184B.045] RECORDING AND REPORTING.
   (a) An owner, or the State Agricultural Society on its behalf, shall maintain a first-aid incident
report log for all rider injuries or illnesses resulting from the operation of an amusement ride, other
than minor injuries or illnesses. The recorded information shall include the following:
   (1) date the injury or illness occurred;
    (2) name, address, and telephone number of the rider receiving emergency health care service
or treatment;
   (3) age of the rider;
    (4) manufacturer's name and serial number of the amusement ride involved in the incident or
illness;
   (5) description of the injury or illness;
   (6) description of the first-aid service or treatment administered; and
   (7) any other pertinent information.
    (b) An owner, or the State Agricultural Society on its behalf, shall maintain the first-aid
incident report log for a period of not less than three years, and shall make the first-aid incident
report log available to the commissioner upon request. An owner of an amusement ride, or the
State Agricultural Society on its behalf, shall provide a report to the commissioner and a local law
enforcement agency of any accident or incident arising from the use or operation of an amusement
ride resulting in serious rider injury or illness. The accident involving the serious injury or illness
must be investigated by the local law enforcement agency or the commissioner. A serious injury
or illness is an injury or illness that results in death, dismemberment, disfigurement, compound
fracture, or permanent loss of the use of a body organ, member, function, or system, or that requires
hospital admission within 24 hours of the accident or incident.

   Delete everything after the resolving clause and insert:
    "WHEREAS, the Conservation Reserve Program is a voluntary federal program that protects
millions of acres of American topsoil from erosion, thereby safeguarding our nation's soil and water
resources while at the same time benefiting our nation's farmers and farming communities; and
   WHEREAS, some 33,000 Minnesota farms participate in the Conservation Reserve Program,
committing to take 1,800,000 of our state's most environmentally sensitive acres out of agricultural
production for a period of ten to 15 years; and
    WHEREAS, Minnesota farmers have instituted conservation and erosion control measures on
these acres, including planting trees and native grasses, installing filter strips and riparian buffers,
and restoring wetlands important to wildlife including native and migrating waterfowl; and
   WHEREAS, through the Conservation Reserve Program, Minnesota farmers remove
environmentally sensitive acres from agricultural production and plant them with cover crops; and
   WHEREAS, the Wetlands Reserve Program is a voluntary federal program in which Minnesota
landowners protect, restore, and enhance wetlands on their property, thereby improving wetland
values and functions and providing valuable wildlife habitat; and
    WHEREAS, the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program have the
ability to sequester carbon in addition to providing erosion control, water quality protection, and
wildlife habitat; and
   WHEREAS, in 2006 there were 14,500 acres enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program in
Minnesota, representing nearly ten percent of program acreage nationwide and trailing only
Arkansas and Nebraska in the number of acres enrolled; and
   WHEREAS, recent United States Department of Agriculture decisions regarding rental rates,
appraisals, eligibility, and maintenance have limited enrollment in the Conservation Reserve
Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program well below the amount of acres authorized in the
2002 Farm Bill; and
   WHEREAS, as successful and equitable conservation programs, the Conservation Reserve
Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program enjoy broad support in Minnesota from farming,
hunting, wildlife, and environmental communities; NOW, THEREFORE,
   BE IT RESOLVED by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota that it urges the United States
Department of Agriculture to utilize its authority to offer general sign-up enrollments during
2007 with competitive market rental rates to achieve the enrollment of acres authorized for the
Conservation Reserve Program in the 2002 Farm Bill.
   BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota that it urges the
