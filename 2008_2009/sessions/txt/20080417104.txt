   S.F. No. 3683, which the committee recommends to pass with the following amendments offered
by Senators Rest, Dille, Skoe and Kubly:
   Senator Rest moved to amend S.F. No. 3683 as follows:
   Page 30, after line 8, insert:
   "Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 240.06, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5a. Additional license; metropolitan area. (a) Notwithstanding subdivision 5, the
commission may issue one additional class A license within the seven-county metropolitan area,
provided that the additional license may only be issued for a facility:
   (1) located more than 20 miles from any other racetrack in existence on January 1, 1987;

   (4) not owned or operated by a governmental entity or a nonprofit organization; and
    (5) that has a current road or highway system adequate to facilitate present and future vehicular
traffic expeditiously to and from the facility.
   The consideration of clause (5) shall prevail when two competing licensees are relatively equal
regarding other considerations mandated by law or rule.
   (b) An application for an additional class A license within the seven-county metropolitan area
may not delay or adversely affect an application for a class A license for a facility to be located
outside the seven-county metropolitan area.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 240.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
104TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 2008                                         8711

    Subd. 5b. Sharing of purse set-aside and breeders fund revenue. Notwithstanding subdivision
5, a class A licensed racetrack operating within the seven-county metropolitan area may:
    (1) enter into an agreement with a horsepersons' organization that represents a breed other than
the breed racing at the licensee's racetrack under which the licensee agrees to pay a percentage
of simulcasting or card club revenues to the purse set-aside account of another class A licensed
racetrack operating within the seven-county metropolitan area. The licensee may only enter into
such an agreement with a horsepersons' organization that represents a breed other than the breed
racing at the licensee's racetrack. All amounts contributed to a class A racetrack under such an
agreement must go to purses for races run at that racetrack; and
   (2) conduct simulcasting on all breeds of horses if it:
    (i) enters into an agreement with another class A licensed racetrack within the seven-county
metropolitan area regarding simulcasting of any breed of horses raced at such other class A licensed
racetrack that the class A racetrack elects to simulcast; and
    (ii) contributes to the purse set-aside account of another class A licensed racetrack operating
within the seven-county metropolitan area, and to the breeders fund, an amount equal to the amount
that would have been contributed to the set-aside account and the breeders fund, as required by
statute, if the simulcast had been conducted at such other class A licensed racetrack. The percentages
used to determine the amount of the simulcast contribution to the purse set-aside account and the
breeders fund will be the percentage required under law. Contributions to the purse set-aside account
shall be used by such other class A licensed racetrack for purses for races conducted by that racetrack
in the same manner as if the simulcast had occurred at that racetrack.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 240.13, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Simulcasting. (a) The commission may permit an authorized licensee to conduct
simulcasting at the licensee's facility on any day authorized by the commission. All simulcasts
must comply with the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978, United States Code, title 15, sections
3001 to 3007.
    (b) The commission may not authorize any day for simulcasting at a class A facility during
the racing season, and a licensee may not be allowed to transmit out-of-state telecasts of races the
licensee conducts, unless the licensee has obtained the approval of the horsepersons' organization
representing the majority of the horsepersons racing the breed involved at the licensed racetrack
during the preceding 12 months. In the case of a class A facility licensed under section 240.06,
subdivision 5a, the approval applicable to the first year of the racetrack's operation may be obtained
from the horsepersons' organization that represents the majority of horsepersons who will race the
breed involved at the licensed racetrack during the first year of the racetrack's operation.
    (c) The licensee may pay fees and costs to an entity transmitting a telecast of a race to the licensee
for purposes of conducting pari-mutuel wagering on the race. The licensee may deduct fees and
costs related to the receipt of televised transmissions from a pari-mutuel pool on the televised race,
provided that one-half of any amount recouped in this manner must be added to the amounts required
to be set aside for purses.
    (d) With the approval of the commission and subject to the provisions of this subdivision, a
licensee may transmit telecasts of races it conducts, for wagering purposes, to locations outside the
8712                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [104TH DAY

state, and the commission may allow this to be done on a commingled pool basis.
    (e) Except as otherwise provided in this section, simulcasting may be conducted on a separate
pool basis or, with the approval of the commission, on a commingled pool basis. All provisions
of law governing pari-mutuel betting apply to simulcasting except as otherwise provided in this
subdivision or in the commission's rules. If pools are commingled, wagering at the licensed facility
must be on equipment electronically linked with the equipment at the licensee's class A facility
or with the sending racetrack via the totalizator computer at the licensee's class A facility. Subject
to the approval of the commission, the types of betting, takeout, and distribution of winnings on
commingled pari-mutuel pools are those in effect at the sending racetrack. Breakage for pari-mutuel
pools on a televised race must be calculated in accordance with the law or rules governing the
sending racetrack for these pools, and must be distributed in a manner agreed to between the licensee
and the sending racetrack. Notwithstanding subdivision 7 and section 240.15, subdivision 5, the
commission may approve procedures governing the definition and disposition of unclaimed tickets
that are consistent with the law and rules governing unclaimed tickets at the sending racetrack. For
the purposes of this section, "sending racetrack" is either the racetrack outside of this state where
the horse race is conducted or, with the consent of the racetrack, an alternative facility that serves
as the racetrack for the purpose of commingling pools.
   (f) Except as otherwise provided in section 240.06, subdivision 5b, paragraph (2), if there is more
than one class B licensee conducting racing within the seven-county metropolitan area, simulcasting
may be conducted only on races run by a breed that ran at the licensee's class A facility within the
12 months preceding the event."
