the new beds are transferred from a 182-bed facility in Albert Lea under common ownership; (ii) the
commissioner of human services is authorized by the 2004 legislature to negotiate budget-neutral
planned nursing facility closures; and (iii) money is available from planned closures of facilities
under common ownership to make implementation of this clause budget-neutral to the state. The
bed capacity of the Albert Lea facility shall be reduced to 167 beds following the transfer. Of the 60

    (i) compute the estimated decrease in medical assistance residents served by the nursing facility
by multiplying the decrease in licensed beds by the historical percentage of medical assistance
resident days;

beds by multiplying the anticipated decrease in medical assistance residents, determined in item (i),
by the existing facility's weighted average payment rate multiplied by 365;
     (iii) compute the anticipated annual costs for community-based services by multiplying the
anticipated decrease in medical assistance residents served by the nursing facility, determined in item
(i), by the average monthly elderly waiver service costs for individuals in Steele County multiplied
by 12;
   (iv) subtract the amount in item (iii) from the amount in item (ii); and
   (v) divide the amount in item (iv) by an amount equal to the relocated nursing facility's
occupancy factor under section 256B.431, subdivision 3f, paragraph (c), multiplied by the historical
percentage of medical assistance resident days.
   For subsequent years, the adjusted property payment rate shall be adjusted for inflation as

unexpired term, a special election must be held under subdivision 1. If less than one year remains in
the unexpired term, the county board may appoint a person to fill the vacancy for the remainder of
the unexpired term, unless the vacancy occurs within 90 days of the next county general election, in
which case an appointment shall not be made and the vacancy must be filled at the general election.
The person elected to fill a vacancy at the general election takes office immediately in the same
manner as for a special election under subdivision 1, and serves the remainder of the unexpired
term and the new term for which the election was otherwise held.
       Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 375.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. County boards. Before making an appointment to fill a vacancy under subdivision 4,
the county board must hold a public hearing not more than 30 days after the vacancy occurs with
public notice given in the same manner as for a special meeting of the county board. At the public
hearing the board must invite public testimony from persons residing in the district in which the
vacancy occurs relating to the qualifications of prospective appointees to fill the vacancy. Before
making an appointment, the board also must notify public officials in the affected district on the
appointment, including town board and city council members, and must enter into the record at
the board meeting in which the appointment is made the names and addresses of the public officials
notified. If after the public hearing, the board is unable or decides not to make an appointment under
subdivision 4, it must hold a special election under subdivision 1, but the time period in which the
election must be held begins to run from the date of the public hearing."
       Delete the title and insert:
    "A bill for an act relating to local government; providing for a public hearing and public
testimony before making an appointment to fill a vacancy on a county board; changing the time
period in which an appointment may be made; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 375.101,
by adding a subdivision; Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 375.101, subdivision 4."
