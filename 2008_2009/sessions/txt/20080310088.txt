88TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                          7069

nonrefundable fee has been paid. The temporary registration remains valid only until the meeting

for registration.
   Subd. 4. Registration expiration. Registrations issued under this chapter expire annually.

described in section 147E.25; and
    (4) submit any additional information requested by the board to clarify information presented in

or the renewal request is nullified.
    Subd. 6. Change of address. A registrant who changes addresses must inform the board within
30 days, in writing, of the change of address. All notices or other correspondence mailed to or served
on a registrant by the board are considered as having been received by the registrant.
    Subd. 7. Registration renewal notice. At least 45 days before the registration renewal date,
the board shall send out a renewal notice to the last known address of the registrant on file. The
notice must include a renewal application and a notice of fees required for renewal or instructions
for online renewal. It must also inform the registrant that registration will expire without further
action by the board if an application for registration renewal is not received before the deadline for
renewal. The registrant's failure to receive this notice does not relieve the registrant of the obligation
to meet the deadline and other requirements for registration renewal. Failure to receive this notice
is not grounds for challenging expiration of registration status.
     Subd. 8. Renewal deadline. The renewal application and fee must be postmarked on or before
December 31 of the year of renewal. If the postmark is illegible, the application is considered timely
if received by the third working day after the deadline.

status upon application to the board by the registrant and upon payment of an inactive status fee.

a period of no less than eight weeks of advisory council-approved supervision by another registered
naturopathic doctor.
    Subd. 10. Registration following lapse of registration status for two years or less. For any
individual whose registration status has lapsed for two years or less, to regain registration status, the
individual must:
7070                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [88TH DAY

   (1) apply for registration renewal according to subdivision 5;

    (3) submit the fees required under section 147E.40 for the period not registered, including the
fee for late renewal.
    Subd. 11. Cancellation due to nonrenewal. The board shall not renew, reissue, reinstate, or
restore a registration that has lapsed and has not been renewed within two annual registration renewal
cycles starting January 2007. A registrant whose registration is canceled for nonrenewal must obtain
a new registration by applying for registration and fulfilling all requirements then in existence for
initial registration as a registered naturopathic doctor.
    Subd. 12. Cancellation of registration in good standing. (a) A registrant holding an active
registration as a registered naturopathic doctor in the state may, upon approval of the board, be
granted registration cancellation if the board is not investigating the person as a result of a complaint
or information received or if the board has not begun disciplinary proceedings against the registrant.
Such action by the board must be reported as a cancellation of registration in good standing.
    (b) A registrant who receives board approval for registration cancellation is not entitled to a
refund of any registration fees paid for the registration year in which cancellation of the registration
occurred.
    (c) To obtain registration after cancellation, a registrant must obtain a new registration by
applying for registration and fulfilling the requirements then in existence for obtaining initial
registration as a registered naturopathic doctor.
    Subd. 13. Emeritus status of registration. A registrant may change the status of the registration
to "emeritus" by filing the appropriate forms and paying the onetime fee of $50 to the board. This
status allows the registrant to retain the title of registered naturopathic doctor but restricts the
registrant from actively seeing patients.
   Sec. 6. [147E.20] BOARD ACTION ON APPLICATIONS FOR REGISTRATION.
   (a) The board shall act on each application for registration according to paragraphs (b) to (d).
    (b) The board shall determine if the applicant meets the requirements for registration under
section 147E.15. The board or advisory council may investigate information provided by an
applicant to determine whether the information is accurate and complete.
     (c) The board shall notify each applicant in writing of action taken on the application, the grounds
for denying registration if registration is denied, and the applicant's right to review under paragraph
(d).
    (d) Applicants denied registration may make a written request to the board, within 30 days of
the board's notice, to appear before the advisory council or the board and for the advisory council
to review the board's decision to deny the applicant's registration. After reviewing the denial, the
advisory council shall make a recommendation to the board as to whether the denial shall be
affirmed. Each applicant is allowed only one request for review each yearly registration period.

a random sample of registrants and require those registrants to supply the board with evidence

    Sec. 12. [347.541] DISPOSITION OF SEIZED ANIMALS.
    Subdivision 1. Hearing. The owner of any dog declared dangerous has the right to a hearing by
an impartial hearing officer.
    Subd. 2. Security. A person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of
the dog by posting security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog's actual cost of care and
keeping. The security must be posted within 14 days of the seizure inclusive of the date of the
seizure.
    Subd. 3. Notice. The authority declaring the dog dangerous shall give notice of this section by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at the place where the
dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on the property, and telephoning, if possible. The
notice must include:
    (1) a description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose of the dangerous dog declaration
and seizure; the time, place, and circumstances under which the dog was declared dangerous; and
the telephone number and contact person where the dog is kept;
    (2) a statement that the owner of the dog may request a hearing concerning the dangerous dog
declaration and, if applicable, prior potentially dangerous dog declarations for the dog, and that
failure to do so within 14 days of the date of the notice will terminate the owner's right to a hearing
under this section;
   (3) a statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of the notice, the owner must
immediately comply with the requirements of section 347.52, paragraphs (a) and (c), and until such
time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;
   (4) a statement that if the hearing officer affirms the dangerous dog declaration, the owner will
have 14 days from receipt of that decision to comply with all other requirements of sections 347.51,
347.515, and 347.52;
   (5) a form that can be used by the owner of the dog that was seized for requesting a hearing
under this subdivision; and
    (6) a statement that all actual costs of the care, keeping, and disposition of the dog are the
responsibility of the person claiming an interest in the dog, except to the extent that a court or
hearing officer finds that the seizure or impoundment was not substantially justified by law.
    Subd. 4. Right to hearing. Any hearing must be held within 30 days of the request to determine
the validity of the dangerous dog declaration. The hearing officer must be an impartial employee of
the local government or an impartial person retained by the local government to conduct the hearing.
In the event that the dangerous dog declaration is upheld by the hearing officer, actual expenses of
the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000 will be the responsibility of the dog's owner. The hearing
officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the hearing. The decision must be
delivered to the dog's owner by hand delivery or registered mail as soon as practical and a copy
must be provided to the animal control authority.
    Sec. 13. [347.542] RESTRICTIONS.

  Subdivision 1. Dog ownership prohibited. Except as provided in subdivision 3, no person may
own a dog if the person has:
    (1) been convicted of a third or subsequent violation of section 347.51, 347.515, or 347.52;
    (2) been convicted of a violation under section 609.205, clause (4);
    (3) been convicted of a gross misdemeanor under section 609.226, subdivision 1;
    (4) been convicted of a violation under section 609.226, subdivision 2; or
    (5) had a dog ordered destroyed under section 347.56 and been convicted of one or more
violations of section 347.51, 346.515, 347.52, or 609.226, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 2. Household members. No member of a household may own a dog where a person
resides who is prohibited from dog ownership under subdivision 1.
    Subd. 3. Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a conviction under
subdivision 1 prohibits a person from owning a dog, and annually thereafter, the person may request
that the animal control authority review the prohibition. The animal control authority may consider
such facts as the seriousness of the violation or violations that led to the prohibition, any criminal
convictions, or other facts that the animal control authority deems appropriate. The animal control
authority may rescind the prohibition entirely or rescind it with limitations. The animal control
authority also may establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition is rescinded,
including, but not limited to, successfully completing dog training or dog handling courses. If the
animal control authority rescinds a person's prohibition and the person subsequently fails to comply
with any limitations imposed by the animal control authority or the person is convicted of any animal
violation involving unprovoked bites or dog attacks, the animal control authority may permanently
prohibit the person from owning a dog in this state.

any nonforwardable mailing from an election official is returned as undeliverable but with no
forwarding address, the county auditor shall change the registrant's status to "challenged" in
the statewide registration system. An individual challenged in accordance with this subdivision
shall comply with the provisions of section 204C.12, before being allowed to vote. If a notice
mailed at least 60 days after the return of the first nonforwardable mailing is also returned by the
postal service, the county auditor shall change the registrant's status to "inactive" in the statewide
registration system.

   (1) "conviction" has the meaning given in section 609.02, subdivision 5;
    (2) "nonconviction criminal record" means a record of an arrest, citation, complaint, prosecution,
or other record relating to a criminal proceeding that is not pending and did not result in a conviction;
and
    (3) "private employer" means a person hiring or employing individuals in this state, but does not
include the state or a political subdivision of the state governed by sections 364.01 to 364.10.
   Subd. 2. Use of nonconviction records for private employment. Unless a criminal background
investigation is specifically required or permitted by law, a private employer must not:
   (1) request information regarding a nonconviction criminal record from an employee or
prospective employee or obtain access to a nonconviction criminal record from another source; or
    (2) take adverse action against an employee or prospective employee based on a nonconviction
criminal record.
    Subd. 3. Immunity from civil liability. (a) A private employer is immune from civil liability for
the negligent hiring of an individual with a criminal record of a conviction to the extent the criminal
record as of the date the individual was hired is the basis for the liability, if the employer followed
the provisions applicable to public employers in section 364.03 and reasonably determined that:
   (1) the conviction did not directly relate to the position of employment being sought; or
    (2) the individual showed evidence of sufficient rehabilitation and present fitness to perform the
duties of the employment being sought.
    (b) This subdivision does not create any duty on the part of an employer to follow the provisions
of paragraph (a).
     Subd. 4. Remedy. A private employer who violates subdivision 2 is liable to the individual who
is the subject of the criminal record for $1,000 or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever
is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees."

time a school hiring authority conducts the criminal history background check required under
subdivision 1 on an individual offered employment as a teacher, the school hiring authority
must contact the Board of Teaching to determine whether the board has taken disciplinary action
against the teacher based on a board determination that inappropriate sexual conduct or attempted
inappropriate sexual conduct occurred between the teacher and a student. If disciplinary action
has been taken based on this type of conduct, the school hiring authority must obtain access to
data that are public under sections 13.41, subdivision 5, and 13.43, subdivision 2, that relate to
the substance of the disciplinary action. In addition, the school hiring authority must require the
individual to provide information in the employment application regarding all current and previous
disciplinary actions in Minnesota and other states taken against the individual's teaching license as
a result of inappropriate sexual conduct or attempted inappropriate sexual conduct with a student
and indicate to the applicant that intentionally submitting false or incomplete information is a

    Subd. 2. Notice; service. (a) A secured party may commence repossession of a manufactured
home by personally serving upon the occupant of the mobile home a notice and, if the occupant
is not the debtor, by sending a registered or certified letter to the last known address of the debtor
under the security agreement, both setting forth the circumstances constituting the default under
the security agreement and stating that the secured party will at the expiration of a 30-day period
following receipt of the notice seek a court order removing the occupant from the manufactured
home and repossessing the manufactured home, unless the debtor or the occupant acting on behalf
of the debtor cures the default prior to that time and in the manner provided by section 327.66. If
notice is mailed to a debtor in accordance with this subdivision, the secured party by affidavit shall
set forth the circumstances causing the secured party to believe that the debtor could be reached at
the address to which the notice was mailed. The affidavit shall state that the secured party has no
reason to believe that the debtor might receive mailed notice at another address.
    (b) The notice must also state: "Your loan is currently in default. Contact us immediately at

counseling with the foreclosure prevention counselor in your area. Nearby community agencies will

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327.64, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

default, as described in subdivision 2, the secured party must send a registered certified letter to the
last known address of the debtor that the debtor has only 30 days to reinstate the loan by paying the
defaulted amount and any additional fees incurred by the secured party in order to regain possession
of the home prior to the court order. Nothing in this subdivision precludes a secured party from
proceeding with the other remedies provided to repossess the manufactured home.

    Sec. 4. [327.651] VOLUNTARY REPOSSESSION.
    The secured party and the debtor and occupant, if the debtor is not the occupant, may agree in
writing on a voluntary surrender of the title and possession of the manufactured home to the secured
party prior to or after the end of the 30-day period specified under section 327.64. The secured party

   A debtor, or an occupant of a manufactured home acting on behalf of a debtor, may within the
30 day period specified in the notices required by section 327.64, cure a default by tendering full
payment of the sums then in arrears under the terms of the security agreement, or by otherwise
remedying the default, and by paying the reasonable costs, not to exceed the sum of $       ­­15

incurred by the secured party to enforce the security agreement. Cure of a default in accordance
with the provisions of this section shall suspend the secured party's right to seek repossession of the
manufactured home under the provisions of sections 327.61 to 327.67. The secured party need not
accept any partial payment of the amount to which the secured party is entitled under this section.
The debtor, or an occupant of a manufactured home acting on behalf of the debtor, has no right to
cure the default after the expiration of the 30-day period specified under section 327.64.

arranging for a manufactured home loan when the new manufactured home loan does not provide
a reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances, including
the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan, and the borrower's
circumstances.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 13a. Manufactured home lender. "Manufactured home lender" means a person who

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327B.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 14b. Negative amortization. "Negative amortization" occurs when the borrower's
compliance with any repayment option offered pursuant to the terms of the manufactured home loan
is insufficient to satisfy the interest accruing on the loan, resulting in an increase in the loan balance.
Negative amortization does not occur when a manufactured home loan is originated, subsidized, or
guaranteed by or through a state, tribal, or local government, or nonprofit organization, and bears
one or more of the following nonstandard payment terms that substantially benefit the borrower:
   (1) payments vary with income;
    (2) payments of principal and interest are deferred until the maturity date of the loan or the sale
of the residence;

ability of the borrower to repay the loan, taking into consideration taxes and insurance in connection
with the manufactured home;
   (5) make, provide, or arrange for a manufactured home loan for a higher interest rate or on less
favorable terms than the rate or terms for which the borrower qualifies based on criteria typically
used by that lender to evaluate rate and term offerings;

foreclosure prevention services, loan counseling, or credit counseling certified by the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Minnesota Home Ownership Center, the
Minnesota Mortgage Foreclosure Prevention Association, AARP, or NeighborWorks America;
   (7) engage in churning; and
   (8) make, provide, or arrange for a manufactured home loan if the borrower's compliance with
any repayment option offered pursuant to the terms of the loan will result in negative amortization
during any six-month period. This excludes existing loan extensions and modifications.
    (b) This subdivision shall not apply to a state or federally chartered bank, savings bank, or credit
union, an institution chartered by Congress under the Farm Credit Act, or to a person making,

resolution procedure for insurance claims; imposing fees; proposing coding for new law in
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 72A.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [604.18] INSURANCE STANDARD OF CONDUCT.
   Subdivision 1. Terms. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings given
them.
    (a) "Insured" means a person who, or an entity which, qualifies as an insured under the terms of
an insurance policy on which a claim for coverage is made. An insured does not include any person
who, or entity which, has received any assignment of rights under an insurance policy, and does not
include any person or entity claiming a third-party beneficiary status under an insurance policy.
    (b) "Insurer" means every insurer, corporation, business trust, or association engaged in
insurance as principal licensed to transact insurance under section 60A.06, but for purposes of this
section an insurer does not include a political subdivision providing self-insurance or establishing
a pool under section 471.981, subdivision 3.
    (c) "Insurance policy" means a written agreement between an insured and an insurer, which
obligates an insurer to pay proceeds directly to the insured. Insurance policy does not include
provisions of a written agreement, which obligate an insurer to defend the insured, reimburse
an insured's defense expenses, provide for any other type of defense obligation, or provide for
indemnification for judgments or settlements. Insurance policy also does not include any written
agreement providing workers' compensation insurance under chapter 176, any written agreement
of a health carrier, as defined in section 62A.011, or any written agreement authorized under section
60A.06, subdivision 1, clauses (4) and (6).
    (d) "Vexatious" means conduct related to the payment of proceeds under an insurance policy,
which is deliberately arbitrary, capricious, frivolous, not supported by law or a valid extension of
law, and is without any expectation by the insurer that the conduct at issue is in good faith. A
disagreement between an insurer and an insured as to the value or amount of proceeds owed to an
insured is not vexatious conduct. An arson investigation or a fraud investigation is not vexatious
conduct. An insurer's reliance on the advice of counsel is not vexatious conduct.
    Subd. 2. Liability. (a) The court may award as taxable costs to an insured amounts as provided
in subdivision 3 if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that the insurer's conduct as a
matter of law is vexatious in the denial of or the delay of the payment of proceeds to an insured
under an insurance policy.
   (b) The insured is not entitled to taxable costs under this section if it is determined:
7136                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [88TH DAY

   (1) the insurer did not breach the insurance policy; or
   (2) the insured is not entitled to proceeds under the insurance policy in an amount that is in
excess of an amount offered by the insurer.
    (c) A violation of this section shall not be the basis for any claim or award under chapter 325D
or 325F.
    Subd. 3. Remedies. (a) An insured may be awarded either or both of the following amounts by
the court as taxable costs for an insurer's violation of subdivision 2:
   (1) an amount not exceeding the lesser of:
   (i) one-half of the proceeds awarded, which are in excess of an amount offered by the insurer; or
   (ii) $50,000; and
    (2) reasonable attorney fees actually incurred to establish the insurer's violation of this section.
Attorney fees shall only be awarded if the fees sought are separately accounted for by the insured's
attorney, are not duplicative of the fees the insured's attorney otherwise expends in pursuit of
proceeds to an insured under an insurance policy and which is in excess of an amount offered by
the insurer, and shall not exceed the lesser of:
   (i) one-half of the disputed amount of the proceeds sought from the insurer; or
   (ii) $20,000.
   (b) An award under this section precludes the insured's right to an award under sections 357.25;
549.02; 549.04; and 549.09, and under Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 68. An insured's
request to the court for an award under sections 357.25; 549.02; 549.04; and 549.09, or Minnesota
Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 68, shall preclude the insured from an award under this section.
    (c) An insured is not entitled to recover punitive or exemplary damages, or attorney fees under
section 8.31, because of any violation of this section.
    Subd. 4. Claim for taxable costs. (a) Upon commencement of a civil action by an insured against
an insurer, the complaint must not seek a recovery under this section. After filing the suit, a party
may make a motion to amend the pleadings to claim recovery of taxable costs under this section.
The motion must allege the applicable legal basis under this section for awarding taxable costs under
this section, and must be accompanied by one or more affidavits showing the factual basis for the
motion. The motion may be opposed by the submission of one or more affidavits showing there is
no factual basis for the motion. At the hearing, if the court finds prima facie clear and convincing
evidence in support of the motion, the court may grant the moving party permission to amend the
pleadings to claim taxable costs under this section.
    (b) An award of taxable costs under this section shall be determined by the court in a proceeding
subsequent to any determination as to whether the insured is entitled to any proceeds under the
insurance policy, and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in Minnesota Rules of General
Practice, rule 119.
   (c) An award of taxable costs under this section is not available in any claim that is subject to
any statutory or contractual arbitration, appraisal, or any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.

or any administrative rules promulgated thereunder;
   (2) allegations involving, or results of, investigations, examinations, or administrative
proceedings conducted by the Department of Commerce;

Department of Commerce;

admissible as standards of conduct to determine whether the insurer's conduct is vexatious; and
   (5) expert testimony opining what conduct may be considered vexatious.
    (e) Nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from asserting the defenses of waiver,
collateral or other estoppel, res judicata, or any other valid defense pursued under the section.

subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Compliance and investigations. (a) The commissioner of health shall, to the extent
practicable, seek the cooperation of health care providers and group purchasers in obtaining
compliance with this section and may provide technical assistance to health care providers and
group purchasers.
   (b) A person who believes a health care provider or group purchaser is not complying with the
requirements of this section may file a complaint with the commissioner of health. Complaints filed
under this section must meet the following requirements:
   (1) a complaint must be filed in writing, either on paper or electronically;
    (2) a complaint must name the person that is the subject of the complaint and describe the acts
or omissions believed to be in violation of this section;
   (3) a complaint must be filed within 180 days of when the complainant knew or should have
known that the act or omission complained of occurred; and
    (4) the commissioner may prescribe additional procedures for the filing of complaints as required
to satisfy the requirements of this section.
    (c) The commissioner of health may investigate complaints filed under this section. Such
investigation may include a review of the pertinent policies, procedures, or practices of the health
care provider or group purchaser and of the circumstances regarding any alleged violation. At the
time of initial written communication with the health care provider or group purchaser about the
complaint, the commissioner of health shall describe the acts or omissions that are the basis of the
complaint. The commissioner may conduct compliance reviews to determine whether health care
providers and group purchasers are complying with this section.
     (d) Health care providers and group purchasers must cooperate with the commissioner of health
if the commissioner undertakes an investigation or compliance review of the policies, procedures, or
practices of the health care provider or group purchaser to determine compliance with this section.
This cooperation includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) a health care provider or group purchaser must permit access by the commissioner of
health during normal business hours to its facilities, books, records, accounts, and other sources of
information that are pertinent to ascertaining compliance with this section;
    (2) if any information required of a health care provider or group purchaser under this section is in
the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person and the other agency, institution,
or person fails or refuses to furnish the information, the health care provider or group purchaser
must so certify and set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information; and
    (3) any individually identifiable health information obtained by the commissioner of health
in connection with an investigation or compliance review under this section may not be used
or disclosed by the commissioner of health, except as necessary for ascertaining or enforcing
compliance with this section.
   (e) If an investigation of a complaint indicates noncompliance, the commissioner of health

shall attempt to reach a resolution of the matter by informal means. Informal means may include
demonstrated compliance or a completed corrective action plan or other agreement. If the matter
is resolved by informal means, the commissioner of health shall inform the health care provider
or group purchaser and, if the matter arose from a complaint, the complainant, in writing. If the
matter is not resolved by informal means, the commissioner of health shall:
    (1) inform the health care provider or group purchaser and provide an opportunity for the health
care provider or group purchaser to submit written evidence of any mitigating factors or other
considerations. The health care provider or group purchaser must submit any such evidence to the
commissioner of health within 30 calendar days of receipt of such notification; and
    (2) inform the health care provider or group purchaser, through a notice of proposed
determination in accordance with paragraph (i), that the commissioner of health finds that a civil
money penalty should be imposed.
    (f) If, after an investigation or a compliance review, the commissioner of health determines that
further action is not warranted, the commissioner of health shall inform the health care provider or
group purchaser and, if the matter arose from a complaint, the complainant, in writing.
    (g) A health care provider or group purchaser may not threaten, intimidate, coerce, harass,
discriminate against, or take any other retaliatory action against any individual or other person for:
   (1) filing of a complaint under this section;
   (2) testifying, assisting, or participating in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding, or
contested case proceeding under this section; or
    (3) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by this section, provided the individual or
person has a good faith belief that the practice opposed is unlawful, and the manner of opposition
is reasonable and does not involve an unauthorized disclosure of a patient's health information.
    (h) The commissioner of health may impose a civil money penalty upon a health care provider
or group purchaser if the commissioner of health determines that the health care provider or group
purchaser has violated this section. If the commissioner of health determines that more than one
health care provider or group purchaser was responsible for a violation, the commissioner of health
may impose a civil money penalty against each such health care provider or group purchaser. The
amount of a civil money penalty shall be determined as follows:
   (1) the amount of a civil money penalty shall be $100 for each violation, but not to exceed
$25,000 for identical violations during a calendar year;
   (2) in the case of continuing violation of this section, a separate violation occurs each business
day that the health care provider or group purchaser is in violation of this section; and
   (3) in determining the amount of any civil money penalty, the commissioner of health may
consider as aggravating or mitigating factors, as appropriate, any of the following:
   (i) the nature of the violation, in light of the purpose of the goals of this section;

   (8) activities included in the employment plan that is developed under section 256J.521,
subdivision 3; and
    (9) preemployment activities including chemical and mental health assessments, treatment, and
services; learning disabilities services; child protective services; family stabilization services; or
other programs designed to enhance employability.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256J.521, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Self-employment. (a) Self-employment activities may be included in an employment
plan contingent on the development of a business plan which establishes a timetable and earning
goals that will result in the participant exiting MFIP assistance. Business plans must be developed
with assistance from an individual or organization with expertise in small business as approved by
the job counselor.
   (b) Participants with an approved plan that includes self-employment must meet the participation
requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1. Only hours where the participant earns at least
minimum wage shall be counted toward the requirement. Additional activities and hours necessary
to meet the participation requirements in section 256J.55, subdivision 1, must be included in the
employment plan.
   (c) Employment plans which include self-employment activities must be reviewed every three
months. Participants who fail, without good cause, to make satisfactory progress as established in the
business plan must revise the employment plan to replace the self-employment with other approved
work activities.

may find the petition states a prima facie case that:
      (i) the child's needs are being met;
      (ii) the placement of the child in foster care is in the best interests of the child;
      (iii) reasonable efforts to reunify the child and the parent or guardian are being made; and
      (iv) the child will be returned home in the next three months.
    (2) If the court makes findings under paragraph (1), the court shall approve the voluntary
arrangement and continue the matter for up to three more months to ensure the child returns to the
parents' home. The responsible social services agency shall:
    (i) report to the court when the child returns home and the progress made by the parent on the
out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, in which case the court shall dismiss
jurisdiction;
    (ii) report to the court that the child has not returned home, in which case the matter shall be
returned to the court for further proceedings under section 260C.163; or
    (iii) if any party does not agree to continue the matter under this paragraph and paragraph (1),
the matter shall proceed under section 260C.163."

     "Sec. 43. [260D.001] CHILD IN VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    (a) Sections 260D.001 to 260D.301, may be cited as the "child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" provisions of the Juvenile Court Act.
    (b) The juvenile court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment upon the filing of a report or petition required under this chapter. All obligations of
the agency to a child and family in foster care contained in chapter 260C not inconsistent with this
7168                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [88TH DAY

chapter are also obligations of the agency with regard to a child in foster care for treatment under
this chapter.
    (c) This chapter shall be construed consistently with the mission of the children's mental health
service system as set out in section 245.487, subdivision 3, and the duties of an agency under section
256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016, to meet the needs of a child with a
developmental disability or related condition. This chapter:
    (1) establishes voluntary foster care through a voluntary foster care agreement as the means for
an agency and a parent to provide needed treatment when the child must be in foster care to receive
necessary treatment for an emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition;
    (2) establishes court review requirements for a child in voluntary foster care for treatment due
to emotional disturbance or developmental disability or a related condition;
    (3) establishes the ongoing responsibility of the parent as legal custodian to visit the child, to
plan together with the agency for the child's treatment needs, to be available and accessible to the
agency to make treatment decisions, and to obtain necessary medical, dental, and other care for the
child; and
    (4) applies to voluntary foster care when the child's parent and the agency agree that the child's
treatment needs require foster care either:
   (i) due to a level of care determination by the agency's screening team informed by the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or
    (ii) due to a determination regarding the level of services needed by the responsible social
services' screening team under section 256B.092, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to
9525.0016.
    (d) This chapter does not apply when there is a current determination under section 626.556 that
the child requires child protective services or when the child is in foster care for any reason other
than treatment for the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition.
When there is a determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services
based on an assessment that there are safety and risk issues for the child that have not been mitigated
through the parent's engagement in services or otherwise, or when the child is in foster care for any
reason other than the child's emotional disturbance or developmental disability or related condition,
the provisions of chapter 260C apply.
    (e) The paramount consideration in all proceedings concerning a child in voluntary foster care
for treatment is the safety, health, and the best interests of the child. The purpose of this chapter is:
   (1) to ensure a child with a disability is provided the services necessary to treat or ameliorate the
symptoms of the child's disability;
    (2) to preserve and strengthen the child's family ties whenever possible and in the child's best
interests, approving the child's placement away from the child's parents only when the child's need
for care or treatment requires it and the child cannot be maintained in the home of the parent; and
   (3) to ensure the child's parent retains legal custody of the child and associated decision-making
authority unless the child's parent willfully fails or is unable to make decisions that meet the child's
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                         7169

safety, health, and best interests. The court may not find that the parent willfully fails or is unable
to make decisions that meet the child's needs solely because the parent disagrees with the agency's
choice of foster care facility, unless the agency files a petition under chapter 260C, and establishes
by clear and convincing evidence that the child is in need of protection or services.
    (f) The legal parent-child relationship shall be supported under this chapter by maintaining the
parent's legal authority and responsibility for ongoing planning for the child and by the agency's
assisting the parent, where necessary, to exercise the parent's ongoing right and obligation to visit
or to have reasonable contact with the child. Ongoing planning means:
   (1) actively participating in the planning and provision of educational services, medical, and
dental care for the child;
    (2) actively planning and participating with the agency and the foster care facility for the child's
treatment needs; and
    (3) planning to meet the child's need for safety, stability, and permanency, and the child's need
to stay connected to the child's family and community.
     (g) The provisions of section 260.012 to ensure placement prevention, family reunification, and
all active and reasonable effort requirements of that section apply. This chapter shall be construed
consistently with the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code,
title 25, section 1901, et.al., and the provisions of the Minnesota Indian Family Preservation Act,
sections 260.751 to 260.835.
   Sec. 44. [260D.005] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section supplement the definitions in section

260C.212, subdivision 1; 626.556, subdivision 10; and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to
9525.0016.
   Subd. 4. Child. "Child" means an individual under 18 years of age.
    Subd. 5. Child in voluntary foster care for treatment. "Child in voluntary foster care for
treatment" means a child who is emotionally disturbed or developmentally disabled or has a related
condition and is in foster care under a voluntary foster care agreement between the child's parent
and the agency due to concurrence between the agency and the parent that the child's level of care
requires placement in foster care either:
   (1) due to a determination by the agency's screening team based on its review of the diagnostic
and functional assessment under section 245.4885; or

7170                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [88TH DAY

Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0016.
    A child is not in voluntary foster care for treatment under this chapter when there is a current
determination under section 626.556 that the child requires child protective services or when the
child is in foster care for any reason other than the child's emotional or developmental disability or
related condition.
    Subd. 6. Compelling reasons. "Compelling reasons" has the same meaning as it is used in
section 260C.007, subdivision 8. The agency may determine compelling reasons when the child
is in foster care for treatment and no grounds to terminate parental rights exist because the child
must be in placement to access treatment, the child's individual treatment needs cannot be met in
the child's home or through community-based care, and the parent continues to be responsible for
planning together with the agency for the child's needs and maintains appropriate contact with the
child.
   Subd. 7. Court. "Court" means juvenile court unless otherwise specified in this section.
    Subd. 8. Developmental disability. "Developmental disability" means developmental disability

15.
    Subd. 10. Foster care. "Foster care" means 24-hour substitute care for children placed away
from their parents and for whom an agency has placement and care responsibility. Foster care
includes, but is not limited to, placement in foster family homes, foster homes of relatives, group
homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities not excluded in this subdivision, child care
institutions, and preadoptive homes. A child is in foster care under this definition, regardless of
whether the facility is licensed and payments are made for the cost of care. Nothing in this definition
creates any authority to place a child in a home or facility that is required to be licensed that is
not licensed. Foster care does not include placement in any of the following facilities: hospitals,
inpatient chemical dependency treatment facilities, facilities that are primarily for delinquent
children, any corrections facility or program within a particular corrections facility not meeting
requirements for Title IV-E facilities as determined by the commissioner, facilities to which a child
is committed under the provision of chapter 253B, forestry camps, or jails.
    Subd. 11. Legal authority to place the child. "Legal authority to place the child" means the
agency has legal responsibility for the care and control of the child while the child is in foster care.
The agency may acquire legal authority to place a child through a voluntary placement agreement
between the agency and the child's parent under this chapter. Legal authority to place the child does
not mean the agency has authority to make major life decisions regarding the child, including major
medical decisions. A parent with legal custody of the child continues to have legal authority to make
major life decisions regarding the child, including major medical decisions.
   Subd. 12. Minor. "Minor" means an individual under 18 years of age.
    Subd. 13. Parent. "Parent" means the birth or adoptive parent of a minor. Parent also means the
child's legal guardian or any individual who has legal authority to make decisions and plans for the
child. For an Indian child, parent includes any Indian person who has adopted a child by tribal law

or custom, as provided in section 260.755, subdivision 14.
     Subd. 14. Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanent plan for the child. "Reasonable efforts
to finalize a permanent plan for the child" has the same meaning under this chapter as provided in
section 260.012, paragraph (e).
    Sec. 45. [260D.101] VOLUNTARY FOSTER CARE.
    Subdivision 1. Voluntary foster care. When the agency's screening team, based upon
the diagnostic and functional assessment under section 245.4885 or 256B.092, subdivision 7,
determines the child's need for treatment due to emotional disturbance or developmental disability
or related condition requires foster care placement of the child, a voluntary foster care agreement
between the child's parent and the agency gives the agency legal authority to place the child in
foster care.
    Subd. 2. Voluntary foster care agreement. A voluntary foster care agreement shall be used
to provide the agency the legal authority to place a child in foster care for treatment due to the
child's disability. The agreement must be in writing and signed by both the child's parent and the
agency. The agreement must be in a form approved by the commissioner of human services, and
shall contain notice to parents of the consequences to the parent and to the child of being in voluntary
foster care.
  Sec. 46. [260D.102] REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR A CHILD IN VOLUNTARY
FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    An agency with authority to place a child in voluntary foster care for treatment due to emotional
disturbance or developmental disability or related condition, shall inform the child, age 12 or older,
of the following:
    (1) the child has the right to be consulted in the preparation of the out-of-home placement
plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1, and the administrative review required under
section 260C.212, subdivision 7;
    (2) the child has the right to visit the parent and the right to visit the child's siblings as determined
safe and appropriate by the parent and the agency;
    (3) if the child disagrees with the foster care facility or services provided under the out-of-home
placement plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1, the agency shall include information
about the nature of the child's disagreement and, to the extent possible, the agency's understanding
of the basis of the child's disagreement in the information provided to the court in the report required
under section 260D.105; and
    (4) the child has the rights established under Minnesota Rules, part 2960.0050, as a resident of
a facility licensed by the state.
  Sec. 47. [260D.103] ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF CHILD IN VOLUNTARY
FOSTER CARE FOR TREATMENT.
    The administrative reviews required under section 260C.212, subdivision 7, must be conducted
for a child in voluntary foster care for treatment, except that the initial administrative review must
take place prior to the submission of the report to the court required under section 260D.105,

   (2) the child's name, date of birth, race, gender, and current address;
    (3) the names, race, date of birth, residence, and post office addresses of the child's parents or
legal custodian;
   (4) a statement regarding the child's eligibility for membership or enrollment in an Indian tribe
and the agency's compliance with applicable provisions of sections 260.751 to 260.835;

section 260C.163, subdivision 5.
   Sec. 49. [260D.107] REQUIRED PERMANENCY REVIEW HEARING.
    (a) When the court has found that the voluntary arrangement is in the child's best interests and that
the agency and parent are appropriately planning for the child pursuant to the report submitted under
section 260D.105, and the child continues in voluntary foster care as defined in section 260D.005,
subdivision 10, for 13 months from the date of the voluntary foster care agreement, or has been in
placement for 15 of the last 22 months, the agency must:
   (1) terminate the voluntary foster care agreement and return the child home; or
    (2) determine whether there are compelling reasons to continue the voluntary foster care
arrangement and, if the agency determines there are compelling reasons, seek judicial approval of
its determination; or
   (3) file a petition for the termination of parental rights.
     (b) When the agency is asking for the court's approval of its determination that there are
compelling reasons to continue the child in the voluntary foster care arrangement, the agency shall
file a "Petition for Permanency Review Regarding a Child in Voluntary Foster Care for Treatment"
and ask the court to proceed under this section.
   (c) The "Petition for Permanency Review Regarding a Child in Voluntary Foster Care for
Treatment" shall be drafted or approved by the county attorney and be under oath. The petition
shall include:
   (1) the date of the voluntary placement agreement;
   (2) whether the petition is due to the child's developmental disability or emotional disturbance;

    (5) the date of the court finding that the foster care placement was in the best interests of the
child, if required under section 260D.105, or the date the agency filed the motion under section
260D.201, paragraph (b);
    (6) the agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the child, including returning
the child to the care of the child's family; and
   (7) a citation to this chapter as the basis for the petition.
   (d) An updated copy of the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212,
subdivision 1, shall be filed with the petition.
    (e) The court shall set the date for the permanency review hearing no later than 14 months after
the child has been in placement or within 30 days of the petition filing date when the child has been
in placement 15 of the last 22 months. The court shall serve the petition together with a notice of
hearing by United States mail on the parent, the child age 12 or older, the child's guardian ad litem,
if one has been appointed, the agency, the county attorney, and counsel for any party.
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                          7175

    (f) The court shall conduct the permanency review hearing on the petition no later than 14 months
after the date of the voluntary placement agreement, within 30 days of the filing of the petition when
the child has been in placement 15 days of the last 22 months, or within 15 days of a motion to
terminate jurisdiction and to dismiss an order for foster care under chapter 260C, as provided in
section 260D.201, paragraph (b).
   (g) At the permanency review hearing, the court shall:
   (1) inquire of the parent if the parent has reviewed the "Petition for Permanency Review
Regarding a Child in Voluntary Foster Care for Treatment," whether the petition is accurate, and
whether the parent agrees to the continued voluntary foster care arrangement as being in the child's
best interests;
    (2) inquire of the parent if the parent is satisfied with the agency's reasonable efforts to finalize
the permanent plan for the child, including whether there are services available and accessible to
the parent that might allow the child to safely be with the child's family;
   (3) inquire of the parent if the parent consents to the court entering an order that:
    (i) approves the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent plan for the
child, which includes ongoing future planning for the safety, health, and best interest of the child;
and
   (ii) approves the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling reasons why the
continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interest; and
   (4) inquire of the child's guardian ad litem and any other party whether the guardian or the party
agrees that:
    (i) the court should approve the responsible agency's reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent
plan for the child, which includes ongoing and future planning for the safety, health, and best
interests of the child; and
    (ii) the court should approve of the responsible agency's determination that there are compelling
reasons why the continued voluntary foster care arrangement is in the child's best interests.
   (h) At a permanency review hearing under this section, the court may take the following actions
based on the contents of the sworn petition and the consent of the parent:
   (1) approve the agency's compelling reasons that the voluntary foster care arrangement is in the
best interests of the child; and
    (2) find that the agency has made reasonable efforts to finalize a plan for the permanent plan for
the child.
    (i) A child, age 12 or older, may object to the agency's request that the court approve its
compelling reasons for the continued voluntary arrangement and may be heard on the reasons
for the objection. Notwithstanding the child's objection, the court may approve the agency's
compelling reasons and the voluntary arrangement.
    (j) If the court does not approve the voluntary arrangement after hearing from the child or the
child's guardian ad litem, the court shall dismiss the petition. In this case, either:

   (1) the child must be returned to the care of the parent; or
    (2) the agency must file a petition under section 260C.141, asking for appropriate relief under
section 260C.201, subdivision 11, or 260C.301.
    (k) When the court approves the agency's compelling reasons for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, and finds that the agency has made reasonable efforts to
finalize a permanent plan for the child, the court shall approve the continued voluntary foster care
arrangement, and continue the matter under the court's jurisdiction for the purposes of reviewing
the child's placement every 12 months while the child is in foster care.
   (l) A finding that the court approves the continued voluntary placement means the agency has
continued legal authority to place the child while a voluntary placement agreement remains in effect.
The parent or the agency may terminate a voluntary agreement as provided in section 260D.301.
Termination of a voluntary foster care placement of an Indian child is governed by section 260.765,
subdivision 4.
   Sec. 50. [260D.109] ANNUAL REVIEW.
   (a) After the court conducts a permanency review hearing under section 260D.107, the matter
must be returned to the court for further review of the child's foster care placement at least every
12 months while the child is in foster care. The court shall give notice to the parent and child, age
12 or older, and the foster parents of the continued review requirements under this section at the
permanency review hearing.
    (b) Every 12 months, the court shall determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to
finalize the permanency plan for the child, which means the exercise of due diligence by the agency
to:
    (1) ensure that the agreement for voluntary foster care is the most appropriate legal arrangement
to meet the child's safety, health, and best interests;
    (2) engage and support the parent in continued involvement in planning and decision making
for the needs of the child;
   (3) strengthen the child's ties to the parent, relatives, and community;
   (4) implement the out-of-home placement plan required under section 260C.212, subdivision 1,
and ensure that the plan requires the provision of appropriate services to address the physical health,
mental health, and educational needs of the child; and
    (5) ensure appropriate planning for the child's safe, permanent, and independent living
arrangement after the child's 18th birthday.
  Sec. 51. [260D.201] PERMANENCY REVIEW AFTER ADJUDICATION UNDER
CHAPTER 260C.
    (a) If a child has been ordered into foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision
1, and the conditions that led to the court's order have been corrected so that the child could safely
return home except for the child's need to continue in foster care for treatment due to the child's
disability, the child's parent and the agency may enter into a voluntary foster care agreement under
this chapter using the procedure set out in paragraph (b).
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                          7177

   (b) When the agency and the parent agree to enter into a voluntary foster care agreement
under this chapter, the agency must file a motion to terminate jurisdiction under section 260C.193,
subdivision 6, and to dismiss the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1, together with the petition required under section 260D.107, paragraph (b), for
permanency review and the court's approval of the voluntary arrangement.
    (c) The court shall send the motion and the petition filed under subdivision 2 together with a
notice of hearing by mail as required in section 260D.107, paragraph (e).
    (d) The petition and motion under this section must be filed no later than the time the agency is
required to file a petition for permanent placement under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, but may
be filed as soon as the agency and the parent agree that the child should remain in foster care under
a voluntary foster care agreement, because the child needs treatment and voluntary foster care is in
the child's best interest.
    (e) In order for the agency to have continuous legal authority to place the child, the parent and the
agency must execute a voluntary foster care agreement for the child's continuation in foster care for
treatment prior to the termination of the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201,
subdivision 1. The parent and agency may execute the voluntary foster care agreement at or before
the permanency review hearing required under this section. The voluntary foster care agreement
shall not be effective until the court terminates jurisdiction under section 260C.193, subdivision 6,
and dismisses the order for foster care under section 260C.178 or 260C.201, subdivision 1. Unless
the agency and the parent execute a voluntary placement agreement for the child to continue in
voluntary foster care for treatment, the agency shall not have legal authority to place the child after
the court terminates jurisdiction under chapter 260C.
   Sec. 52. [260D.301] TERMINATION OF VOLUNTARY PLACEMENT AGREEMENT.
    (a) The child's parent may terminate a voluntary placement agreement under this chapter upon
written notice to the agency of the termination of the agreement. The termination of a voluntary
foster care agreement regarding an Indian child shall be governed by section 260.765, subdivision
4.
    (b) The agency may terminate a voluntary placement agreement under this section upon written
notice of the termination of the agreement to the parent. Prior to sending notice of termination of the
voluntary foster care placement agreement, the agency shall contact the parent regarding transition
planning under paragraph (e). Written notice by the agency shall be considered received by the
parent three business days after mailing by the agency.
    (c) Upon receipt of notice of the termination of the voluntary foster care agreement, the agency,
the parent, and the facility may agree to a time that the child shall return home. The scheduled time
to return home shall meet the child's need for safety and reasonable transition. Unless otherwise
agreed by the parent and the agency, the child's return home shall not occur sooner than 72 hours
and not later than 30 days after written notice of termination is received or sent by the agency.
    (d) A parent who disagrees with the termination of a voluntary foster care agreement by the
agency under this chapter has the right to a fair hearing under section 256.045 to appeal the
termination of the voluntary foster care agreement. When the agency gives written notice to the
parent of the termination of the agreement, the agency must also give the parent notice of the
parent's right to a fair hearing under section 256.045 to appeal the agency's decision to terminate
7178                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [88TH DAY

the voluntary foster care agreement.
    (e) The agency and the child's parents shall engage in transition planning for the child's return
home, including establishing a scheduled time for the child to return home, an increased visitation
plan between the parent and child, and a plan for what services will be provided and in place upon
the child's return home.
    (f) Notice of termination of voluntary foster care agreement does not terminate the agreement.
The voluntary foster care agreement and the agency's legal authority to place the child are terminated
by the child's return home or by court order."

read:
    Subd. 3. Ten-year bar to set aside disqualification. (a) The commissioner may not set aside
the disqualification of an individual in connection with a license to provide family child care
for children, foster care for children in the provider's home, or foster care or day care services

    (b) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten years
have passed since the individual's aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy to commit any of the
offenses listed in paragraph (a) as each of these offenses is defined in Minnesota Statutes.
    (c) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten
years have passed since the discharge of the sentence imposed for an offense in any other state or
country, the elements of which are substantially similar to the elements of any of the offenses listed
in paragraph (a).
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 245C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Fair hearing when disqualification is not set aside. (a) If the commissioner
does not set aside a disqualification of an individual under section 245C.22 who is disqualified on

or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; for a determination
under section 626.556 or 626.557 of substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring under
section 245C.15; or for failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3; or
626.557, subdivision 3, pursuant to section 245C.15, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (1), the
individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the disqualification is deemed
conclusive under section 245C.29.
    (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the
right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction or admission to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4, or for a
disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision under section
245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual
and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified based on a
judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.

individual who was disqualified based on both ­a­p

a conviction or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the
disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the hearing conducted
under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.

     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.29, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Conclusive disqualification determination. (a) Unless otherwise specified in statute,
a determination that:
   (1) the information the commissioner relied upon to disqualify an individual under section
245C.14 was correct based on serious or recurring maltreatment;

                               t­­e clear and convincing evidence shows that the individual committed
an act or acts that meet the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15. A police report
or criminal complaint alone does not meet this standard; or
   (3) the individual failed to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or
626.557, subdivision 3, is conclusive if:
   (i) the commissioner has issued a final order in an appeal of that determination under section
245A.08, subdivision 5, or 256.045, or a court has issued a final decision;
     (ii) the individual did not request reconsideration of the disqualification under section 245C.21;
or
   (iii) the individual did not request a hearing on the disqualification under section 256.045 or
chapter 14.
    (b) When a licensing action under section 245A.05, 245A.06, or 245A.07 is based on the
disqualification of an individual in connection with a license to provide family child care, foster
care for children in the provider's own home, or foster care services for adults in the provider's own
home, that disqualification shall be conclusive for purposes of the licensing action if a request for
reconsideration was not submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice
of disqualification.
   (c) If a determination that the information relied upon to disqualify an individual was correct
and is conclusive under this section, and the individual is subsequently disqualified under section
245C.15, the individual has a right to request reconsideration on the risk of harm under section
245C.21. Subsequent determinations regarding the risk of harm shall be made according to section
245C.22 and are not subject to another hearing under section 256.045 or chapter 14.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.045, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. State agency hearings. (a) State agency hearings are available for the following: (1)
any person applying for, receiving or having received public assistance, medical care, or a program
of social services granted by the state agency or a county agency or the federal Food Stamp Act
whose application for assistance is denied, not acted upon with reasonable promptness, or whose
assistance is suspended, reduced, terminated, or claimed to have been incorrectly paid; (2) any
patient or relative aggrieved by an order of the commissioner under section 252.27; (3) a party
aggrieved by a ruling of a prepaid health plan; (4) except as provided under chapter 245C, any
individual or facility determined by a lead agency to have maltreated a vulnerable adult under
section 626.557 after they have exercised their right to administrative reconsideration under section
626.557; (5) any person whose claim for foster care payment according to a placement of the child
resulting from a child protection assessment under section 626.556 is denied or not acted upon
with reasonable promptness, regardless of funding source; (6) any person to whom a right of appeal

decision to an application for a hardship waiver under section 256B.15; (8) an applicant aggrieved
by an adverse decision to an application or redetermination for a Medicare Part D prescription
drug subsidy under section 256B.04, subdivision 4a; (9) except as provided under chapter 245A,
an individual or facility determined to have maltreated a minor under section 626.556, after the
individual or facility has exercised the right to administrative reconsideration under section 626.556;

and 245C.15, on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment; ­     a­p

convincing evidence that the individual has committed an act or acts that meet the definition of any
of the crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4; or for failing to make reports required
under section 626.556, subdivision 3, or 626.557, subdivision 3. Hearings regarding a maltreatment
determination under clause (4) or (9) and a disqualification under this clause in which the basis for
a disqualification is serious or recurring maltreatment, which has not been set aside under sections
245C.22 and 245C.23, shall be consolidated into a single fair hearing. In such cases, the scope of
review by the human services referee shall include both the maltreatment determination and the
disqualification. The failure to exercise the right to an administrative reconsideration shall not be
a bar to a hearing under this section if federal law provides an individual the right to a hearing to
dispute a finding of maltreatment. Individuals and organizations specified in this section may contest
the specified action, decision, or final disposition before the state agency by submitting a written
request for a hearing to the state agency within 30 days after receiving written notice of the action,
decision, or final disposition, or within 90 days of such written notice if the applicant, recipient,
patient, or relative shows good cause why the request was not submitted within the 30-day time
limit.
    The hearing for an individual or facility under clause (4), (9), or (10) is the only administrative
appeal to the final agency determination specifically, including a challenge to the accuracy and
completeness of data under section 13.04. Hearings requested under clause (4) apply only to
incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after October 1, 1995. Hearings requested by nursing
assistants in nursing homes alleged to have maltreated a resident prior to October 1, 1995, shall be
held as a contested case proceeding under the provisions of chapter 14. Hearings requested under
clause (9) apply only to incidents of maltreatment that occur on or after July 1, 1997. A hearing
for an individual or facility under clause (9) is only available when there is no juvenile court or
adult criminal action pending. If such action is filed in either court while an administrative review
is pending, the administrative review must be suspended until the judicial actions are completed.
If the juvenile court action or criminal charge is dismissed or the criminal action overturned, the
matter may be considered in an administrative hearing.
   For purposes of this section, bargaining unit grievance procedures are not an administrative
appeal.
    The scope of hearings involving claims to foster care payments under clause (5) shall be limited
to the issue of whether the county is legally responsible for a child's placement under court order
or voluntary placement agreement and, if so, the correct amount of foster care payment to be made
on the child's behalf and shall not include review of the propriety of the county's child protection
determination or child placement decision.
   (b) A vendor of medical care as defined in section 256B.02, subdivision 7, or a vendor under
contract with a county agency to provide social services is not a party and may not request a hearing

   (c) An applicant or recipient is not entitled to receive social services beyond the services
prescribed under chapter 256M or other social services the person is eligible for under state law.

     Subd. 3b. Standard of evidence for maltreatment and disqualification hearings. (a) The
state human services referee shall determine that maltreatment has occurred if a preponderance of

    (1) a preponderance of the evidence shows the individual has committed maltreatment under
section 626.556 or 626.557, which is serious or recurring;
    (2) clear and convincing evidence shows the individual has committed an act or acts meeting
the definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4; or
    (3) a preponderance of the evidence shows the individual has failed to make required reports
under section 626.556 or 626.557, for incidents in which the final disposition under section 626.556
or 626.557 was substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring.
    (b) If the disqualification is affirmed, the state human services referee shall determine whether the
individual poses a risk of harm in accordance with the requirements of section 245C.16, and whether
the disqualification should be set aside or not set aside. In determining whether the disqualification
should be set aside, the human services referee shall consider all of the characteristics that cause
the individual to be disqualified, including those characteristics that were not subject to review
under paragraph (a), in order to determine whether the individual poses a risk of harm. A decision
to set aside a disqualification that is the subject of the hearing constitutes a determination that
the individual does not pose a risk of harm and that the individual may provide direct contact
services in the individual program specified in the set aside. If a determination that the information
relied upon to disqualify an individual was correct and is conclusive under section 245C.29, and
the individual is subsequently disqualified under section 245C.14, the individual has a right to
again request reconsideration on the risk of harm under section 245C.21. Subsequent determinations
regarding risk of harm are not subject to another hearing under this section.
    (c) The state human services referee shall recommend an order to the commissioner of health,
education, or human services, as applicable, who shall issue a final order. The commissioner shall
affirm, reverse, or modify the final disposition. Any order of the commissioner issued in accordance
with this subdivision is conclusive upon the parties unless appeal is taken in the manner provided in
subdivision 7. In any licensing appeal under chapters 245A and 245C and sections 144.50 to 144.58
and 144A.02 to 144A.46, the commissioner's determination as to maltreatment is conclusive, as
provided under section 245C.29."

   (e) Assist and actively cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, local, state,
and federal, by performing services in conformity with the purposes of Laws 1939, chapter 431.
    (f) Act as the agent of and cooperate with the federal government in matters of mutual concern
relative to and in conformity with the provisions of Laws 1939, chapter 431, including the
administration of any federal funds granted to the state to aid in the performance of any functions
of the commissioner as specified in Laws 1939, chapter 431, and including the promulgation of
rules making uniformly available medical care benefits to all recipients of public assistance, at such
times as the federal government increases its participation in assistance expenditures for medical

   (g) Establish and maintain any administrative units reasonably necessary for the performance of
administrative functions common to all divisions of the department.
    (h) Act as designated guardian of both the estate and the person of all the wards of the state

proceeding whatever, except as to persons committed as developmentally disabled. For children
under the guardianship of the commissioner or a tribe in Minnesota recognized by the Secretary
of the Interior whose interests would be best served by adoptive placement, the commissioner
may contract with a licensed child-placing agency or a Minnesota tribal social services agency
to provide adoption services. A contract with a licensed child-placing agency must be designed
to supplement existing county efforts and may not replace existing county programs or tribal
social services, unless the replacement is agreed to by the county board and the appropriate
exclusive bargaining representative, tribal governing body, or the commissioner has evidence that
child placements of the county continue to be substantially below that of other counties. Funds
encumbered and obligated under an agreement for a specific child shall remain available until the
terms of the agreement are fulfilled or the agreement is terminated.
   (i) Act as coordinating referral and informational center on requests for service for newly arrived
immigrants coming to Minnesota.
   (j) The specific enumeration of powers and duties as hereinabove set forth shall in no way be

    (l) Have the authority to conduct and administer experimental projects to test methods and
procedures of administering assistance and services to recipients or potential recipients of public
welfare. To carry out such experimental projects, it is further provided that the commissioner
of human services is authorized to waive the enforcement of existing specific statutory program
requirements, rules, and standards in one or more counties. The order establishing the waiver
shall provide alternative methods and procedures of administration, shall not be in conflict with
the basic purposes, coverage, or benefits provided by law, and in no event shall the duration of a

project exceed four years. It is further provided that no order establishing an experimental project
as authorized by the provisions of this section shall become effective until the following conditions
have been met:
   (1) the secretary of health and human services of the United States has agreed, for the same
project, to waive state plan requirements relative to statewide uniformity; and
  (2) a comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs, shall be approved by the Legislative
Advisory Commission and filed with the commissioner of administration.
   (m) According to federal requirements, establish procedures to be followed by local welfare
boards in creating citizen advisory committees, including procedures for selection of committee
members.
    (n) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions which are based on quality control error
rates for the aid to families with dependent children program formerly codified in sections 256.72
to 256.87, medical assistance, or food stamp program in the following manner:
    (1) one-half of the total amount of the disallowance shall be borne by the county boards
responsible for administering the programs. For the medical assistance and the AFDC program
formerly codified in sections 256.72 to 256.87, disallowances shall be shared by each county
board in the same proportion as that county's expenditures for the sanctioned program are to the
total of all counties' expenditures for the AFDC program formerly codified in sections 256.72 to
256.87, and medical assistance programs. For the food stamp program, sanctions shall be shared
by each county board, with 50 percent of the sanction being distributed to each county in the same
proportion as that county's administrative costs for food stamps are to the total of all food stamp
administrative costs for all counties, and 50 percent of the sanctions being distributed to each
county in the same proportion as that county's value of food stamp benefits issued are to the total
of all benefits issued for all counties. Each county shall pay its share of the disallowance to the
state of Minnesota. When a county fails to pay the amount due hereunder, the commissioner may
deduct the amount from reimbursement otherwise due the county, or the attorney general, upon the
request of the commissioner, may institute civil action to recover the amount due; and
    (2) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (1), if the disallowance results from knowing
noncompliance by one or more counties with a specific program instruction, and that knowing
noncompliance is a matter of official county board record, the commissioner may require payment
or recover from the county or counties, in the manner prescribed in clause (1), an amount equal to
the portion of the total disallowance which resulted from the noncompliance, and may distribute
the balance of the disallowance according to clause (1).
    (o) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the
recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may
enter into contracts with third parties. Any recoveries that result from projects or contracts entered
into under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account
until the balance in the account reaches $1,000,000. When the balance in the account exceeds
$1,000,000, the excess shall be transferred and credited to the general fund. All money in the
account is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (p) Have the authority to make direct payments to facilities providing shelter to women and their
children according to section 256D.05, subdivision 3. Upon the written request of a shelter facility
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                         7193

that has been denied payments under section 256D.05, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall review
all relevant evidence and make a determination within 30 days of the request for review regarding
issuance of direct payments to the shelter facility. Failure to act within 30 days shall be considered
a determination not to issue direct payments.
   (q) Have the authority to establish and enforce the following county reporting requirements:
    (1) the commissioner shall establish fiscal and statistical reporting requirements necessary to
account for the expenditure of funds allocated to counties for human services programs. When
establishing financial and statistical reporting requirements, the commissioner shall evaluate all
reports, in consultation with the counties, to determine if the reports can be simplified or the number
of reports can be reduced;
    (2) the county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required
by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the
month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless
the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid
jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports
that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner;
   (3) if the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (2), the
commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next
reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late
report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county
boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal
funding is received;
    (4) a county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required
format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county
board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason
the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective
action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan
must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received
notice of noncompliance;
    (5) the final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date
the report was originally due. If the commissioner does not receive a report by the final deadline, the
county board forfeits the funding associated with the report for that reporting period and the county
board must repay any funds associated with the report received for that reporting period;
     (6) the commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under
clause (3) or (5) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate
forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements.
If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5), the
county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69; and
   (7) counties subject to withholding of funds under clause (3) or forfeiture or repayment of funds
under clause (5) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred
due to actions taken by the commissioner under clause (3) or (5).

                                  I-35W BRIDGE COLLAPSE
88TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                          7203

   Section 1. COMPENSATION FOR VICTIMS OF I-35W BRIDGE COLLAPSE.
    Subdivision 1. Findings. (a) The legislature finds that the collapse of the Interstate Highway
35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007, was a catastrophe of
historic proportions. The bridge was the third-busiest in the state, carrying over 140,000 cars per
day. Its collapse killed 13 people and injured more than 100. No other state-owned structure has
ever fallen with such devastating physical and psychological impact on so many.
    (b) The establishment of a compensation process for victims of the bridge collapse furthers
the public interest by providing a remedy for victims while avoiding the uncertainty and expense
of potentially complex and protracted litigation to resolve the issue of the liability of the state, a
municipality, or their employees for damages incurred by victims.
    (c) These findings are not an admission of liability of the state, a municipality, or their employees
for damages caused by the bride collapse.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this article:
    (a) "Damages" means damages that are compensable under state tort law and damages for
wrongful death that are compensable under Minnesota Statutes, section 573.02. Damages do not
include punitive damages or attorney fees or other fees incurred by a victim in making a claim
under this section or other law.
   (b) "Emergency relief fund" means the I-35W bridge emergency relief fund created by the state
on November 30, 2007.
   (c) "Municipality" has the meaning given in Minnesota Statutes, section 466.01.
   (d) "Panel" means the special master panel created under subdivision 3.
   (e) "State" has the meaning given in Minnesota Statutes, section 3.732.
    (f) "Victim" means a natural person who was present on the I-35W bridge at the time of the
collapse. Victim also includes:
   (1) the parent or legal guardian of a victim who is under 18 years of age;
   (2) a legally appointed representative of a victim; or
   (3) the surviving spouse or next of kin of a victim who would be entitled to bring an action under
Minnesota Statutes, section 573.02.
    Subd. 3. Special master panel; administration. (a) The chief justice of the Supreme Court
shall establish a special master panel to consider claims, make offers of settlement, and enter
into settlement agreements with victims on behalf of the state. The panel must consist of three
attorneys, at least one of whom must be a retired judge of the appellate or district courts of this state.
Nonjudicial members of the panel must have experience in legal issues involving the settlement of
tort claims and the determination of damages. The chief justice shall designate a member of the
panel who is a retired judge to serve as chair of the panel. The chief justice shall determine the pay
and expenses to be received by the panel.
   (b) Within the limits of available appropriations, the state court administrator, in consultation
7204                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [88TH DAY

with the panel, shall hire employees or retain consultants necessary to assist the panel in performing
its duties under this section. Employees are in the unclassified state civil service. The panel may
also use current state employees or consultants who are under a contract with the state to assist the
panel in processing claims under this section.
    (c) The panel may adopt procedures, rules, and forms for considering claims, making offers of
settlement, and entering into settlement agreements.
   (d) The state court administrator shall forward documentation of salaries, expenses, and
administrative costs under this subdivision to the commissioner of finance for payment of those
amounts.
    (e) Members of the panel and employees and consultants acting under the direction of the panel
are absolutely immune from civil liability for any act or omission occurring within the scope of the
performance of their duties under this section.
    Subd. 4. Claims; consideration, settlement, and payment. (a) The panel shall consider claims,
make offers of settlement, and enter into settlement agreements with victims as provided in this
section. In order to be eligible to receive an offer of settlement or enter into a settlement agreement
under this section, a victim must file a claim with the panel by October 1, 2008. Any offer of
settlement must be made by April 1, 2009.
   (b) The amount of an offer of settlement under this section must be based on the total damages
incurred by the victim, less:
    (1) a collateral source reduction calculated in the manner provided for in Minnesota Statutes,
section 548.36;
   (2) any payment made to the victim from the emergency relief fund; and
    (3) any payments made or required to be made to the victim by a third-party tortfeasor under the
terms of an existing settlement or other agreement with the victim or a final judgment in favor of
the victim concerning claims of the victim that relate to, involve, or arise out of the bridge collapse.
    The amount of an offer of settlement or payment required by a settlement agreement must not
exceed $400,000 per victim. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 3.736, subdivision 4,
clause (e), there is no limit on the total amount of payments made to all victims under this section,
subject to the availability of appropriations for this purpose.
    (c) A victim who accepts an offer of settlement from the panel must agree in writing and in
a form developed by the panel to release the state and every municipality of this state and their
employees from liability for damages arising from the bridge collapse and to cooperate with the
state in pursuing claims the state may have against any other party. The panel shall consult with
the attorney general in preparing the form. Execution of the release by the victim extinguishes any
claim against or liability of the state, a municipality, and their employees for damages asserted by
a spouse or other family member of a victim based on payments made or services provided to or
on behalf of the victim for damages or injury that relates to, involves, or arises out of the bridge
collapse. The release must also provide that the victim will indemnify the state, a municipality, and
their employees for any claim of contribution or indemnity, or both, made by other persons against
the state, a municipality, and their employees and the release will satisfy any judgment obtained by
the victim in an action against other persons to the extent of the release, if the claim or judgment
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                          7205

relates in any way to a claim of the victim arising from the bridge collapse. The release must provide
for the subrogation interest of the state under section 2, subdivision 5.
    (d) The panel shall promptly forward to the commissioner of finance documentation of each
settlement agreement that has been entered into under this section. The commissioner of finance
shall pay the agreed amount within 30 days after receiving the documentation and in the order in
which the documentation from the panel was received.
    Subd. 5. Effect and finality of offers and settlement agreements. (a) An offer of settlement
made to a victim under this section is considered for all purposes to be an offer to the victim to settle
a legal claim.
   (b) A determination by the panel regarding an offer of settlement or settlement agreement is final
and not subject to judicial review.
    Subd. 6. Records. Records of the panel related to a claim filed by a victim, an offer of settlement,
or an acceptance or rejection of an offer are not accessible to the public except for:
   (1) the name of the victim; and
   (2) the terms of any written settlement agreement between the victim and the state.
    Subd. 7. Election to proceed in district court. (a) A victim may elect not to file a claim with
the panel or not to accept an offer of settlement from the panel. A victim who elects not to file a
claim with the panel or not to accept an offer of settlement has not waived any legal rights that may
be asserted against the state or a municipality or their employees and may proceed with a claim in
district court.
    (b) If a victim elects not to accept an offer of settlement, the state or a municipality or their
employees may not use any data provided by the victim to the panel in a subsequent legal proceeding.
The state or a municipality or their employees may obtain information, including data provided to
the panel, through discovery or other legal processes.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 2. EFFECT OF SPECIAL COMPENSATION PROCESS; RELATIONSHIP TO
OTHER LAW.
    Subdivision 1. No state liability or duty created. The establishment of the special compensation
process under section 1 and the emergency relief fund, and an offer of settlement or a settlement
agreement, is not an admission of liability by the state or a municipality or their employees and
does not establish a duty of the state, a municipality, or their employees to compensate victims.
The creation and funding of the compensation process under this act or an offer of settlement or
settlement agreement is not admissible in a judicial or administrative proceeding to establish liability
or a legal duty.
    Subd. 2. Payments as additional compensation. Payments made under section 1 or from the
emergency relief fund are intended to supplement and be in addition to any payments required to be
made by a third party under law or contract. Payments made under section 1 or from the emergency
relief fund are not a collateral source for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 62A.096 or 548.36
or other law providing for the reduction of a damage award or the amount of benefits recoverable

by a victim from a third party.
    Subd. 3. Payments from other sources. A person required to make payments, including future
payments, to a victim may not eliminate or reduce those payments as a result of compensation paid
to the victim under section 1 or from the emergency relief fund or as a result of the victim's release
of claims against the state, a municipality, or their employees under section 1. The obligation of any
person other than the state to make payments to a victim is primary as compared to any payment
made or to be made under section 1 or from the emergency relief fund. The persons referenced in
and covered by this subdivision and subdivision 4 include, without limitation:
   (1) reparation obligors, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 65B.43, subdivision 9, whether
they are insurers or self-insurers;
    (2) health plan companies, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 62Q.01, subdivision 4,
including the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association created under Minnesota Statutes,
section 62E.10;
   (3) insurance companies, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 60A.02, subdivision 4;
    (4) self-insured pools of political subdivisions organized under Minnesota Statutes, section
471.617 or 471.981, including service cooperatives pools organized under Minnesota Statutes,

   (5) risk retention groups, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 60E.02, subdivision 12;
   (6) joint self-insurance plans governed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter 60F;
    (7) workers' compensation insurers and private self-insurers, as defined in Minnesota Statutes,

Statutes, chapter 61B;

60C;
   (10) the Minnesota Joint Underwriting Association governed by Minnesota Statutes, chapter
62I;
    (11) all insurers providing credit life, credit accident and health, and credit involuntary
unemployment insurance under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 62B, but also including those
coverages written in connection with real estate mortgage loans and those provided to borrowers
at no additional cost;
   (12) the Minnesota unemployment insurance program provided under Minnesota Statutes,
chapter 268;
   (13) coverage offered by the state under medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and
MinnesotaCare; and
   (14) any other plan providing health, life, disability income, or long-term care coverage.
   Subd. 4. No third-party subrogation or recovery. (a) A person who has paid benefits or
88TH DAY]                          MONDAY, MARCH 10, 2008                                         7207

compensation to or on behalf of a victim does not have a subrogation or other right to recover those
benefits or compensation by making a claim, or recovering from payments made, under section 1
or from the emergency relief fund.
    (b) Following a settlement agreement under section 1, any person claiming a subrogation interest
against the amount to be paid by the state has 60 days in which to provide notice to the state and
the victim of its intent to assert its interest, during which time the commissioner of finance must not
make the payment. The subrogation claim is waived if the notice is not provided by the deadline.
If no notice is received by the deadline, the commissioner of finance shall make the payment. If
a notice of claim is received, the funds shall remain in escrow until resolution of the subrogation
issue. Any payment to a victim against which a subrogation claim is successfully asserted shall
immediately revert to the state, for further deliberation as to the manner in which to distribute the
payment to the victim.
    Subd. 5. Reimbursement of state; right of subrogation. (a) The state is entitled to recover from
any third party, including an agent, contractor, or vendor retained by the state, for payments made
from the emergency relief fund or under section 1 to the extent the third party caused or contributed
to the bridge collapse. The state may seek reimbursement from, or assert subrogation rights against,
a victim only to the extent that total payments received by the victim from the emergency relief
fund and under section 1 and from third parties for damages that relate to, involve, or arise out of
the bridge collapse, exceed the total damages incurred by the victim as determined by the panel
under section 1, subdivision 4.
    (b) The state is subrogated to all potential claims against third-party tortfeasors of a victim
receiving payment from the emergency relief fund or under section 1 to the extent the claims
relate to, involve, or arise out of the bridge collapse. The subrogation right of the state under this
subdivision is limited to the amount paid to the victim from the emergency relief fund and under
section 1. The rights of the state under this subdivision are in addition to other remedies, claims,
and rights relating to the bridge collapse that the state may have against other persons for the
recovery of money or to obtain other relief.
    Subd. 6. Amounts not considered for purposes of limit on government tort liability.
Payments made to victims under section 1 or from the emergency relief fund are not to be
considered in calculating the limit on tort claims in civil actions against the state arising out of the
bridge collapse for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 3.736, subdivision 4, clause (e), or a
municipality arising out of the bridge collapse for purposes of Minnesota Statutes, section 466.04,
subdivision 1, clause (5).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATIONS.
    (a) $25,000,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of finance to make
payments under settlement agreements entered into by the panel under section 1. This appropriation
is available until June 30, 2010. The legislature intends to fully fund the settlement agreements.
If it appears to the commissioner of finance that this appropriation may be insufficient to pay
all agreed upon settlement amounts, the commissioner shall promptly report to the chairs of the
senate Committee on Finance and the house of representatives Committee on Ways and Means
the estimated amount of the insufficiency and the estimated date when the appropriation will be
exhausted.
7208                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [88TH DAY

    (c) $680,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of finance for a grant
to Pillsbury United Communities in Minneapolis, to allow Waite House in Minneapolis to provide

bridge when the bridge collapsed. The commissioner must make $235,000 of this appropriation
available immediately, must make $215,000 available on August 1, 2008, and must make the
remainder of the appropriation available on August 1, 2009. The appropriation is available until
