The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher

and potentially dangerous dogs, as defined in section 347.50, from accompanying patrons to food

operator of the establishment or its agent has posted a sign banning dogs or otherwise informed the
person that dogs are not permitted in the establishment may be ordered to leave the premises.
    Subd. 4. Permit process. (a) The ordinance must require participating establishments to apply
for and receive a permit from the city before allowing patrons' dogs on their premises. The city shall
require from the applicant such information as the local government deems reasonably necessary,

pursuant to this section if the subsequent owner wishes to continue to accommodate patrons' dogs.
    (c) A city may incorporate the permit requirements of this section into a permit or license issued
under an existing ordinance if the city ensures that current and future permit and license holders
comply with the requirements of this section. A city may exempt current permit and license holders
from reapplying for a permit, if the current permit or license holder provides the city with the
information required in paragraph (a) and any other information that the city requests.
    Subd. 5. Minimum requirements. The ordinance must include such regulations and limitations
as the local government deems reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the public, but must require, at a minimum, the following requirements, which must be
clearly printed on a sign or signs posted on premises in a manner and place that are conspicuous
to employees and patrons:
   (1) employees must be prohibited from touching, petting, or otherwise handling dogs;
    (2) employees and patrons must not allow dogs to come into contact with serving dishes, utensils,
tableware, linens, paper products, or any other items involved in food service operations;

control;
   (4) dogs must not be allowed on chairs, tables, or other furnishings; and
   (5) dog waste must be cleaned immediately and the area sanitized.
    Subd. 6. Service animals. Nothing in this statute, or an ordinance adopted pursuant to this

     Sec. 12. [347.541] DISPOSITION OF SEIZED ANIMALS.
    Subdivision 1. Hearing. The owner of any dog declared dangerous has the right to a hearing by
an impartial hearing officer.
    Subd. 2. Security. A person claiming an interest in a seized dog may prevent disposition of
the dog by posting security in an amount sufficient to provide for the dog's actual cost of care and
keeping. The security must be posted within seven days of the seizure inclusive of the date of the
seizure.
    Subd. 3. Notice. The authority declaring the dog dangerous shall give notice of this section by
delivering or mailing it to the owner of the dog, or by posting a copy of it at the place where the
dog is kept, or by delivering it to a person residing on the property, and telephoning, if possible. The
notice must include:
    (1) a description of the seized dog; the authority for and purpose of the dangerous dog declaration
and seizure; the time, place, and circumstances under which the dog was declared dangerous; and
the telephone number and contact person where the dog is kept;
    (2) a statement that the owner of the dog may request a hearing concerning the dangerous dog
declaration and, if applicable, prior potentially dangerous dog declarations for the dog, and that
failure to do so within 14 days of the date of the notice will terminate the owner's right to a hearing
under this section;
   (3) a statement that if an appeal request is made within 14 days of the notice, the owner must
immediately comply with the requirements of section 347.52, paragraphs (a) and (c), and until such
time as the hearing officer issues an opinion;
   (4) a statement that if the hearing officer affirms the dangerous dog declaration, the owner will
have 14 days from receipt of that decision to comply with all other requirements of sections 347.51,
10062                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                              [114TH DAY

347.515, and 347.52;
   (5) a form to request a hearing under this subdivision; and
    (6) a statement that all actual costs of the care, keeping, and disposition of the dog are the
responsibility of the person claiming an interest in the dog, except to the extent that a court or
hearing officer finds that the seizure or impoundment was not substantially justified by law.
    Subd. 4. Right to hearing. Any hearing must be held within 14 days of the request to determine
the validity of the dangerous dog declaration. The hearing officer must be an impartial employee of
the local government or an impartial person retained by the local government to conduct the hearing.
In the event that the dangerous dog declaration is upheld by the hearing officer, actual expenses of
the hearing up to a maximum of $1,000 will be the responsibility of the dog's owner. The hearing
officer shall issue a decision on the matter within ten days after the hearing. The decision must be
delivered to the dog's owner by hand delivery or registered mail as soon as practical and a copy
must be provided to the animal control authority.
   Sec. 13. [347.542] RESTRICTIONS.
  Subdivision 1. Dog ownership prohibited. Except as provided in subdivision 3, no person may
own a dog if the person has:
   (1) been convicted of a third or subsequent violation of section 347.51, 347.515, or 347.52;
   (2) been convicted of a violation under section 609.205, clause (4);
   (3) been convicted of a gross misdemeanor under section 609.226, subdivision 1;
   (4) been convicted of a violation under section 609.226, subdivision 2; or
    (5) had a dog ordered destroyed under section 347.56 and been convicted of one or more
violations of section 347.51, 346.515, 347.52, or 609.226, subdivision 2.
   Subd. 2. Household members. If any member of a household is prohibited from owning a
dog in subdivision 1, unless specifically approved with or without restrictions by an animal control
authority, no person in the household is permitted to own a dog.
    Subd. 3. Dog ownership prohibition review. Beginning three years after a conviction under
subdivision 1 that prohibits a person from owning a dog, and annually thereafter, the person may
request that the animal control authority review the prohibition. The animal control authority may
consider such facts as the seriousness of the violation or violations that led to the prohibition,
any criminal convictions, or other facts that the animal control authority deems appropriate. The
animal control authority may rescind the prohibition entirely or rescind it with limitations. The
animal control authority also may establish conditions a person must meet before the prohibition
is rescinded, including, but not limited to, successfully completing dog training or dog handling
courses. If the animal control authority rescinds a person's prohibition and the person subsequently
fails to comply with any limitations imposed by the animal control authority or the person is
convicted of any animal violation involving unprovoked bites or dog attacks, the animal control
authority may permanently prohibit the person from owning a dog in this state.

                                                                                        May 12, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 651, a bill banning flame retardants and certain other
chemicals from products sold in Minnesota.
I am committed to supporting scientifically based processes to ensure that products manufactured
and sold in Minnesota provide appropriate protections to public health. However, I am vetoing this
bill because the prohibitions in the bill are not based on established science, and banning the use of
flame retardants in children's clothing may increase burn injuries to children.
This legislation bans decabromodiphenyl ethers (DECA), a proven fire retardant, effective July
1, 2011. Flame retardants are used in a variety of products including products designed to
protect children. Banning an effective flame retardant without assurances that safe and reasonable
alternatives are in place is unwise public policy.
Although a recent study completed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency identified potential
alternative flame retardants to DECA, the report did not conclude that a ban on DECA is sound
public policy. Moreover, contrary to claims from the legislative backers of this bill, the DECA ban
in this bill in not similar to action taken in Washington. That state has not initiated an outright ban
on products with DECA. Rather, a ban is implemented only after suitable alternatives are identified.

Such an approach would have been a wiser course here. I understand this approach was rejected by
the bill authors. Even more significantly, the European Union has conducted more than 500 studies
over 10 years and concluded that DECA does not pose any significant environmental or human
health risk.
The availability and safety of such alternatives is not well known. Further study of DECA and
the safety of alternatives to DECA should be conducted before a ban is implemented. This bill
recognized the need for further study. However, it implemented an outright ban of an effective flame
retardant before even considering the result of the research.
This bill also bans the sale of any children's products containing certain phthalates in a concentration
of more than 0.1 percent. Again, the legislative mandate overreaches and goes beyond current
scientific research. To my knowledge, no peer reviewed studies have concluded these products
pose a significant risk to human health. Indeed, Israel recently repealed its phthalates ban after
numerous studies showed that the science did not support the ban. While the European Union has a
ban, it recently completed its risk assessment studies and concluded: "The end products containing
diisonyl phthalate and the sources of exposure are unlikely to pose a risk for consumers following
inhalation, skin contact and ingestion."
The issues of product safety and product availability are important and need to be based on science.
I am willing to work with the Legislature that further studies and potentially limits or bans these
chemicals, but such steps should be based on sound science.
                                                      Sincerely,

the licensee and a Minnesota-licensed dentist who may limit the types of services authorized. At
the conclusion of the three-year period, the board shall grant an unlimited license without further

       Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.056, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Home equity limit for medical assistance payment of long-term care services. (a)
Effective for requests of medical assistance payment of long-term care services filed on or after July
1, 2006, and for renewals on or after July 1, 2006, for persons who received payment of long-term
care services under a request filed on or after January 1, 2006, the equity interest in the home of a
person whose eligibility for long-term care services is determined on or after January 1, 2006, shall
not exceed $500,000, unless it is the lawful residence of the person's spouse or child who is under
age 21, or a child of any age who is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in the
Supplemental Security Income program. The amount specified in this paragraph shall be increased
beginning in year 2011, from year to year based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price

Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average), rounded to the nearest $1,000.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a "home" means any real or personal property interest,
including an interest in an agricultural homestead as defined under section 273.124, subdivision
1, that, at the time of the request for medical assistance payment of long-term care services, is the
primary dwelling of the person or was the primary dwelling of the person before receipt of long-term
care services began outside of the home.
    (c) A person denied or terminated from medical assistance payment of long-term care services
because the person's home equity exceeds the home equity limit may seek a waiver based upon a
hardship by filing a written request with the county agency. Hardship is an imminent threat to the
person's health and well-being that is demonstrated by documentation of no alternatives for payment
of long-term care services. The county agency shall make a decision regarding the written request
to waive the home equity limit within 30 days if all necessary information has been provided. The
county agency shall send the person and the person's representative a written notice of decision on
the request for a demonstrated hardship waiver that also advises the person of appeal rights under
the fair hearing process of section 256.045.

annuity or other similar financial instrument or a change in the state's preferred remainder beneficiary
designation under the annuity or other similar financial instrument occurs. The county agency shall
provide the issuer with the name, address, and telephone number of a unit within the department
that the issuer can contact to comply with this paragraph.
    (d) "Preferred remainder beneficiary" for purposes of this subdivision and sections 256B.0594
and 256B.0595 means the state is a remainder beneficiary in the first position in an amount equal
to the amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the institutionalized person, or is a remainder
beneficiary in the second position if the institutionalized person designates and is survived by a
remainder beneficiary who is (1) a spouse who does not reside in a medical institution, (2) a minor
child, or (3) a child of any age who is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in the
Supplemental Security Income program. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the state is the remainder
beneficiary in the first position if the spouse or child disposes of the remainder for less than fair
market value.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "institutionalized person" and "long-term care services"
have the meanings given in section 256B.0595, subdivision 1, paragraph (h).
    (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "medical institution" means a skilled nursing facility,
intermediate care facility, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
nursing facility, or inpatient hospital.

The unprotected value of any protected asset is subject to estate recovery according to subdivisions
13 and 15.
    (d) The right to designate assets to be protected is personal to the individual and ends when
the individual dies, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions 13 and 15. It does not include the
increase in the value of the protected asset and the income, dividends, or profits from the asset. It
may be exercised by the individual or by anyone with the legal authority to do so on the individual's
behalf. It shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, or given away.
    (e) If the dollar amount of the benefits utilized under a partnership policy is greater than the
full fair market value of all assets protected at the time of the application for medical assistance
long-term care services, the individual may designate additional assets that become available during
the individual's lifetime for protection under this section. The individual must make the designation

spouse as a monthly income allowance for the community spouse. Beginning with the first full
calendar month the institutionalized spouse is in the institution, the monthly income allowance is
not considered available to the institutionalized spouse for monthly payment of costs of care in the
institution as long as the income is made available to the community spouse.
   (b) The monthly income allowance is the amount by which the community spouse's monthly
maintenance needs allowance under paragraphs (c) and (d) exceeds the amount of monthly income
otherwise available to the community spouse.
    (c) The community spouse's monthly maintenance needs allowance is the lesser of $1,500 or
122 percent of the monthly federal poverty guideline for a family of two plus an excess shelter
allowance. The excess shelter allowance is for the amount of shelter expenses that exceed 30 percent
of 122 percent of the federal poverty guideline line for a family of two. Shelter expenses are the
community spouse's expenses for rent, mortgage payments including principal and interest, taxes,
insurance, required maintenance charges for a cooperative or condominium that is the community
spouse's principal residence, and the standard utility allowance under section 5(e) of the federal Food
Stamp Act of 1977. If the community spouse has a required maintenance charge for a cooperative
or condominium, the standard utility allowance must be reduced by the amount of utility expenses
included in the required maintenance charge.
    If the community or institutionalized spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
income greater than the monthly maintenance needs allowance determined in this paragraph due to
exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, the monthly maintenance needs
allowance may be increased to an amount that provides needed additional income.
    (d) The percentage of the federal poverty guideline used to determine the monthly maintenance
needs allowance in paragraph (c) is increased to 133 percent on July 1, 1991, and to 150 percent
on July 1, 1992. Adjustments in the income limits due to annual changes in the federal poverty
guidelines shall be implemented the first day of July following publication of the annual changes.
The $1,500 maximum must be adjusted January 1, 1990, and every January 1 after that by the same
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States
city average) between the two previous Septembers.
   (e) If a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for monthly income for
support of the community spouse, the community spouse's monthly income allowance under this
subdivision shall not be less than the amount of the monthly income ordered.
    Subd. 3. Family allowance. (a) A family allowance determined under paragraph (b) is not
considered available to the institutionalized spouse for monthly payment of costs of care in the
institution.
   (b) The family allowance is equal to one-third of the amount by which 122 percent of the monthly
federal poverty guideline for a family of two exceeds the monthly income for that family member.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, the term family member only includes a minor or
dependent child as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, dependent parent, or dependent sibling
of the institutionalized or community spouse if the sibling resides with the community spouse.

   (d) The percentage of the federal poverty guideline used to determine the family allowance in
paragraph (b) is increased to 133 percent on July 1, 1991, and to 150 percent on July 1, 1992.
Adjustments in the income limits due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines shall be
implemented the first day of July following publication of the annual changes.
    Subd. 4. Treatment of income. (a) No income of the community spouse will be considered
available to an eligible institutionalized spouse, beginning the first full calendar month of
institutionalization, except as provided in this subdivision.
    (b) In determining the income of an institutionalized spouse or community spouse, after the
institutionalized spouse has been determined eligible for medical assistance, the following rules
apply.
   (1) For income that is not from a trust, availability is determined according to items (i) to (v),
unless the instrument providing the income otherwise specifically provides:
    (i) if payment is made solely in the name of one spouse, the income is considered available only
to that spouse;
   (ii) if payment is made in the names of both spouses, one-half of the income is considered
available to each;
   (iii) if payment is made in the names of one or both spouses together with one or more other
persons, the income is considered available to each spouse according to the spouse's interest, or
one-half of the joint interest is considered available to each spouse if each spouse's interest is not
specified;
   (iv) if there is no instrument that establishes ownership, one-half of the income is considered
available to each spouse; and
   (v) either spouse may rebut the determination of availability of income by showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that ownership interests are different than provided above.
    (2) For income from a trust, income is considered available to each spouse as provided in the
trust. If the trust does not specify an amount available to either or both spouses, availability will be
determined according to items (i) to (iii):
    (i) if payment of income is made only to one spouse, the income is considered available only to
that spouse;
   (ii) if payment of income is made to both spouses, one-half is considered available to each; and
   (iii) if payment is made to either or both spouses and one or more other persons, the income is
considered available to each spouse in proportion to each spouse's interest, or if no such interest is
specified, one-half of the joint interest is considered available to each spouse.

assistance, or within 30 months before or any time after the date of the first approved application
for medical assistance if the person has not yet been determined eligible for medical assistance, the

the improper distribution for the cost of medical assistance services provided or the amount of the
improper distribution, whichever is less.

   (A) an account or trust described in subsection (a), (c), or (p) of section 408 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
   (B) a simplified employee pension within the meaning of section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue

    Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0595, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Period of ineligibility. (a) For any uncompensated transfer occurring on or before
August 10, 1993, the number of months of ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the lesser
of 30 months, or the uncompensated transfer amount divided by the average medical assistance
rate for nursing facility services in the state in effect on the date of application. The amount used
to calculate the average medical assistance payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect
payment rates for the previous calendar year. The period of ineligibility begins with the month
in which the assets were transferred. If the transfer was not reported to the local agency at the
time of application, and the applicant received long-term care services during what would have
been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause of action exists against
the transferee for the cost of long-term care services provided during the period of ineligibility, or
for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. T                 ­h­­e­­­

uncompensated transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away,
sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received.
     (b) For uncompensated transfers made after August 10, 1993, the number of months of
ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the total uncompensated value of the resources
transferred divided by the average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state
in effect on the date of application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance
payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year.
The period of ineligibility begins with the first day of the month after the month in which the assets
were transferred except that if one or more uncompensated transfers are made during a period
of ineligibility, the total assets transferred during the ineligibility period shall be combined and
a penalty period calculated to begin on the first day of the month after the month in which the
first uncompensated transfer was made. If the transfer was reported to the local agency after the
date that advance notice of a period of ineligibility that affects the next month could be provided
to the recipient and the recipient received medical assistance services or the transfer was not
reported to the local agency, and the applicant or recipient received medical assistance services
during what would have been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause

fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of
compensation received. Effective for transfers made on or after March 1, 1996, involving persons
who apply for medical assistance on or after April 13, 1996, no cause of action exists for a transfer
unless:
    (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was a resident of a long-term care facility or was receiving that level of care in the community at
the time of the transfer;
   (2) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made to assist the
person to qualify for or retain medical assistance eligibility; or
    (3) the transferee actively solicited the transfer with intent to assist the person to qualify for or
retain eligibility for medical assistance.
    (c) For uncompensated transfers made on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility:

services shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fraction.
    (e) In the case of multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than one month for less than
fair market value on or after February 8, 2006, the period of ineligibility is calculated by treating
the total, cumulative, uncompensated value of all assets transferred during all months on or after
February 8, 2006, as one transfer.

became an institutionalized person, and who provided care to the individual that, as certified by
the individual's attending physician, permitted the individual to reside at home rather than receive
care in an institution or facility;
    (2) a satisfactory showing is made that the individual intended to dispose of the homestead at
fair market value or for other valuable consideration; or
    (3) the local agency grants a waiver of a penalty resulting from a transfer for less than fair
market value because denial of eligibility would cause undue hardship for the individual, based
on imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. Whenever an applicant or recipient is
denied eligibility because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the local agency shall notify the
applicant or recipient that the applicant or recipient may request a waiver of the penalty if the denial
of eligibility will cause undue hardship. With the written consent of the individual or the personal
representative of the individual, a long-term care facility in which an individual is residing may file
an undue hardship waiver request, on behalf of the individual who is denied eligibility for long-term
care services on or after July 1, 2006, due to a period of ineligibility resulting from a transfer on
or after February 8, 2006. In evaluating a waiver, the local agency shall take into account whether
the individual was the victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable
efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination
of hardship. If the local agency does not approve a hardship waiver, the local agency shall issue a
written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the
local agency's decision.
   (b) When a waiver is granted under paragraph (a), clause (3), a cause of action exists against the
person to whom the homestead was transferred for that portion of long-term care services ­   g­ ­­e

trust that is considered a transfer of assets under federal law;

    Subd. 4. Other exceptions to transfer prohibition. An institutionalized person who has made,
or whose spouse has made a transfer prohibited by subdivision 1, is not ineligible for long-term care
services if one of the following conditions applies:
   (1) the assets were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the
spouse; or
    (2) the institutionalized spouse, prior to being institutionalized, transferred assets to a spouse,
provided that the spouse to whom the assets were transferred does not then transfer those assets to
another person for less than fair market value. (At the time when one spouse is institutionalized,
assets must be allocated between the spouses as provided under section 256B.059); or
    (3) the assets were transferred to the individual's child who is blind or permanently and totally
disabled as determined in the supplemental security income program; or
    (4) a satisfactory showing is made that the individual intended to dispose of the assets either at
fair market value or for other valuable consideration; or
    (5) the local agency determines that denial of eligibility for long-term care services would
work an undue hardship and grants a waiver of a penalty resulting from a transfer for less than fair
market value based on an imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. Whenever an
applicant or recipient is denied eligibility because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the
local agency shall notify the applicant or recipient that the applicant or recipient may request a
waiver of the penalty if the denial of eligibility will cause undue hardship. With the written consent
of the individual or the personal representative of the individual, a long-term care facility in which
an individual is residing may file an undue hardship waiver request, on behalf of the individual
who is denied eligibility for long-term care services on or after July 1, 2006, due to a period of
ineligibility resulting from a transfer on or after February 8, 2006. In evaluating a waiver, the local
agency shall take into account whether the individual was the victim of financial exploitation,
whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource,
whether the individual has taken any action to prevent the designation of the department as a
remainder beneficiary on an annuity as described in section 256B.056, subdivision 11, and other
factors relevant to a determination of hardship. The local agency shall make a determination within
30 days of the receipt of all necessary information needed to make such a determination. If the
local agency does not approve a hardship waiver, the local agency shall issue a written notice to
the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the local agency's
decision. When a waiver is granted, a cause of action exists against the person to whom the assets
were transferred for that portion of long-term care services ­  g­ ­­e

portion of a trust that is considered a transfer of assets under federal law;
    (iii) 36 months of a transfer if transferred in any other manner after August 10, 1993, but prior
to February 8, 2006; or
    (iv) 60 months of any transfer made on or after February 8, 2006,

   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0595, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 8. Cause of action; transfer prior to death. (a) A cause of action exists against a
transferee who receives assets for less than fair market value, either:
    (1) from a person who was a recipient of medical assistance and who made an uncompensated
transfer that was known to the county agency but a penalty period could not be implemented under
this section due to the death of the person; or
    (2) from a person who was a recipient of medical assistance who made an uncompensated
transfer that was not known to the county agency and the transfer was made with the intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud the state or local agency from recovering as allowed under section 256B.15. In
determining intent under this clause consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:
    (i) the transfer was to a family member;
    (ii) the transferor retained possession or control of the property after the transfer;
    (iii) the transfer was concealed;
    (iv) the transfer included the majority of the transferor's assets;
    (v) the value of the consideration received was not reasonably equivalent to the fair market value
of the property; and
    (vi) the transfer occurred shortly before the death of the transferor.
    (b) No cause of action exists under this subdivision unless:
   (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was receiving medical assistance as described in section 256B.15, subdivision 1, paragraph (b); and
    (2) the transferee received the asset without providing a reasonable equivalent fair market value
in exchange for the transfer.
    (c) The cause of action is for the uncompensated amount of the transfer or the amount of medical
assistance paid on behalf of the person, whichever is less. The uncompensated transfer amount is
the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount
of the compensation received.

law to the contrary, a cause of action under subdivision 3, paragraph (b), or 4, clause (5), must be
commenced within six years of the date of approval of a waiver of the penalty period for a transfer
for less than fair market value based on undue hardship.

couple is survived by one of the following persons, a claim exists against the estate payable first from
the value of the nonhomestead property included in the estate and the personal representative shall
make, execute, and deliver to the county agency a lien against the homestead property in the estate
for any unpaid balance of the claim to the claimant as provided under this section:

     ­­) (2) a son or daughter or a grandchild who resided in the decedent medical assistance
recipient's home for at least two years immediately before the parent's or grandparent's
institutionalization and continuously since the date of institutionalization, and who establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence having provided care to the parent or grandparent who
received medical assistance, that the care was provided before institutionalization, and that the care
permitted the parent or grandparent to reside at home rather than in an institution.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "institutionalization" means receiving care:
    (1) in a nursing facility or swing bed, or intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities; or
    (2) through home and community-based services under section 256B.0915, 256B.092, or

       Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
      Subd. 3a. County authority. (a) The commissioner, when implementing the general assistance
medical care, or medical assistance prepayment program within a county, must include the county
board in the process of development, approval, and issuance of the request for proposals to provide
services to eligible individuals within the proposed county. County boards must be given reasonable
opportunity to make recommendations regarding the development, issuance, review of responses,
and changes needed in the request for proposals. The commissioner must provide county boards the
opportunity to review each proposal based on the identification of community needs under chapters
145A and 256E and county advocacy activities. If a county board finds that a proposal does not
address certain community needs, the county board and commissioner shall continue efforts for
improving the proposal and network prior to the approval of the contract. The county board shall
make recommendations regarding the approval of local networks and their operations to ensure
adequate availability and access to covered services. The provider or health plan must respond
directly to county advocates and the state prepaid medical assistance ombudsperson regarding
service delivery and must be accountable to the state regarding contracts with medical assistance
and general assistance medical care funds. The county board may recommend a maximum number
of participating health plans after considering the size of the enrolling population; ensuring
adequate access and capacity; considering the client and county administrative complexity; and
considering the need to promote the viability of locally developed health plans. The county board
or a single entity representing a group of county boards and the commissioner shall mutually select
health plans for participation at the time of initial implementation of the prepaid medical assistance
program in that county or group of counties and at the time of contract renewal. The commissioner
shall also seek input for contract requirements from the county or single entity representing a group
of county boards at each contract renewal and incorporate those recommendations into the contract
negotiation process. T                  ­h ­­e­­co­m ­m  ­ ­s i­­s­o

    (b) At the option of the county board, the board may develop contract requirements related to
the achievement of local public health goals to meet the health needs of medical assistance and
general assistance medical care enrollees. These requirements must be reasonably related to the
performance of health plan functions and within the scope of the medical assistance and general
assistance medical care benefit sets. If the county board and the commissioner mutually agree to such
requirements, the department shall include such requirements in all health plan contracts governing
the prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care programs in that county at initial
implementation of the program in that county and at the time of contract renewal. The county board
may participate in the enforcement of the contract provisions related to local public health goals.

    (c) For counties in which prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care
programs have not been established, the commissioner shall not implement those programs if
a county board submits acceptable and timely preliminary and final proposals under section
256B.692, until county-based purchasing is no longer operational in that county. For counties in
which prepaid medical assistance and general assistance medical care programs are in existence on
or after September 1, 1997, the commissioner must terminate contracts with health plans according
to section 256B.692, subdivision 5, if the county board submits and the commissioner accepts
preliminary and final proposals according to that subdivision. The commissioner is not required to
terminate contracts that begin on or after September 1, 1997, according to section 256B.692 until
two years have elapsed from the date of initial enrollment.
     (d) In the event that a county board or a single entity representing a group of county boards
and the commissioner cannot reach agreement regarding: (i) the selection of participating health
plans in that county; (ii) contract requirements; or (iii) implementation and enforcement of county
requirements including provisions regarding local public health goals, the commissioner shall
resolve all disputes after taking into account the recommendations of a three-person mediation
panel. The panel shall be composed of one designee of the president of the association of
Minnesota counties, one designee of the commissioner of human services, and one ­          d­e­

   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 28, is amended to read:
   Subd. 28. Medicare special needs plans; medical assistance basic health care. (a) The
commissioner may contract with qualified Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide
medical assistance basic health care services to persons with disabilities, including those with
developmental disabilities. Basic health care services include:
    (1) those services covered by the medical assistance state plan except for ICF/MR services,
home and community-based waiver services, case management for persons with developmental
disabilities under section 256B.0625, subdivision 20a, and personal care and certain home care
services defined by the commissioner in consultation with the stakeholder group established under
paragraph (d); and
    (2) basic health care services may also include risk for up to 100 days of nursing facility services
for persons who reside in a noninstitutional setting and home health services related to rehabilitation
as defined by the commissioner after consultation with the stakeholder group.
   The commissioner may exclude other medical assistance services from the basic health care
benefit set. Enrollees in these plans can access any excluded services on the same basis as other
medical assistance recipients who have not enrolled.
   Unless a person is otherwise required to enroll in managed care, enrollment in these plans for
Medicaid services must be voluntary. For purposes of this subdivision, automatic enrollment with
an option to opt out is not voluntary enrollment.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2007, the commissioner may contract with qualified Medicare special
needs plans to provide basic health care services under medical assistance to persons who are
dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and those Social Security beneficiaries eligible
for Medicaid but in the waiting period for Medicare. The commissioner shall consult with the
stakeholder group under paragraph (d) in developing program specifications for these services.
The commissioner shall report to the chairs of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction
over health and human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007, on implementation of
these programs and the need for increased funding for the ombudsman for managed care and other
consumer assistance and protections needed due to enrollment in managed care of persons with
disabilities. Payment for Medicaid services provided under this subdivision for the months of May
and June will be made no earlier than July 1 of the same calendar year.
    (c) Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner may expand contracting under this subdivision
to all persons with disabilities not otherwise required to enroll in managed care.
   (d) The commissioner shall establish a state-level stakeholder group to provide advice on
managed care programs for persons with disabilities, including both MnDHO and contracts with
special needs plans that provide basic health care services as described in paragraphs (a) and (b).
The stakeholder group shall provide advice on program expansions under this subdivision and
subdivision 23, including:
   (1) implementation efforts;
   (2) consumer protections; and
   (3) program specifications such as quality assurance measures, data collection and reporting,

and evaluation of costs, quality, and results.
    (e) Each plan under contract to provide medical assistance basic health care services shall
establish a local or regional stakeholder group, including representatives of the counties covered
by the plan, members, consumer advocates, and providers, for advice on issues that arise in the
local or regional area.
   (f) The commissioner is prohibited from providing the names of potential enrollees to health
plans for marketing purposes. The commissioner may mail marketing materials to potential enrollees
on behalf of health plans, in which case the health plans shall cover any costs incurred by the
commissioner for mailing marketing materials.
    Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.692, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
     Subd. 7. Dispute resolution. In the event the commissioner rejects a proposal under subdivision
6, the county board may request the recommendation of a three-person mediation panel. The
commissioner shall resolve all disputes after taking into account the recommendations of the
mediation panel. The panel shall be composed of one designee of the president of the Association
of Minnesota Counties, one designee of the commissioner of human services, and one ­       d­

    Subd. 3. General assistance medical care; eligibility. (a) General assistance medical care may
be paid for any person who is not eligible for medical assistance under chapter 256B, including
eligibility for medical assistance based on a spenddown of excess income according to section
256B.056, subdivision 5, or MinnesotaCare as defined in paragraph (b), except as provided in
paragraph (c), and:
    (1) who is receiving assistance under section 256D.05, except for families with children who
are eligible under Minnesota family investment program (MFIP), or who is having a payment made
on the person's behalf under sections 256I.01 to 256I.06; or
    (2) who is a resident of Minnesota; and
    (i) who has gross countable income not in excess of 75 percent of the federal poverty guidelines

Exempt assets, the reduction of excess assets, and the waiver of excess assets must conform to the
medical assistance program in section 256B.056, subdivision 3, with the following exception: the
maximum amount of undistributed funds in a trust that could be distributed to or on behalf of the

    (iii) the commissioner shall adjust the income standards under this section each July 1 by

    (b) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general
assistance medical care may not be paid for applicants or recipients who are adults with dependent
children under 21 whose gross family income is equal to or less than 275 percent of the federal

   (f) For applications received on or after October 1, 2003, eligibility may begin no earlier
than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),
a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is

a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (i) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (j) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
10108                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [114TH DAY

payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-803, is amended to read:

   (c) Nothing in this section affects or prevents:
   (1) any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of the estate;

    (3) the presentment and payment at any time within one year after the decedent's death of any
claim arising before the death of the decedent that is referred to in section 524.3-715, clause (18),
although the same may be otherwise barred under this section; or
   (4) the presentment and payment at any time before a petition is filed in compliance with section
524.3-1001 or 524.3-1002 or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, of:
   (i) any claim arising after the death of the decedent that is referred to in section 524.3-715, clause
(18), although the same may be otherwise barred hereunder;
    (ii) any other claim, including claims subject to clause (3), which would otherwise be barred
hereunder, upon allowance by the court upon petition of the personal representative or the claimant
for cause shown on notice and hearing as the court may direct.
   Sec. 42. NURSING FACILITY PENSION COSTS.
    The commissioner of human services shall evaluate the extent to which the alternative payment
system reimbursement methodology for pension costs leads to funding shortfalls for nursing
facilities that convert from public to private ownership. The commissioner shall report to the

system reimbursement methodology for pension costs necessary to ensure the financial viability
of nursing facilities. The commissioner shall pay for any costs related to this study using existing
resources.

    Sec. 3. [246B.06] ESTABLISHMENT OF MINNESOTA STATE INDUSTRIES.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; purpose. (a) The commissioner of human services may
establish, equip, maintain, and operate the Minnesota State Industries at any Minnesota sex
offender program facility under this chapter. The commissioner may establish industrial and
commercial activities for sex offender treatment patients as the commissioner deems necessary and
suitable to the profitable employment, educational training, and development of proper work habits
of patients consistent with the requirements in section 246B.05. The industrial and commercial
activities authorized by this section are designated Minnesota State Industries and must be for the
primary purpose of sustaining and ensuring Minnesota State Industries' self-sufficiency, providing
educational training, meaningful employment, and the teaching of proper work habits to the
patients of the Minnesota sex offender program under this chapter, and not solely as competitive
business ventures.
    (b) The net profits from Minnesota State Industries must be used for the benefit of the
patients as it relates to building education and self-sufficiency skills. Prior to the establishment
of any industrial and commercial activity, the commissioner of human services shall consult with
stakeholders including representatives of business, industry, organized labor, the commissioner
of education, the state Apprenticeship Council, the commissioner of labor and industry, the
commissioner of employment and economic development, the commissioner of administration, and
other stakeholders the commissioner deems qualified. The purpose of the stakeholder consultation
is to determine the quantity and nature of the goods, wares, merchandise, and services to be made
or provided, and the types of processes to be used in their manufacture, processing, repair, and
production consistent with the greatest opportunity for the reform and educational training of the
patients, and with the best interests of the state, business, industry, and labor.
    (c) The commissioner of human services shall, at all times in the conduct of any industrial or
commercial activity authorized by this section, utilize patient labor to the greatest extent feasible,
provided that the commissioner may employ all administrative, supervisory, and other skilled
workers necessary to the proper instruction of the patients and the profitable and efficient operation
of the industrial and commercial activities authorized by this section.
    (d) The commissioner of human services may authorize the director of any Minnesota sex
offender treatment facility under the commissioner's control to accept work projects from outside
sources for processing, fabrication, or repair, provided that preference is given to the performance
of work projects for state departments and agencies.
    Subd. 2. Revolving fund. As described in section 246B.05, subdivision 2, there is established
a Minnesota State Industries revolving fund under the control of the commissioner of human
services. The revolving fund must be used for Minnesota State Industries authorized under this
section, including, but not limited to, the purchase of equipment and raw materials, the payment
of salaries and wages, and other necessary expenses as determined by the commissioner of
10112                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [114TH DAY

human services. The purchase of services, materials, and commodities used in and held for resale
are not subject to the competitive bidding procedures of section 16C.06, but are subject to all
other provisions of chapters 16B and 16C. When practical, purchases must be made from small
targeted group businesses designated under section 16C.16. Additionally, the expenses of patient
educational training and self-sufficiency skills may be financed from the revolving fund in an
amount to be determined by the commissioner or designee. The proceeds and income from all
Minnesota State Industries conducted at the Minnesota sex offender treatment facilities must be
deposited in the revolving fund subject to disbursement under subdivision 3. The commissioner
of human services may request that money in the fund be invested pursuant to section 11A.25.
Proceeds from the investment not currently needed must be accounted for separately and credited
to the revolving fund.
    Subd. 3. Disbursement from fund. The Minnesota State Industries revolving fund must be
deposited in the state treasury and paid out only on proper vouchers as authorized and approved by
the commissioner of human services, and in the same manner and under the same restrictions as are
now provided by law for the disbursement of funds by the commissioner. An amount deposited in
the state treasury equal to six months of net operating cash as determined by the prior 12 months
of revenue and cash flow statements must be restricted for use only by Minnesota State Industries
as described under subdivision 2. For purposes of this subdivision, "net operating cash" means net
income, minus sales, plus cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold include all direct costs of industry
products attributable to the goods' production.
    Subd. 4. Revolving fund; borrowing. The commissioner of human services is authorized
to borrow sums of money as the commissioner deems necessary to meet current demands on
the Minnesota State Industries revolving fund. The sums borrowed must not exceed, in any
calendar year, six months of net operating cash as determined by the previous 12 months of the
industries' revenue and cash flow statements. If the commissioner of human services determines
that borrowing of funds is necessary, the commissioner of human services shall certify this need
to the commissioner of finance. Funds may be borrowed from general fund appropriations to the
Minnesota sex offender program with the authorization of the commissioner of finance. Upon
authorization of the commissioner of finance, the transfer must be made and credited to the
Minnesota State Industries revolving fund. The sum transferred to the Minnesota State Industries
revolving fund must be repaid by the commissioner of human services from the revolving fund
to the fund from which it was transferred in a time period specified by the commissioner of
finance, but by no later than the end of the biennium, as defined in section 16A.011, in which the
loan is made. When any transfer is made to the Minnesota State Industries revolving fund, the
commissioner of finance shall notify the commissioner of human services of the amount transferred
to the fund and the date the transfer is to be repaid.
    Subd. 5. Federal grant fund transfers. Grants received by the commissioner of human
services from the federal government for any vocational training program or for administration by
the commissioner of human services must (1) be credited to a federal grant fund and then (2) be
transferred from the federal grant fund to the credit of the commissioner of human services in the
appropriate account upon certification by the commissioner of human services that the amounts
requested to be transferred have been earned or are required for the purposes of this section. Funds
received by the federal grant fund need not be budgeted as such, provided transfers from the fund
are budgeted for allotment purposes in the appropriate appropriation.
114TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 12, 2008                                         10113

    Subd. 6. Wages. Notwithstanding section 177.24 or any other law to the contrary, wages paid to
patients working within this program are at the discretion of the commissioner of human services.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Restriction. Except when ordered by the court pursuant to a finding of necessity
to protect the life of the proposed patient or others, or as provided under subdivision 1a, no person
subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be confined in a jail or correctional institution, except
pursuant to chapter 242 or 244.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Exception. A person who is being petitioned for commitment under section 253B.185
and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision 2b or 7, may be
confined at a Department of Corrections or a county correctional or detention facility, rather than
a secure treatment facility, until a determination of the commitment petition as specified in this
subdivision.
   (a) A court may order that a person who is being petitioned for commitment under section
253B.185 be confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to the judicial hold order
under the following circumstances and conditions:
    (1) The person is currently serving a sentence in a Department of Corrections facility and the
court determines that the person has made a knowing and voluntary (i) waiver of the right to be held
in a secure treatment facility and (ii) election to be held in a Department of Corrections facility. The
order confining the person in the Department of Corrections facility shall remain in effect until the
court vacates the order or the person's criminal sentence and conditional release term expire.
   In no case may the person be held in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant only to this
subdivision, and not pursuant to any separate correctional authority, for more than 210 days.
    (2) A person who has elected to be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this
subdivision may revoke the election by filing a written notice of intent to revoke the election with the
court and serving the notice upon the Department of Corrections and the county attorney. The court
shall order the person transferred to a secure treatment facility within 15 days of the date that the
notice of revocation was filed with the court, except that, if the person has additional time to serve
in prison at the end of the 15-day period, the person shall not be transferred to a secure treatment
facility until the person's prison term expires. After a person has revoked an election to remain in a
Department of Corrections facility under this subdivision, the court may not adopt another election
to remain in a Department of Corrections facility without the agreement of both parties and the
Department of Corrections.
    (3) Upon petition by the commissioner of corrections, after notice to the parties and opportunity
for hearing and for good cause shown, the court may order that the person's place of confinement
be changed from the Department of Corrections to a secure treatment facility.
    (4) While at a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this subdivision, the person shall
remain subject to all rules and practices applicable to correctional inmates in the facility in which
the person is placed including, but not limited to, the powers and duties of the commissioner of
10114                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [114TH DAY

corrections under section 241.01, powers relating to use of force under section 243.52, and the right
of the commissioner of corrections to determine the place of confinement in a prison, reformatory,
or other facility.
    (5) A person may not be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this provision
beyond the end of the person's executed sentence or the end of any applicable conditional release
period, whichever is later. If a person confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to
this provision reaches the person's supervised release date and is subject to a period of conditional
release, the period of conditional release shall commence on the supervised release date even though
the person remains in the Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this provision. At the end
of the later of the executed sentence or any applicable conditional release period, the person shall
be transferred to a secure treatment facility.
    (6) Nothing in this section may be construed to establish a right of an inmate in a state
correctional facility to participate in sex offender treatment. This section must be construed in a
manner consistent with the provisions of section 244.03.
    (b) The committing county may offer a person who is being petitioned for commitment under
section 253B.185 and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision
2b or 7, the option to be held in a county correctional or detention facility rather than a secure
treatment facility, under such terms as may be agreed to by the county, the commitment petitioner,
and the commitment respondent. If a person makes such an election under this paragraph, the
court hold order shall specify the terms of the agreement, including the conditions for revoking
the election.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Facilities. Each county or a group of counties shall maintain or provide by contract
a facility for confinement of persons held temporarily for observation, evaluation, diagnosis,
treatment, and care. When the temporary confinement is provided at a regional treatment center,
the commissioner shall charge the county of financial responsibility for the costs of confinement of
persons hospitalized under section 253B.05, subdivisions 1 and 2, and section 253B.07, subdivision
2b, except that the commissioner shall bill the responsible health plan first. If the person has
health plan coverage, but the hospitalization does not meet the criteria in subdivision 6 or section
62M.07, 62Q.53, or 62Q.535, the county is responsible. When a person is temporarily confined in
a Department of Corrections facility solely under subdivision 1a, and not based on any separate
correctional authority:
   (1) the commissioner of corrections may charge the county of financial responsibility for the
costs of confinement; and
   (2) the Department of Human Services shall use existing appropriations to fund all remaining
nonconfinement costs. The funds received by the commissioner for the confinement and
nonconfinement costs are appropriated to the department for these purposes.
"County of financial responsibility" means the county in which the person resides at the time
of confinement or, if the person has no residence in this state, the county which initiated the
confinement. The charge for confinement in a facility operated by the commissioner of human

services shall be based on the commissioner's determination of the cost of care pursuant to section
246.50, subdivision 5. When there is a dispute as to which county is the county of financial
responsibility, the county charged for the costs of confinement shall pay for them pending final
determination of the dispute over financial responsibility. Disputes about the county of financial
responsibility shall be submitted to the commissioner to be settled in the manner prescribed in
section 256G.09.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.18, subdivision 4c, is amended to read:

section 253B.185 from a treatment facility, the head of the treatment facility shall make a reasonable
effort to notify any victim of a crime for which the person was convicted that the person may
be discharged or released and that the victim has a right to submit a written statement regarding
decisions of the medical director, special review board, or commissioner with respect to the person.
To the extent possible, the notice must be provided at least 14 days before any special review board
hearing or before a determination on a pass plan. Notwithstanding section 611A.06, subdivision 4,
the commissioner shall provide the judicial appeal panel with victim information in order to comply

with the provisions of this section. The judicial appeal panel shall ensure that the data on victims
remains private as provided for in section 611A.06, subdivision 4.
    (d) This subdivision applies only to victims who have requested notification by contacting, in
writing, the county attorney in the county where the conviction for the crime occurred. A county
attorney who receives a request for notification under this paragraph shall promptly forward the
request to the commissioner of human services.
    (e) The rights under this subdivision are in addition to rights available to a victim under chapter
611A. This provision does not give a victim all the rights of a "notified person" or a person "entitled
to statutory notice" under subdivision 4a, 4b, or 5.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 253B.185, subdivision 1b, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 1b. County attorney access to data. Notwithstanding sections 144.291 to 144.298;
245.467, subdivision 6; 245.4876, subdivision 7; 260B.171; 260B.235, subdivision 8; 260C.171;
and 609.749, subdivision 6, or any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, prior to filing a
petition for commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person,
and upon notice to the proposed patient, the county attorney or the county attorney's designee may
move the court for an order granting access to any records or data, to the extent it relates to the
proposed patient, for the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if
a petition is filed, to support the allegations set forth in the petition.
    The court may grant the motion if: (1) the Department of Corrections refers the case for
commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or a sexually dangerous person; or (2) upon a
showing that the requested category of data or records may be relevant to the determination by the
county attorney or designee. The court shall decide a motion under this subdivision within 48 hours
after a hearing on the motion. Notice to the proposed patient need not be given upon a showing
that such notice may result in harm or harassment of interested persons or potential witnesses.
    Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, a county attorney considering the
civil commitment of a person under this section may obtain records and data from the Department
of Corrections or any probation or parole agency in this state upon request, without a court order, for
the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if a petition is filed, to
support the allegations set forth in the petition. At the time of the request for the records, the county
attorney shall provide notice of the request to the person who is the subject of the records.
   Data collected pursuant to this subdivision shall retain their original status and, if not public, are
inadmissible in any court proceeding unrelated to civil commitment, unless otherwise permitted.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Financial responsibility. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state facility" has the
meaning given in section 246.50 and also includes a Department of Corrections facility when the
proposed patient is confined in such a facility pursuant to section 253B.045, subdivision 1a.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 246.54, 253B.045, and any other law to the contrary, when a
petition is filed for commitment under this section pursuant to the notice required in section 244.05,
10118                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [114TH DAY

subdivision 7, the state and county are each responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the person's
confinement at a state facility or county jail, prior to commitment.
    (c) The county shall submit an invoice to the state court administrator for reimbursement of the
state's share of the cost of confinement.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the state's responsibility for reimbursement is limited to the
amount appropriated for this purpose.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Petition for reduction in custody. (a) This subdivision applies only to committed
persons as defined in paragraph (b). The procedures in section 253B.18, subdivision 5a, for victim
notification and right to submit a statement under section 253B.18 apply to petitions filed and
reductions in custody recommended under this subdivision.
   (b) As used in this subdivision:
   (1) "committed person" means an individual committed under this section, or under this section
and under section 253B.18, as mentally ill and dangerous. It does not include persons committed
only as mentally ill and dangerous under section 253B.18; and
    (2) "reduction in custody" means transfer out of a secure treatment facility, a provisional
discharge, or a discharge from commitment. A reduction in custody is considered to be a
commitment proceeding under section 8.01.
    (c) A petition for a reduction in custody or an appeal of a revocation of provisional discharge
may be filed by either the committed person or by the head of the treatment facility and must be filed
with and considered by the special review board. A committed person may not petition the special
review board any sooner than six months following either:
    (1) the entry of judgment in the district court of the order for commitment issued under section
253B.18, subdivision 3, or upon the exhaustion of all related appeal rights in state court relating to
that order, whichever is later; or
    (2) any recommendation of the special review board or order of the judicial appeal panel, or
upon the exhaustion of all appeal rights in state court, whichever is later. The medical director may
petition at any time. The special review board proceedings are not contested cases as defined in
chapter 14.
    (d) The special review board shall hold a hearing on each petition before issuing a
recommendation under paragraph (f). Fourteen days before the hearing, the committing court,
the county attorney of the county of commitment, the designated agency, an interested person,
the petitioner and the petitioner's counsel, and the committed person and the committed person's
counsel must be given written notice by the commissioner of the time and place of the hearing
before the special review board. Only those entitled to statutory notice of the hearing or those
administratively required to attend may be present at the hearing. The patient may designate
interested persons to receive notice by providing the names and addresses to the commissioner at
least 21 days before the hearing.

    (e) A person or agency receiving notice that submits documentary evidence to the special
review board before the hearing must also provide copies to the committed person, the committed
person's counsel, the county attorney of the county of commitment, the case manager, and the
commissioner. The special review board must consider any statements received from victims under
section 253B.18, subdivision 5a.
    (f) Within 30 days of the hearing, the special review board shall issue written findings of fact
and shall recommend denial or approval of the petition to the judicial appeal panel established under
section 253B.19. The commissioner shall forward the recommendation of the special review board
to the judicial appeal panel and to every person entitled to statutory notice. No reduction in custody
or reversal of a revocation of provisional discharge recommended by the special review board is
effective until it has been reviewed by the judicial appeal panel and until 15 days after an order
from the judicial appeal panel affirming, modifying, or denying the recommendation.

mentally ill and dangerous to the public under section 253B.18, or the county attorney of the county
from which the person was committed or the county of financial responsibility, may petition the
judicial appeal panel for a rehearing and reconsideration of a decision by the commissioner under
section 253B.18, subdivision 5. The judicial appeal panel must not consider petitions for relief other
than those considered by the commissioner from which the appeal is taken. The petition must be
filed with the Supreme Court within 30 days after the decision of the commissioner is signed. The
hearing must be held within 45 days of the filing of the petition unless an extension is granted for
good cause.
    (b) A person committed as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person
under section 253B.185, or committed as both mentally ill and dangerous to the public under section
253B.18 and as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person under section
253B.185; the county attorney of the county from which the person was committed or the county of
financial responsibility; or the commissioner may petition the judicial appeal panel for a rehearing
and reconsideration of a decision of the special review board under section 253B.185, subdivision
9. The petition must be filed with the Supreme Court within 30 days after the decision is mailed by
the commissioner as required in section 253B.185, subdivision 9, paragraph (f). The hearing must
be held within 180 days of the filing of the petition unless an extension is granted for good cause.
If no party petitions the judicial appeal panel for a rehearing or reconsideration within 30 days, the
judicial appeal panel shall either issue an order adopting the recommendations of the special review
board or set the matter on for a hearing pursuant to this paragraph.
    (c) For an appeal under paragraph (a) or (b), the Supreme Court shall refer the petition to the
chief judge of the judicial appeal panel. The chief judge shall notify the patient, the county attorney
of the county of commitment, the designated agency, the commissioner, the head of the treatment
facility, any interested person, and other persons the chief judge designates, of the time and place of
the hearing on the petition. The notice shall be given at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing.

    (d) In order to receive a grant, community health boards and tribal governments must submit a
health improvement plan to the commissioner of health for approval. The commissioner may require

monitored.
    Subd. 4. Technical assistance and oversight. The commissioner shall provide content expertise,
technical expertise, and training to grant recipients and advice on evidence-based strategies,
including those based on populations and types of communities served. The commissioner shall

recommendations on a sustainable funding source for the statewide health improvement program
other than the health care access fund.
    Subd. 7. Supplantation of existing funds. Community health boards and tribal governments
must use funds received under this section to develop new programs, expand current programs that
work to reduce the percentage of Minnesotans who are obese or overweight, or who use tobacco, or
replace discontinued state or federal funds previously used to reduce the percentage of Minnesotans
who are obese or overweight, or who use tobacco. Funds must not be used to supplant current state
or local funding to community health boards or tribal governments used to reduce the percentage of
Minnesotans who are obese or overweight or to reduce tobacco use.

exempt from the provisions of chapter 14, including the specific provisions in section 14.386.
    Subd. 3. Requirements for clinicians certified as health care homes. (a) A personal clinician
or a primary care clinic may be certified as a health care home. If a primary care clinic is certified,
all of the primary care clinics' clinicians must meet the criteria of a health care home. In order to be
certified as a health care home, a clinician or clinic must meet the standards set by the commissioners
in accordance with this section. Certification as a health care home is voluntary. In order to maintain
their status as health care homes, clinicians or clinics must renew their certification annually.
    (b) Clinicians or clinics certified as health care homes must offer their health care home services
to all their patients with complex or chronic health conditions who are interested in participation.
   (c) Health care homes must participate in the health care home learning collaborative established
under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 4. Alternative models. Nothing in this section shall preclude the continued development

Medicaid programs under section 256B.69, subdivisions 23 and 28, are enrolled in managed care
long-term care programs under section 256B.69, subdivision 6, paragraph (b), are dually eligible
for Medicare and medical assistance, are in the waiting period for Medicare, or who have other
primary coverage.
    Subd. 5. Health care home collaborative. By July 1, 2009, the commissioners shall establish a
health care home collaborative to provide an opportunity for health care homes and state agencies
to exchange information related to quality improvement and best practices.
    Subd. 6. Evaluation and continued development. (a) For continued certification under this
section, health care homes must meet process, outcome, and quality standards as developed and
specified by the commissioners. The commissioners shall collect data from health care homes
necessary for monitoring compliance with certification standards and for evaluating the impact of
health care homes on health care quality, cost, and outcomes.
    (b) The commissioners may contract with a private entity to perform an evaluation of the
effectiveness of health care homes. Data collected under this subdivision is classified as nonpublic
data under chapter 13.
    Subd. 7. Outreach. Upon implementation of the certification process and standards under
subdivision 1, the commissioner shall encourage state health care program enrollees who have a
complex or chronic condition to select a primary care clinic with clinicians who have been certified
as health care homes.
   Sec. 2. [256B.0752] CARE COORDINATION FEE.
    Subdivision 1. Development. The commissioner of human services shall develop a payment
system that provides per-person care coordination payments to health care providers for providing
care coordination services and directly managing onsite or employing care coordinators. In order
to be eligible for a care coordination payment, a health care provider must be certified as a health
care home by the commissioners of human services and health based on the certification standards
for health care homes established under section 256B.0751. The care coordination payment system
must vary the fees paid by thresholds of care complexity, with the highest fees being paid for
care provided to individuals requiring the most intensive care coordination and those who face
racial, ethnic, or language barriers. The commissioner may determine a schedule for phasing-in
care coordination fees such that the fees will be applied first to individuals who have, or are at
risk of developing, complex or chronic health conditions and coordinate with the implementation
of the provider-directed care coordination payments under section 256B.0625, subdivision 51.
Development of the payment system must be completed by January 1, 2010.
    Subd. 2. Payment of care coordination fee. By July 1, 2010, the commissioner of human
services shall pay each certified health care home a per-person care coordination fee for
providing care coordination services for each state health care program enrollee served under the
fee-for-service system. The care coordination fee must be determined by the commissioner in
contracts with certified health care homes. Payment of the care coordination fee is contingent on
the health care home meeting the certification standards for health care homes described in section
256B.0751. The care coordination fee is in addition to reimbursement received by a health care
home under the medical assistance fee-for-service payment system for health care services.
   Subd. 3. Managed care and county-based purchasing. By July 1, 2010, the commissioner

of human services shall require managed care and county-based purchasing plans serving state
health care program enrollees under sections 256B.69 and 256B.692, and chapters 256D and 256L
to implement a care coordination payment system for state health care program enrollees who are
provided care coordination services in health care homes certified under section 256B.0751. The
payment system shall be designed in accordance with section 62U.05.
    Subd. 4. Cost neutrality. If initial savings from implementation of health care homes are
not sufficient to allow implementation of the care coordination fee in a cost-neutral manner, the
commissioner may make recommendations to the legislature on reallocating costs within the health
care system.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval, whichever
is later.
   Sec. 3. [256B.0753] HEALTH CARE HOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Standards and criteria review. Prior to implementation, the commissioners
shall report the certification standards and evaluation criteria established in sections 256B.0751 and
256B.0752 to the Legislative Commission on Health Care Access. These standards are not subject
to chapter 14, and the specific provisions in section 14.386 do not apply.
    Subd. 2. Annual reports on implementation and administration. The commissioners shall
report annually to the legislature on the implementation and administration of the health care home
model for state health care program enrollees in the fee-for-service, managed care, and county-based
purchasing sectors, beginning January 15, 2011, and each January 15 thereafter. The annual report
must include the cost benefit analysis of the implementation of the health care home model for the
state public health care programs.
   Subd. 3. Evaluation reports. The commissioners shall provide to the legislature comprehensive
evaluations of the health care home model three years and five years after implementation. The
report must include:
   (1) the number of state health care program enrollees in health care homes, the number and
characteristics of enrollees with complex or chronic conditions, identified by income, race, ethnicity,
and language;
   (2) the number and geographic distribution of health care home providers;
   (3) the performance and quality of care of health care homes;
   (4) measures of preventive care;
    (5) health care home payment arrangements, and costs related to implementation and payment
of care coordination fees; and
   (6) the estimated impact of health care homes on health disparities.
  Sec. 4. [256B.766] PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT RATE
INCREASE.
   (a) Effective for physician services rendered on or after January 1, 2009, the commissioner
shall increase reimbursements to primary care physicians deemed by the commissioner to meet the
114TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 12, 2008                                        10133

requirements in paragraph (b). Reimbursement may be increased by not more than 50 percent above
the reimbursement rate that would otherwise be paid to the primary care provider. Payments to health
plan companies shall be adjusted to reflect increased reimbursement to primary care physicians as
approved by the commissioner.
    (b) The commissioner, in collaboration with the Office of Rural Health, shall determine areas
of the state in need of primary care physicians. By September 1 of each year, beginning September
1, 2008, the commissioner shall accept applications from primary care physicians who agree to
practice in a designated underserved area for a period of no less than five years. The commissioner
shall determine participant eligibility based on their suitability for practice serving a designated
geographic area.
    (c) The commissioner may reconsider the designated areas, as necessary. A primary care
physician who agrees to practice in an area designated as underserved shall receive the increased
reimbursement rates for at least a period of five years, unless the physician discontinues practicing
in the designated area during the five-year period.
    (d) A health care clinic or medical group may submit applications under this section for primary
care physicians who will be hired to fill vacancies, prior to filling the vacant position.
   Sec. 5. WORKFORCE SHORTAGE STUDY.
    To address health care workforce shortages, the commissioner of health, in consultation with
the health licensing boards and professional associations, shall study changes necessary in health
professional licensure and regulation to ensure full utilization of advanced practice registered nurses,
physician assistants, and other licensed health care professionals in the health care home and primary
delivery system. The commissioner shall make recommendations to the legislature by January 15,
2009.

programs and social service programs including, but not limited to WIC, free and reduced school
lunch programs, and food stamps, and shall develop and use automated systems to identify persons
served by social service programs who may be eligible for, but are not enrolled in, a state health care
program. By January 15, 2009, the commissioner shall, as necessary, identify and recommend to the
legislature statutory changes to state health care and social service programs necessary to improve
coordination and automation of outreach and enrollment efforts.
    (c) By January 15, 2009, the commissioner shall establish and implement an automated process

    Subd. 3a. Renewal of eligibility. (a) Beginning July 1, 2007, an enrollee's eligibility must be
renewed every 12 months. The 12-month period begins in the month after the month the application
is approved.
   (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The premium for the new period of eligibility must be received as
provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
    (c) For single adults and households with no children formerly enrolled in general assistance
medical care and enrolled in MinnesotaCare according to section 256D.03, subdivision 3, the first

assistance medical care.
    (d) An enrollee who fails to submit renewal forms and related documentation necessary for

standard and meets all other eligibility requirements, including compliance at the time of
application with citizenship or nationality documentation requirements under section 256L.04,
subdivision 10, must be determined eligible and enrolled upon payment of premiums according
to subdivision 3. The applicant shall provide all required verifications within 60 days' notice of
the eligibility determination, or eligibility shall be denied or canceled. Applicants who are denied
or canceled for failure to provide all required verifications are not eligible for coverage using the
delayed verification procedures specified in this subdivision for 12 months.

     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.06, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Commissioner's duties and payment. (a) Premiums are dedicated to the commissioner
for MinnesotaCare.
    (b) The commissioner shall develop and implement procedures to: (1) require enrollees to report
changes in income; (2) adjust sliding scale premium payments, based upon both increases and
decreases in enrollee income, at the time the change in income is reported; and (3) disenroll enrollees
from MinnesotaCare for failure to pay required premiums. Failure to pay includes payment with
a dishonored check, a returned automatic bank withdrawal, or a refused credit card or debit card
payment. The commissioner may demand a guaranteed form of payment, including a cashier's check
or a money order, as the only means to replace a dishonored, returned, or refused payment.
    (c) Premiums are calculated on a calendar month basis and may be paid on a monthly, quarterly,
or semiannual basis, with the first payment due upon notice from the commissioner of the premium
amount required. The commissioner shall inform applicants and enrollees of these premium payment
options. Premium payment is required before enrollment is complete and to maintain eligibility
in MinnesotaCare. Premium payments received before noon are credited the same day. Premium
payments received after noon are credited on the next working day.
      (d) Nonpayment of the premium will result in disenrollment from the plan effective ­                                   fo­­r the
first day of the calendar month following the calendar month for which the premium was due.
Persons disenrolled for nonpayment or who voluntarily terminate coverage from the program may
not reenroll until four calendar months have elapsed. P                ­­

to persons disenrolled for nonpayment who reapply under section 256L.05, subdivision 3b. Persons
disenrolled for nonpayment or who voluntarily terminate coverage from the program may not
reenroll for four calendar months unless the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment.
Good cause does not exist if a person chooses to pay other family expenses instead of the premium.
The commissioner shall define good cause in rule.

5, section 45, who have family gross incomes that are equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines, must meet the requirements of subdivision 2 to be eligible for MinnesotaCare.
    Families enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 1, whose income
increases above 2­­
                  75
                   ­ 300 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, are no longer eligible for the
program and shall be disenrolled by the commissioner. Beginning January 1, 2008, individuals
enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 7, whose income increases above
200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or 215 percent of the federal poverty guidelines on
or after July 1, 2009, or 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines on or after July 1, 2010, are
no longer eligible for the program and shall be disenrolled by the commissioner. For persons
disenrolled under this subdivision, MinnesotaCare coverage terminates the last day of the calendar
month following the month in which the commissioner determines that the income of a family or
individual exceeds program income limits.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), children may remain enrolled in MinnesotaCare if ten percent
of their gross individual or gross family income as defined in section 256L.01, subdivision 4, is
less than the annual premium for a policy with a $500 deductible available through the Minnesota
Comprehensive Health Association. Children who are no longer eligible for MinnesotaCare under
this clause shall be given a 12-month notice period from the date that ineligibility is determined
before disenrollment. The premium for children remaining eligible under this clause shall be the
maximum premium determined under section 256L.15, subdivision 2, paragraph (b).

             l Children enrolled in the original children's health plan and children in families with
income equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, who have other health
insurance, are eligible if the coverage:
    (1) lacks two or more of the following:
    (i) basic hospital insurance;
    (ii) medical-surgical insurance;
    (iii) prescription drug coverage;
    (iv) dental coverage; or
    (v) vision coverage;
    (2) requires a deductible of $100 or more per person per year; or

   (3) lacks coverage because the child has exceeded the maximum coverage for a particular
diagnosis or the policy excludes a particular diagnosis.
    The commissioner may change this eligibility criterion for sliding scale premiums in order to
remain within the limits of available appropriations. The requirement of no health coverage does
not apply to newborns.

Program of the Uniformed Service, CHAMPUS, or other coverage provided under United States

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later. The commissioner of human services shall notify the revisor of statutes when
federal approval is obtained.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. Until June 30, 2009, the sliding fee scale begins with a
premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families
with incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in
effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1,
1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family
size of five. The sliding fee scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five.
The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.

poverty guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base
charge for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum
premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and
administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of
the total. The costs of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and the
enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two enrollees
shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or more enrollees

than 11 members. The members shall be appointed by the commissioner and must have expertise in
benefit design and development in terms of outcomes, actuarial health care analysis, or knowledge
relating to the analysis of the cost impact of coverage of specified benefits. The commissioner
shall convene the first meeting on or before September 1, 2008, upon the appointment of the initial
committee and must meet at least once a year, and at other times as necessary. The commissioner
shall provide office space, equipment and supplies, and technical support to the advisory committee.

    Subd. 4. Benefit set design. (a) The value-based set of health benefits must provide individuals
and families with access to a broad range of health care services, including preventive health care,
without incurring severe financial loss as a result of serious illness or injury. The benefit set must
include health care services, procedures, and diagnostic tests that are scientifically proven to be
both clinically effective and cost effective. The benefit set may require differentiated co-pays and
deductibles based upon the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a particular health care
service. The advisory committee must consider including cost effective and clinically effective
dental care, mental health services, chemical dependency treatment, vision care, language interpreter
services, emergency transportation, and prescription drugs. The committee shall consider cultural,
ethnic, and religious values and beliefs to ensure that the health care needs of all Minnesota residents
are addressed in the benefit set.

    (b) The benefit set must identify and include the following services with minimal or no
cost-sharing requirements, if the committee determines that the savings and health quality
improvements associated with broad access are equal to or greater than the cost of providing the
services: preventive services, chronic care coordination, early diagnostic tests, and outpatient care
for asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and depression.
   (c) The benefit set shall, to the extent possible, be designed to be affordable to Minnesotans
consistent with the affordability standard established in section 62U.09.
   (d) The benefit design must establish a limited number of maximum cost-sharing variations
based upon deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket costs. There must be no maximum lifetime
benefit.

incorporating the benefit design into the state public health care programs and the state employee
group insurance program.
    (f) The commissioners of health and commerce shall report to the legislature on necessary
changes needed to current mandated benefit sets to incorporate the benefit design developed under
this section.
   Subd. 5. Continued review. The commissioner and the committee shall review the benefit set
and design on an ongoing periodic basis and shall adjust the benefit set and design as necessary, to
ensure that the benefit set and design continues to be safe, effective, and scientifically based.
   Sec. 5. [62U.03] HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT REVIEW.
    The commissioner of health, in consultation with the Health Advisory Council, the Institute for
Clinical Systems, and practicing health care providers who either use health technology in their

of measures by which to assess the quality of health care services offered by health care providers,
including health care providers certified as health care homes under section 256B.0751. Quality
measures must be based on medical evidence and be developed through a process in which providers
participate. The measures shall be used for the quality incentive payment system developed in
subdivision 2 and must:
   (1) include uniform definitions, measures, and forms for submission of data, to the greatest extent
possible;
   (2) seek to avoid increasing the administrative burden on health care providers;
   (3) be initially based on existing quality indicators for physician and hospital services, which
10146                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [114TH DAY

are measured and reported publicly by quality measurement organizations including Minnesota
Community Measurement and specialty societies;
   (4) place a priority on measures of health care outcomes, rather than process measures, wherever
possible; and
   (5) incorporate measures for primary care, including preventive services, coronary artery and
heart disease, diabetes, asthma, depression, and other measures as determined by the commissioner.
   (b) The measures shall be reviewed at least annually by the commissioner.
    Subd. 2. Quality incentive payments. (a) By July 1, 2009, the commissioner shall develop a
system of quality incentive payments under which providers are eligible for quality-based payments
that are in addition to existing payment levels, based upon a comparison of provider performance
against specified targets, including improvement over time. The targets must be based upon and
consistent with the quality measures established under subdivision 1.
    (b) To the extent possible, the payment system must adjust for variations in patient population,
in order to reduce incentives to health care providers to avoid high-risk patients or populations.
   (c) The requirements of section 62Q.101 do not apply under this incentive payment system.
    Subd. 3. Quality transparency. The commissioner shall establish standards for measuring
health outcomes, establish a system for risk adjusting quality measures, and issue annual public
reports on provider quality beginning July 1, 2010. By January 1, 2010, physician clinics
and hospitals shall submit standardized electronic information on the outcomes and processes
associated with patient care to the commissioner or the commissioner's designee. In addition to
measures of care processes and outcomes, the report may include other measures designated by
the commissioner, including, but not limited to, care infrastructure and patient satisfaction. The
commissioner shall ensure that any quality data reporting requirements established under this
subdivision are not duplicative of publicly reported, community-wide quality reporting activities
currently under way in Minnesota. Nothing in this subdivision is intended to replace or duplicate
current privately supported activities related to quality measurement and reporting in Minnesota.
    Subd. 4. Contracting. The commissioner may contract with a private entity or consortium of
private entities to complete the tasks in subdivisions 1, 2, and 3. The private entity or consortium
must be nonprofit and have governance that includes representatives from the following stakeholder
groups: health care providers, health plan companies, consumers, employers or other health care
purchasers, and state government. No one stakeholder group shall have a majority of the votes on
any issue or hold extraordinary powers not granted to any other governance stakeholder.
    Subd. 5. Implementation. (a) By January 1, 2010, health plan companies shall use the
standardized quality measures established under this section and shall not require providers to use
and report health plan company-specific quality and outcome measures.
    (b) By July 1, 2010, the commissioner of human services shall implement this incentive payment
system for all enrollees in state health care programs consistent with relevant state and federal statute
and rule.
    (c) By July 1, 2010, the commissioner of finance shall implement this incentive payment system
for all participants in the state employee group insurance program.
114TH DAY]                         MONDAY, MAY 12, 2008                                      10147

   (d) By July 1, 2010, all health plan company incentive based performance payment systems shall

   Sec. 7. [62U.05] PAYMENT RESTRUCTURING; CARE COORDINATION PAYMENTS.
    By July 1, 2010, health plan companies shall integrate health care homes into their provider
networks and shall develop a payment system that provides per-person care coordination payments
to health care providers for providing care coordination services and directly managing onsite
or employing care coordinators for their members who choose to enroll in health care homes
certified by the commissioners of health and human services under section 256B.0751. Health plan
companies shall develop payment conditions and terms for the care coordination fee for health
care homes participating in their network in a manner that is consistent with the system developed
under section 256B.0751. Nothing in this section shall restrict the ability of health plan companies
to selectively contract with health care providers, including health care homes.
  Sec. 8. [62U.06] PAYMENT REFORM TO REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS AND
IMPROVE QUALITY.
    Subdivision 1. Development of uniform standards. The commissioner of health shall develop
the uniform standards identified in this section needed to implement on a broad scale innovative
payment reform that rewards quality and efficiency. The development of the standards must be
completed by January 1, 2010.
    Subd. 2. Calculation of health care costs and quality. The commissioner shall develop a
method of calculating providers' relative cost of care, defined as a measure of health care spending
including resource use and unit prices, and relative quality of care. In developing this method, the
commissioner must address the following issues:
   (1) provider attribution of costs and quality;
   (2) appropriate adjustment for outlier or catastrophic cases;
   (3) appropriate risk adjustment to reflect differences in the demographics and health status
across provider patient populations, using generally accepted and transparent risk adjustment
methodologies;
   (4) specific types of providers that should be included in the calculation;
   (5) specific types of services that should be included in the calculation;
   (6) appropriate adjustment for variation in payment rates;
   (7) the appropriate provider level for analysis;
    (8) payer mix adjustments, including variation across providers in the percentage of revenue
received from government programs; and
   (9) other factors that the commissioner determines are needed to ensure validity and
comparability of the analysis.
    Subd. 3. Provider peer grouping. (a) The commissioner shall develop a peer grouping system
for providers based on a measure that incorporates both provider risk-adjusted cost of care and
10148                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [114TH DAY

quality of care for specific conditions as determined by the commissioner. In developing this system,
the commissioner shall consult and coordinate with health care providers, health plan companies,
state agencies, and organizations that work to improve health care quality in Minnesota. However,
in the final development of this peer grouping system, the commissioner shall not contract with any
private entity, organization, or consortium of entities that has or will have a direct financial interest
in the outcome of this system.
    (b) Beginning June 1, 2010, the commissioner shall disseminate information to providers on
their cost of care, resource use, quality of care, and the results of the grouping developed under
this subdivision in comparison to an appropriate peer group. Any analyses or reports that identify
providers may only be published after the provider has been provided the opportunity by the
commissioner to review the underlying data and submit comments. The provider shall have 21
days to review the data for accuracy.
   (c) The commissioner shall establish an appeals process to resolve disputes from providers
regarding the accuracy of the data used to develop analyses or reports.
    (d) Beginning September 1, 2010, the commissioner shall, no less than annually, publish

    Subdivision 1. Establishment of definitions. (a) The commissioner of health shall establish
uniform definitions for baskets of care beginning with a minimum of 15 baskets of care. In selecting
health conditions for which baskets of care should be defined, the commissioner shall consider
coronary artery and heart disease, diabetes, asthma, and depression. In selecting health conditions,
the commissioner shall also consider the prevalence of the health conditions, the cost of treating
the health conditions, and the potential for innovations to reduce cost and improve quality resulting
from establishing a basket of care for a specific health condition.
    (b) The commissioner shall convene one or more work groups to assist in establishing
these definitions. Each work group shall include members appointed by statewide associations
representing relevant health care providers and health plan companies, and organizations that work
to improve health care quality in Minnesota.

provider accepts as full payment for a health care service based upon the identity of the payer,
upon a contractual relationship with a payer, upon the identity of the patient, or upon whether the
patient has coverage through a group purchaser. This paragraph applies only to health care services
provided to Minnesota residents or to non-Minnesota residents who obtain health insurance through
a Minnesota employer. This paragraph does not apply to a variation based upon a payer being a
governmental entity, to workers' compensation, or no-fault automobile insurance payments. This
paragraph does not affect the right of a provider to provide charity care or care for a reduced price
due to financial hardship of the patient or due to the patient being a relative or friend of the provider.

health care coverage market.
   Sec. 12. [62U.10] EMPLOYEE SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH COVERAGE.
    Subdivision 1. Development of subsidy program. The commissioner of health, in coordination
with the commissioner of human services, shall develop a plan and submit recommendations to the

standard specified in section 62U.09. The maximum subsidy must not exceed the amount of the
subsidy that would have been provided under the MinnesotaCare program, if the individual or
employee and any dependents were eligible for that program.
    Subd. 5. Payment of subsidy. The subsidy amount under this plan for an individual or employee
and any dependents to the individual's or employee's health plan company, shall be credited toward
the individual's or employee's share of premium. Any additional amount paid to the individual's
or employee's health plan company that exceeds the individual's or employee's share of premium
must be credited first toward the individual's or employee's deductible and then toward any other
cost-sharing obligation.
   Sec. 13. [62U.11] PROJECTED AND ACTUAL HEALTH CARE SPENDING.
    Subdivision 1. Projected spending baseline. (a) The commissioner of health shall calculate the
annual projected total health care spending for the state and establish a health care spending baseline
beginning for the calendar year 2008 and for the next ten years based on the annual projected growth
in spending.
    (b) In establishing the health care spending baseline, the commissioner shall use the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services forecast for total growth in national health care expenditures,
and adjust this forecast to reflect the demographics, health status, and other factors deemed
necessary by the commissioner. The commissioner shall contract with an actuarial consultant to
make recommendations as to the adjustments needed to specifically reflect projected spending for
Minnesota residents.
   (c) On an annual basis, the commissioner may adjust the projected baseline as necessary to reflect
any updated federal projections or account for unanticipated changes in federal policy.

or cultural groups disproportionately represented in state health care program enrollment, that
would likely be underrepresented when using traditional measures that are based on longer-term
enrollment.
    Subd. 2. Payment reform. The commissioner of human services shall establish a payment
system to reduce health care costs and improve quality as required under section 62U.06.

insurance benefit plans offered under the managerial plan in Minnesota Statutes, section 43A.18,
subdivision 3.
   Sec. 18. STUDY OF UNIFORM CLAIMS REVIEW PROCESS.
    The commissioner of health shall establish a work group including representatives of the
Minnesota Hospital Association, Minnesota Medical Association, and Minnesota Council of
Health Plans to make recommendations on the potential for reducing claims adjudication costs of
health care providers and health plan companies by adopting more uniform payment methods, and
the potential impact of establishing uniform prices that would replace current prices negotiated
individually by providers with separate payers. The work group shall make its recommendations
to the commissioner by January 1, 2010, and shall identify specific action steps needed to achieve
the recommendations.
