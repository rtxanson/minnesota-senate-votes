described in this section.
   (c) Insurance plans and offerings must be effective no later than July 1, 2010.
   Subd. 3. Board of directors. (a) The Minnesota School Employee Insurance Pool shall be
governed by a board of directors that consists of:
  (1) seven members representing statewide affiliates of exclusive representatives of eligible
employees, appointed by exclusive representatives, as provided in paragraph (b); and
   (2) seven members representing eligible employers, appointed by the Minnesota School Boards
Association.
    (b) The seven members of the board who represent statewide affiliates of exclusive
representatives of eligible employees are appointed as follows: four members appointed by
Education Minnesota and one member each appointed by the Service Employees International
Union, the Minnesota School Employees Association, and the American Federation of State,
County, and Municipal Employees.
    (c) Appointing authorities must make their initial appointments no later than August 1, 2008,
by filing a notice of the appointment with the executive director of the Legislative Coordinating
Commission. Notices of subsequent appointments must be filed with the board. An entity entitled
to appoint a board member may replace the board member at any time.
   (d) Board members are eligible for compensation and expense reimbursement from the pool
under section 15.0575, subdivision 3.
    (e) The board must arrange for one or more methods of dispute resolution so as to minimize the
likelihood of deadlocks.
   (f) The board shall establish governance requirements, which may include staggered terms, term
limits, quorum, a plan of operation, and audit provisions.

Employee Insurance Pool shall be made available by the pool to all eligible employees of eligible
employers, as defined in subdivision 1.

collective bargaining under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act:
  (1) the employer's eligibility requirements regarding the terms and conditions under which
employees, dependents, retirees, and other persons are eligible for health coverage through the
employer;
   (2) how much of the premium charged for the health coverage will be paid by the employer and
how much will be paid by the eligible person; and
   (3) which health plans offered by the pool will be made available by the eligible employer.
115TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2008                                        10189

    (d) The pool must initially offer at least six health plans. One plan must provide coverage
without a deductible and without other enrollee cost-sharing other than reasonable co-payments
for nonpreventive care. One plan must be a high-deductible health plan that qualifies under federal
law for use with a health savings account. The other four plans must have levels of enrollee
cost-sharing that are between the two plans just described. The pool may establish more than one
tier of premium rates for any specific plan. Plans and premium rates may vary across geographic
regions established by the pool. Any health plan purchased through the pool must comply with all
applicable insurance laws, and must provide the optimal combination of coverage, cost, choice,
and stability in the judgment of the pool. The pool shall investigate the feasibility of offering
coverage through more than one health plan company.
    (e) The pool must offer only health plans that are fully insured through a health carrier, as defined
in section 62A.011, subdivision 2, licensed in this state.
    (f) Any health plan offered through the pool must include disease management and consumer
education, including wellness programs and measures encouraging the wise use of health coverage,
to the extent determined to be appropriate by the pool.
    (g) Upon request by the pool, entities that are providing or have provided coverage to employees
of eligible employers within two years before the effective date of this section, shall provide to
the pool at no charge nonidentifiable aggregate claims data for that coverage. The information
must include data relating to employee group benefit sets, demographics, and claims experience.
Notwithstanding section 13.203, Minnesota service cooperatives must also comply with this
paragraph.
    (h) Effective July 1, 2010, a contract entered into between an eligible employer and an eligible
employee or the exclusive representative of an eligible employee may not contain provisions that
establish cash payment in lieu of health coverage to an eligible employee, unless the employee has
been receiving a cash-in-lieu payment on or before June 30, 2010. Nothing in this section prevents
an eligible employee who otherwise qualifies for payment of cash in lieu of insurance on June 30,
2009, from continuing to receive the payment.
    (i) All premiums paid for health coverage provided through the pool must be used by the pool
solely for premiums for health plan coverage provided through the pool, the cost of operation of
the pool, and the benefit of eligible employees and eligible employers in connection with the health
coverage offered through the pool.

is entered into, persons covered through the pool must be rated separately for premium purposes
from other persons covered under section 43A.316 or section 43A.23. The agreement may contain
provisions that vary from those of paragraph (d) to conform to the terms of the plan under section
43A.316 or section 43A.23. An agreement under this paragraph must not result in the pool becoming
self-insured.

legislative changes necessary to ensure conformance with all applicable insurance and other laws.
    Subd. 6. Periodic evaluation. (a) Beginning December 15, 2010, and for the next two years,
the pool must submit an annual written report to the legislature, in compliance with sections 3.195
and 3.197, summarizing and evaluating the performance of the pool during the previous fiscal year
of operation.
    (b) Beginning in 2013 and in each odd-numbered year thereafter, the pool must submit to the
legislature a biennial written report summarizing and evaluating the performance of the pool during
the preceding two fiscal years.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 310, Senate File 3001, the Omnibus K-12 Education Policy
Bill.
This bill represents a step backward for education accountability and high expectations, which are
essential for preparing Minnesota students for the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.
Additionally, this bill features more unfunded mandates and it failed to garner significant bipartisan
support.
115TH DAY]                          TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2008                                      10195

I support the use of a "growth model" for measuring student achievement. It is important for such
a model to be benchmarked against world-class achievement expectations and current academic
standards enacted into law in Minnesota. S.F. 3001 creates a school "growth-to-the-norm" model
which measures school performance against statewide student performance averages. We need to
set high standards and expectations. This bill would mask underperformance of schools and students
compared to rigorous standards.
While the second growth model included in the bill has a greater "growth-to-the-standards" focus,
creating two separate reporting mechanisms for the school performance would serve to confuse
the public and inhibit transparency. Moreover, the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE)
previously submitted a growth-to-standards model to the U.S. Department of Education for
approval. Approval of that model would result in the use of three growth models in Minnesota and
data from all three would be reported on the school report card. Such a result would be cumbersome
and confusing.
The bill also contains a number of new unfunded mandates for school districts, MDE, and
other entities. Caution and restraint should be used when placing new requirements on already
overextended school district and agency staff. Examples of unfunded mandates in S.F. 3001
include:
    A requirement the MDE complete an expedited rulemaking process to adopt state and district
technology standards. That process would require state resources that are not provided. Moreover,
MDE is already partnering with districts to develop technology guidelines for schools to utilize.
    A provision requiring MDE to "encourage" schools and districts to submit individual plans for
closing the achievement gap.
   A number of unfunded task forces and reporting requirements.
Raising the student drop-out age from 16 to 18 years old is a good idea, and sends an important
message to students regarding the value of staying in school. This provision does not address
potential impacts of schools such as disciplinary issues created by students required to stay in
school longer, additional space and material needs, added truancy enforcement, and additional
per-pupil funding. Since the Legislature has delayed implementation of this provision and its fiscal
costs until the 2011-12 school year, I am hopeful we will work together to address these issues in
future legislative sessions.
I am supportive of the reading and literacy language in this bill. It will help young Minnesotans read
at an early age and improve their chances of succeeding in school.
The opportunities and challenges our state and country face in a global economy are real and
demanding. Minnesota parents want their children to have the skills and knowledge needed to
succeed as they face this new reality. Parents, educators, policymakers, and the public deserve an
accurate picture of the progress our students are making toward world-class standards. This bill
misses an opportunity to work together to improve school accountability and transparency.
I hope the Legislature will join me in working to ensure Minnesota has a strong education
accountability system, strong teachers and school leaders, and a commitment to high standards. It
is my hope that we can work collaboratively to accomplish these worthy goals and to help ensure

our students remain globally competitive.

   A bill for an act relating to consumer protection; modifying restrictions on the collection and
use of Social Security numbers; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325E.59, subdivision
3; Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 325E.59, subdivision 1.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2390 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 2390 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 325E.59, subdivision 1, is amended
to read:
   Subdivision 1. Generally. (a) A person or entity, not including a government entity, may not do
any of the following:
   (1) publicly post or publicly display in any manner an individual's Social Security number.
"Publicly post" or "publicly display" means to intentionally communicate or otherwise make
available to the general public;
   (2) print an individual's Social Security number on any card required for the individual to access
products or services provided by the person or entity;
     (3) require an individual to transmit the individual's Social Security number over the Internet,
unless the connection is secure or the Social Security number is encrypted, except as required by
titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act and by Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, section
483.20;
115TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2008                                       10197

    (4) require an individual to use the individual's Social Security number to access an Internet Web
site, unless a password or unique personal identification number or other authentication device is
also required to access the Internet Web site;
    (5) print a number that the person or entity knows to be an individual's Social Security number
on any materials that are mailed to the individual, unless state or federal law requires the Social
Security number to be on the document to be mailed. If, in connection with a transaction involving
or otherwise relating to an individual, a person or entity receives a number from a third party,
that person or entity is under no duty to inquire or otherwise determine whether the number is or
includes that individual's Social Security number and may print that number on materials mailed
to the individual, unless the person or entity receiving the number has actual knowledge that the
number is or includes the individual's Social Security number;
    (6) assign or use a number as the primary account identifier that is identical to or incorporates an
individual's complete Social Security number, except in conjunction with an employee or member
retirement or benefit plan or human resource or payroll administration; or
   (7) sell Social Security numbers obtained from individuals in the course of business.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a), clause (7), "sell" does not include the release of an
individual's Social Security number if the release of the Social Security number is incidental to a
larger transaction and is necessary to identify the individual in order to accomplish a legitimate
business purpose. The release of a Social Security number for the purpose of marketing is not a
legitimate business purpose under this paragraph.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (5), Social Security numbers may be included
in applications and forms sent by mail, including documents sent as part of an application or
enrollment process, or to establish, amend, or terminate an account, contract, or policy, or to
confirm the accuracy of the Social Security number. Nothing in this paragraph authorizes inclusion
of a Social Security number on the outside of a mailing or in the bulk mailing of a credit card
solicitation offer.
   ­
   (b
    ­­) (d) A person or entity, not including a government entity, must restrict access to individual
Social Security numbers it holds so that only its employees, agents, or contractors who require
access to records containing the numbers in order to perform their job duties have access to the
numbers, except as required by titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act and by Code of
Federal Regulations, title 42, section 483.20.

   Subd. 3. Coordination with other law. This section does not prevent:
   (1) the collection, use, or release of a Social Security number as required by state or federal law;
    (2) the collection, use, or release of a Social Security number for a purpose specifically

   That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 6 be further amended as follows:

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 121A.19, is amended to read:
   121A.19 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AID.
    Each school year, the state must pay a district for each child or student screened by the district

not previously been screened according to the requirements of section 121A.17. If this amount of
aid is insufficient, the district may permanently transfer from the general fund an amount that, when
added to the aid, is sufficient. Developmental screening aid shall not be paid for any student who is
screened more than 30 days after the first day of attendance at a public school kindergarten, except
if a student transfers to another public school kindergarten within 30 days after first enrolling in a
Minnesota public school kindergarten program. In this case, if the student has not been screened,
the district to which the student transfers may receive developmental screening aid for screening
that student when the screening is performed within 30 days of the transfer date.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.21, is amended to read:
   122A.21 TEACHERS' AND ADMINISTRATORS' LICENSES; FEES.

the amount set by the Board of Teaching. The processing fee for a teacher's license and for the
licenses of supervisory personnel must be paid to the executive secretary of the appropriate board.
The executive secretary of the board shall deposit the fees with the commissioner of finance. The
fees as set by the board are nonrefundable for applicants not qualifying for a license. However, a fee

fees must be paid to the executive secretary of the Board of Teaching. The revenue generated from
the fee must be deposited in an education licensure portfolio account in the special revenue fund.
The fees set by the Board of Teaching are nonrefundable for applicants not qualifying for a license.
The Board of Teaching may waive or reduce fees for candidates based on financial need.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Basic alternative teacher compensation aid. (a) For fiscal year 2010 and later, the

is a charter school, equals $260 times the number of pupils enrolled in the school on October 1 of
the previous fiscal year, or on October 1 of the current fiscal year for a charter school in the first year
of operation, times the ratio of the sum of the alternative teacher compensation aid and alternative
teacher compensation levy for all participating school districts to the maximum alternative teacher
compensation revenue for those districts under subdivision 1.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subdivision 1, the state total basic alternative teacher
compensation aid entitlement must not exceed $47,485,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $76,067,000

     Subd. 5. Alternative teacher compensation levy. For fiscal year 2010 and later, the alternative
teacher compensation levy for a district receiving basic alternative teacher compensation aid equals
the product of: (1) the difference between the district's alternative teacher compensation revenue,
under subdivision 1, and the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid, under subdivision
4; times (2) the lesser of one or the ratio of the district's adjusted net tax capacity per adjusted pupil
unit to $5,913.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2010 and later.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Alternative teacher compensation aid. (a) For fiscal year 2010 and later, a
district's alternative teacher compensation equalization aid equals the district's alternative teacher
compensation revenue, minus the district's basic alternative teacher compensation aid, minus
the district's alternative teacher compensation levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount
permitted under subdivision 5, the alternative teacher compensation equalization aid must be
reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied.
    (b) A district's alternative teacher compensation aid equals the sum of the district's basic
alternative teacher compensation aid and the district's alternative teacher compensation equalization
aid.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2010 and later.

authorized unless a petition signed by more than 15 percent of the registered voters of the district
is filed with the school board within 30 days of the board's adoption of a resolution stating the
board's intention to issue bonds. The percentage is to be determined with reference to the number of
registered voters in the district on the last day before the petition is filed with the board. The petition
must call for a referendum on the question of whether to issue the bonds for the projects under this
section. The approval of 50 percent plus one of those voting on the question is required to pass a
referendum authorized by this section.
    (d) The bonds must be paid off within ­e t­n

compliance with chapter 475, except as otherwise provided in this section. A tax levy must be made
for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds in accordance with section 475.61. The sum
of the tax levies under this section and section 123B.61 for each year must not exceed the limit
specified in section 123B.61. The levy for each year must be reduced as provided in section 123B.61.
A district using an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the bonds shall report the
amount used for this purpose to the commissioner by July 15 of the following fiscal year. A district
having an outstanding capital loan under section 126C.69 or an outstanding debt service loan under
section 126C.68 must not use an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the bonds.
   (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (d), bonds issued by a district within the first five years following
voter approval of a combination according to section 123A.37, subdivision 2, must be paid off within
20 years of issuance. All the other provisions and limitation of paragraph (d) apply.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Pupils in adjoining states. Except as provided under an agreement with an adjoining
state under section 124D.041, a non-Minnesota pupil who resides in an adjoining state in a district
that borders Minnesota may enroll in a Minnesota district if either the board of the district in which
the pupil resides or state in which the pupil resides pays tuition to the district in which the pupil is
enrolled.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.04, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Tuition payments. (a) In each odd-numbered year, before March 1, the commissioner
must agree to rates of tuition for Minnesota elementary and secondary pupils attending in other states
for the next two fiscal years when the other state agrees to negotiate tuition rates. The commissioner
must negotiate equal, reciprocal rates with the designated authority in each state for pupils who
reside in an adjoining state and enroll in a Minnesota district. The rates must be at least equal to the
tuition specified in section 124D.05, subdivision 1. If the other state does not agree to negotiate a
general tuition rate, a Minnesota school district may negotiate a tuition rate with the school district
in the other state that sends a pupil to or receives a pupil from the Minnesota school district. The
tuition rate for a pupil with a disability must be equal to the actual cost of instruction and services
provided. The resident district of a Minnesota pupil attending in another state under this section
must pay the amount of tuition agreed upon in this section to the district of attendance, prorated on
the basis of the proportion of the school year attended.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subdivision 9, if an agreement is reached between the
state of Minnesota and an adjoining state pursuant to section 124D.041, the provisions of section
124D.041 and the agreement shall apply to all enrollment transfers between Minnesota and the
adjoining state, and provisions of paragraph (a) and subdivision 9 shall not apply.

    Subd. 9. Appeal to the commissioner. If a Minnesota school district cannot agree with an

   Subdivision 1. Agreements. (a) The commissioner may enter into an agreement with the
designated authority from an adjoining state to establish an enrollment options program between
Minnesota and the adjoining state. Any agreement entered into pursuant to this section must
specify the following:
    (1) for students who are not residents of Minnesota, the enrollment options program applies only
to a student whose resident school district borders Minnesota;
    (2) the commissioner must negotiate equal, reciprocal rates with the designated authority from
the adjoining state;
    (3) if the adjoining state sends more students to Minnesota than Minnesota sends to the adjoining
state, the adjoining state must pay the state of Minnesota the rate agreed upon under clause (2) for
the excess number of students sent to Minnesota;
    (4) if Minnesota sends more students to the adjoining state than the adjoining state sends to
Minnesota, the state of Minnesota will pay the adjoining state the rate agreed upon under clause (2)
for the excess number of students sent to the adjoining state;
   (5) the application procedures for the enrollment options program between Minnesota and the
adjoining state;

pupil units for fiscal year 2004, times the difference between: (1) the lesser of the district's general
education revenue per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit for fiscal year 2003 or the amount of general
education revenue the district would have received per adjusted marginal cost pupil unit for fiscal
year 2004 according to Minnesota Statutes 2002, and (2) the district's general education revenue for
fiscal year 2004 excluding transition revenue divided by the number of adjusted marginal cost pupil
units the district would have counted for fiscal year 2004 under Minnesota Statutes 2002.

   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.17, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Referendum revenue. (a) The revenue authorized by section 126C.10, subdivision
1, may be increased in the amount approved by the voters of the district at a referendum called
for the purpose. The referendum may be called by the board or shall be called by the board upon
written petition of qualified voters of the district. The referendum must be conducted one or two
calendar years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one
election to approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted
by mail under paragraph (g), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue per resident
marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board, of increased
revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the number of years
for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall increase annually
by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual inflationary increase
calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing referendum levy

existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount, if any, over the
expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number of years, not to
exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a ballot on the
question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must abbreviate
the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under section
275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies at the same amount per pupil
as in the previous year:

giving mailed notice under this subdivision, owners must be those shown to be owners on the records
of the county auditor or, in any county where tax statements are mailed by the county treasurer,
on the records of the county treasurer. Every property owner whose name does not appear on the
records of the county auditor or the county treasurer is deemed to have waived this mailed notice
unless the owner has requested in writing that the county auditor or county treasurer, as the case
may be, include the name on the records for this purpose. The notice must project the anticipated
amount of tax increase in annual dollars for typical residential homesteads, agricultural homesteads,
apartments, and commercial-industrial property within the school district.

   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.40, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. To lease building or land. (a) When an independent or a special school district
or a group of independent or special school districts finds it economically advantageous to rent
or lease a building or land for any instructional purposes or for school storage or furniture repair,
and it determines that the operating capital revenue authorized under section 126C.10, subdivision
13, is insufficient for this purpose, it may apply to the commissioner for permission to make an
additional capital expenditure levy for this purpose. An application for permission to levy under
this subdivision must contain financial justification for the proposed levy, the terms and conditions
of the proposed lease, and a description of the space to be leased and its proposed use.
    (b) The criteria for approval of applications to levy under this subdivision must include: the
reasonableness of the price, the appropriateness of the space to the proposed activity, the feasibility
of transporting pupils to the leased building or land, conformity of the lease to the laws and rules
of the state of Minnesota, and the appropriateness of the proposed lease to the space needs and the
financial condition of the district. The commissioner must not authorize a levy under this subdivision
in an amount greater than the cost to the district of renting or leasing a building or land for approved
purposes. The proceeds of this levy must not be used for custodial or other maintenance services.
A district may not levy under this subdivision for the purpose of leasing or renting a district-owned
building or site to itself.

for the purpose of leasing: (1) a newly constructed building used primarily for regular kindergarten,
elementary, or secondary instruction; or (2) a newly constructed building addition or additions used
primarily for regular kindergarten, elementary, or secondary instruction that contains more than 20
percent of the square footage of the previously existing building.
   (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a district may levy under this subdivision for the purpose

of leasing or renting a district-owned building or site to itself only if the amount is needed by the
district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement,
or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, and the levy meets the requirements of
paragraph (c). A levy authorized for a district by the commissioner under this paragraph may be
in the amount needed by the district to make payments required by a lease purchase agreement,
installment purchase agreement, or other deferred payments agreement authorized by law, provided
that any agreement include a provision giving the school districts the right to terminate the agreement

times the resident pupil units for the fiscal year to which the levy is attributable.
   (f) For agreements for which a review and comment have been submitted to the Department of
Education after April 1, 1998, the term "instructional purpose" as used in this subdivision excludes
expenditures on stadiums.
   (g) The commissioner of education may authorize a school district to exceed the limit in
paragraph (e) if the school district petitions the commissioner for approval. The commissioner
shall grant approval to a school district to exceed the limit in paragraph (e) for not more than five
years if the district meets the following criteria:
   (1) the school district has been experiencing pupil enrollment growth in the preceding five years;
   (2) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term public interest;
   (3) the purpose of the increased levy promotes colocation of government services; and
   (4) the purpose of the increased levy is in the long-term interest of the district by avoiding over
construction of school facilities.
    (h) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with leases of administrative and classroom space
for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed ­$­25­ $43 times the adjusted
marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to any other authority
authorized under this section.
    (i) In addition to the allowable capital levies in paragraph (a), a district that is a member of
the "Technology and Information Education Systems" data processing joint board, that finds it
economically advantageous to enter into a lease purchase agreement for a building for a group of
school districts or special school districts for staff development purposes, may levy for its portion
of lease costs attributed to the district within the total levy limit in paragraph (e).

purposes specified in this section. The maximum amount which may be levied for all costs under
this section shall be equal to $30 multiplied by the district's adjusted marginal cost pupil units
for the school year. The proceeds of the levy must be reserved and used for directly funding the
following purposes or for reimbursing the cities and counties who contract with the district for the

costs for licensed school counselors, licensed school nurses, licensed school social workers, licensed
school psychologists, and licensed alcohol and chemical dependency counselors to help provide
early responses to problems. For expenditures under clause (1), the district must initially attempt
to contract for services to be provided by peace officers or sheriffs with the police department of
each city or the sheriff's department of the county within the district containing the school receiving
the services. If a local police department or a county sheriff's department does not wish to provide
the necessary services, the district may contract for these services with any other police or sheriff's
department located entirely or partially within the school district's boundaries.
    (b) A school district that is a member of an intermediate school district may include in its
authority under this section the costs associated with safe schools activities authorized under
paragraph (a) for intermediate school district programs. This authority must not exceed $10 times
the adjusted marginal cost pupil units of the member districts. This authority is in addition to
any other authority authorized under this section. Revenue raised under this paragraph must be
transferred to the intermediate school district.

    The aggregate of such borrowings under this subdivision shall never exceed 75 percent of such
aids, fees, and tuition payments which are receivable by the intermediate school district in the fiscal
year in which the money is borrowed, as estimated and certified by the commissioner.
    (b) The board of an intermediate school district may, upon receipt of a written resolution by
each of its member school districts, pledge the member district's full faith and credit and unlimited
taxing powers to repay each member district's pro rata share of any certificates issued or the amount
paid by the state under section 126C.55, subdivision 2, plus interest, if the revenues specified in
paragraph (a) and any other revenues of the intermediate school district are insufficient to do so.

  126C.55 STATE PAYMENT OF DEBT OBLIGATION UPON POTENTIAL DEFAULT;
REPAYMENT; STATE OBLIGATION NOT DEBT.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the term "debt obligation" means:
         t­x

                                   ­n
   (2) a certificate of participation issued under section 126C.40, subdivision 6; or
   (3) a general obligation bond.
    Subd. 2. Notifications; payment; appropriation. (a) If a school district or intermediate school
district believes that it may be unable to make a principal or interest payment on any outstanding
debt obligation on the date that payment is due, it must notify the commissioner as soon as possible,
but not less than 15 working days before the date that principal or interest payment is due. The notice
must include the name of the school district or intermediate school district, an identification of the
debt obligation issue in question, the date the payment is due, the amount of principal and interest
due on the payment date, the amount of principal or interest that the school district or intermediate
school district will be unable to repay on that date, the paying agent for the debt obligation, the
wire transfer instructions to transfer funds to that paying agent, and an indication as to whether a
payment is being requested by the school district or intermediate school district under this section.
If a paying agent becomes aware of a potential default, it shall inform the commissioner of that
fact. After receipt of a notice which requests a payment under this section, after consultation with
the school district or intermediate school district and the paying agent, and after verification of the
accuracy of the information provided, the commissioner shall notify the commissioner of finance
of the potential default. The notice must include a final figure as to the amount due that the school
district or intermediate school district will be unable to repay on the date due.
    (b) Except as provided in subdivision 9, upon receipt of this notice from the commissioner, the
commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant and authorize the commissioner of education to pay to
the paying agent for the debt obligation the specified amount on or before the date due. The amounts
needed for the purposes of this subdivision are annually appropriated to the department from the
state general fund.
    (c) The Departments of Education and Finance must jointly develop detailed procedures
for school districts and intermediate school districts to notify the state that they have obligated
themselves to be bound by the provisions of this section, procedures for school districts or
intermediate school districts and paying agents to notify the state of potential defaults and to
request state payment under this section, and procedures for the state to expedite payments to
prevent defaults. The procedures are not subject to chapter 14.
   Subd. 3. School district bound; interest rate on state paid amount. If, at the request of a
school district or intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest
due on a district's debt obligation on a specific date, the school district or intermediate school district
115TH DAY]                            TUESDAY, MAY 13, 2008                                           10217

is bound by all provisions of this section and the amount paid shall bear taxable interest from the
date paid until the date of repayment at the invested cash rate as it is certified by the commissioner
of finance. Interest shall only accrue on the amounts paid and outstanding less the reduction in aid
under subdivision 4 and other payments received from the district.
    Subd. 4. Pledge of district's full faith and credit. If, at the request of a school district or
intermediate school district, the state has paid part or all of the principal or interest due on a district's
debt obligation on a specific date, the pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers
of the school district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay the principal and
interest due on those debt obligations shall also, without an election or the requirement of a further
authorization, become a pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers of the school
district or the member districts of the intermediate district to repay to the state the amount paid, with
interest. Amounts paid by the state must be repaid in the order in which the state payments were
made.
    Subd. 4a. Aid reduction for repayment. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, the state
must reduce the state aid payable to the school district or intermediate school district under this
chapter and chapters 122A, 123A, 123B, 124D, 125A, 126C, and 273 by the amount paid by the
state under this section on behalf of the district, plus the interest due on it, and the amount reduced
must revert from the appropriate account to the state general fund. Payments from the school district
endowment fund or any federal aid payments shall not be reduced.
    (b) For an intermediate school district, the state aid payable to the intermediate school district
must first be reduced, before any reduction is made to the state aids payable to the member districts.
If the state aid payable to the intermediate school district is not sufficient to repay the state, state
aid payable to member districts may be reduced proportionately based on the ratio of each member
district's adjusted net tax capacity to the total adjusted net tax capacity of all member districts.
    (c) If, after review of the financial situation of the school district or intermediate school
district, the commissioner advises the commissioner of finance that a total reduction of aids would
cause an undue hardship on or an undue disruption of the educational program of the district, the
commissioner, with the approval of the commissioner of finance, may establish a different schedule
for reduction of aids to repay the state. The amount of aids to be reduced is decreased by any
amounts repaid to the state by the district from other revenue sources.
    Subd. 6. Tax levy for repayment. (a) With the approval of the commissioner, a district may
levy in the year the state makes a payment under this section an amount up to the amount necessary
to provide funds for the repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the district. The proceeds of this levy may be used only for this purpose
unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess shall be used to repay
other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the debt redemption fund of the
school district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the district for purposes of section
275.065, subdivision 6. The amount of aids to be reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by
the amount levied. This levy by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section
123B.53.
    (b) If the state is not repaid in full for a payment made under this section by November 30
of the calendar year following the year in which the state makes the payment, the commissioner
shall require the district to certify a property tax levy in an amount up to the amount necessary
10218                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [115TH DAY

to provide funds for repayment of the amount paid by the state plus interest through the date of
estimated repayment by the school district. To prevent undue hardship, the commissioner may allow
the district to certify the levy over a five-year period. The proceeds of the levy may be used only
for this purpose unless they are in excess of the amount actually due, in which case the excess
shall be used to repay other state payments made under this section or shall be deposited in the
debt redemption fund of the district. This levy shall be an increase in the levy limits of the school
district for purposes of section 275.065, subdivision 6. If the commissioner orders the district to
levy, the amount of aids reduced to repay the state shall be decreased by the amount levied. This levy
by the district is not eligible for debt service equalization under section 123B.53 or any successor
provision. A levy under this subdivision must be explained as a specific increase at the meeting
required under section 275.065, subdivision 6.
    (c) For an intermediate district, a levy made by a member district under paragraph (a) or (b) to
pay its pro rata share must be spread by the commissioner as a tax rate based on the total adjusted
net tax capacity of the member school districts. The proceeds of the levy must be remitted by the
member school district to the intermediate school district and must be used by the intermediate
district only to repay the state amounts owed. Any amount in excess of the amount owed to the
state must be repaid to the member school districts and the commissioner shall adjust each member
district's property tax levy in the next year.
    Subd. 7. Election as to mandatory application. A school district or intermediate school district
may covenant and obligate itself, prior to the issuance of an issue of debt obligations, to notify the
commissioner of a potential default and to use the provisions of this section to guarantee payment
of the principal and interest on those debt obligations when due. If the district obligates itself to
be bound by this section, it must covenant in the resolution that authorizes the issuance of the debt
obligations to deposit with the paying agent three business days prior to the date on which a payment
is due an amount sufficient to make that payment or to notify the commissioner under subdivision 1
that it will be unable to make all or a portion of that payment. A district that has obligated itself must
include a provision in its agreement with the paying agent for that issue that requires the paying agent
to inform the commissioner if it becomes aware of a potential default in the payment of principal
or interest on that issue or if, on the day two business days prior to the date a payment is due on
that issue, there are insufficient funds to make the payment on deposit with the paying agent. Funds
invested in a refunding escrow account established under section 475.67 that are to become available
to the paying agent on a principal or interest payment date are deemed to be on deposit with the
paying agent three business days before the payment date. If a district either covenants to be bound
by this section or accepts state payments under this section to prevent a default of a particular issue
of debt obligations, the provisions of this section shall be binding as to that issue as long as any debt
obligation of that issue remain outstanding. If the provisions of this section are or become binding
for more than one issue of debt obligations and a district is unable to make payments on one or more
of those issues, the district must continue to make payments on the remaining issues.
    Subd. 8. Mandatory plan; technical assistance. If the state makes payments on behalf of a
school district or intermediate school district under this section or the district defaults in the payment
of principal or interest on an outstanding debt obligation, it must submit a plan to the commissioner
for approval specifying the measures it intends to implement to resolve the issues which led to its
inability to make the payment and to prevent further defaults. The department must provide technical
assistance to the district in preparing its plan. If the commissioner determines that a district's plan
is not adequate, the commissioner shall notify the district that the plan has been disapproved, the

reasons for the disapproval, and that the state shall not make future payments under this section
for debt obligations issued after the date specified in that notice until its plan is approved. The
commissioner may also notify the district that until its plan is approved, other aids due the district
will be withheld after a date specified in the notice.
    Subd. 9. State bond rating. If the commissioner of finance determines that the credit rating of
the state would be adversely affected thereby, the commissioner of finance shall not issue warrants
under subdivision 2 for the payment of principal or interest on any debt obligations for which a
district did not, prior to their issuance, obligate itself to be bound by the provisions of this section.
    Subd. 10. Continuing disclosure agreements. The commissioner of finance may enter into
written agreements or contracts relating to the continuing disclosure of information needed to
facilitate the ability of school districts or intermediate school districts to issue debt obligations
according to federal securities laws, rules, and regulations, including securities and exchange
commission rules and regulations, section 240.15c2-12. Such agreements or contracts may be in
any form the commissioner of finance deems reasonable and in the state's best interests.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 127A.49, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Abatements. Whenever by virtue of chapter 278, sections 270C.86, 375.192, or
otherwise, the net tax capacity or referendum market value of any district for any taxable year is
changed after the taxes for that year have been spread by the county auditor and the local tax rate
as determined by the county auditor based upon the original net tax capacity is applied upon the
changed net tax capacities, the county auditor shall, prior to February 1 of each year, certify to
the commissioner of education the amount of any resulting net revenue loss that accrued to the
district during the preceding year. Each year, the commissioner shall pay an abatement adjustment
to the district in an amount calculated according to the provisions of this subdivision. This amount
shall be deducted from the amount of the levy authorized by section 126C.46. The amount of the
abatement adjustment must be the product of:
   (1) the net revenue loss as certified by the county auditor, times
   (2) the ratio of:
    (i) the sum of the amounts of the district's certified levy in the third preceding year according to
the following:
