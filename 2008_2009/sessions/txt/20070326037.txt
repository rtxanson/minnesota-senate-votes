the United States Department of Transportation to participate in the Federal State Rail Safety
Partnership Program for training and certification of an inspector under authority of United States

bridges, overhead structures, and traffic and other public crossings; inspect yards and physical
plants; review and enforce safety requirements; review maintenance and repair records; and review
railroad security measures. To the extent delegated by the commissioner, the inspector may issue
citations for violations of this chapter, or to ensure railroad employee and public safety and welfare.
    (b) The commissioner shall annually assess railroad companies that are (1) defined as common
carriers under section 218.011, (2) classified by federal law or regulation as Class I Railroads or
Class I Rail Carriers, and (3) operating in this state by a divisor of equal proportion between carriers
in equal amounts for 365 days of the calendar year. The commissioner shall assess all start-up
or reestablishment costs, and all related costs of initiating the state rail safety inspector program
beginning July 1, 2007. The state rail inspector duties must begin and be assessed on January 1, 2008.
The assessments must be deposited in a special account in the special revenue fund, to be known as
the state rail safety inspection account. Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner
and may be expended to cover the costs incurred for the establishment and ongoing responsibilities
of the state rail safety inspector.
    (c) The commissioner may exempt a common carrier not federally classified as Class I from
violations for a period of up to two years if the common carrier applies for participation in a work
site safety coaching program, such as the "MNSharp" program administered by the Minnesota
Department of Labor and Industry, and the commissioner determines such participation to be
preferred enforcement for safety or security violations.
    (d) Any person aggrieved by an assessment levied under this section may appeal within 90 days
any assessment, violation, or administrative penalty to the Office of Administrative Hearings, with
further appeal and review by the district court.
