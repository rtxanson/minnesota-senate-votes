The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
    We, the undersigned conferees for H. F. No. 2285 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the Senate recede from its amendment and that H. F. No. 2285 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
   An amendment to the Minnesota Constitution is proposed to the people. If the amendment is
adopted, a section will be added to article XI, to read:
    Sec. 15. Beginning July 1, 2009, until June 30, 2034, the sales and use tax rate shall be increased
by three-eighths of one percent on sales and uses taxable under the general state sales and use
tax law. Receipts from the increase, plus penalties and interest and reduced by any refunds, are
dedicated, for the benefit of Minnesotans, to the following funds: 33 percent of the receipts shall
be deposited in the outdoor heritage fund and may be spent only to restore, protect, and enhance
wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife; 33 percent of the receipts shall
be deposited in the clean water fund and may be spent only to protect, enhance, and restore water
quality in lakes, rivers, and streams and to protect groundwater from degradation, and at least five
percent of the clean water fund must be spent only to protect drinking water sources; 14.25 percent
of the receipts shall be deposited in the parks and trails fund and may be spent only to support parks
and trails of regional or statewide significance; and 19.75 percent shall be deposited in the arts and
cultural heritage fund and may be spent only for arts, arts education, and arts access and to preserve
Minnesota's history and cultural heritage. An outdoor heritage fund; a parks and trails fund; a clean
water fund and a sustainable drinking water account; and an arts and cultural heritage fund are
created in the state treasury. The money dedicated under this section shall be appropriated by law.
The dedicated money under this section must supplement traditional sources of funding for these
purposes and may not be used as a substitute. Land acquired by fee with money deposited in the
outdoor heritage fund under this section must be open to the public taking of fish and game during
the open season unless otherwise provided by law. If the base of the sales and use tax is changed, the
sales and use tax rate in this section may be proportionally adjusted by law to within one-thousandth
of one percent in order to provide as close to the same amount of revenue as practicable for each
fund as existed before the change to the sales and use tax.
   Sec. 2. SUBMISSION TO VOTERS.
   (a) The proposed amendment shall be submitted to the people at the 2008 general election. The
question submitted shall be:
   "Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to dedicate funding to protect our drinking water

   (b) The title required under Minnesota Statutes, section 204D.15, subdivision 1, for the question
submitted to the people under paragraph (a) shall be "Clean Water, Wildlife, Cultural Heritage, and
