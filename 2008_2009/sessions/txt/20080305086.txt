  Senator Rest from the Committee on State and Local Government Operations and
Oversight, to which was referred
   S.F. No. 457: A bill for an act relating to elections; providing for establishment of single-member

   And when so amended the bill do pass. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

  Senator Rest from the Committee on State and Local Government Operations and
Oversight, to which was referred
    S.F. No. 2211: A bill for an act relating to elections; establishing districting principles for
legislative and congressional plans; providing for appointment of a commission to recommend
the boundaries of legislative and congressional districts; limiting redistricting to once per decade;
amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 2.021; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota
Statutes, chapter 2; repealing Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 2.031.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
    Page 1, line 16, delete "eight districts" and insert "the number of districts apportioned to this
state by the United States"
   Page 1, delete subdivisions 2 and 3 and insert:
    "Subd. 2. Nesting. A representative district may not be divided in the formation of a senate
district.
   Subd. 3. Equal population. (a) Legislative districts must be substantially equal in population.
The population of a legislative district must not deviate from the ideal by more than two percent,

plus or minus.
   (b) Congressional districts must be as nearly equal in population as practicable.
    Subd. 4. Contiguity; compactness. The districts must be composed of convenient contiguous
territory structured into compact units. Contiguity by water is sufficient. Territory that touches only
at a point is not contiguous, unless the territory is within the same city or town.
    Subd. 5. Numbering. (a) The legislative districts must be numbered in a regular series, beginning
with house district 1A in the northwest corner of the state and proceeding across the state from west
to east, north to south, but bypassing the seven-county metropolitan area until the southeast corner
has been reached; then to the seven-county metropolitan area outside the counties of Hennepin and
Ramsey; then in Hennepin and finally in Ramsey.
    (b) The congressional district numbers must begin with district one in the southeast corner of
the state and end with the district with the highest number in the northeast corner of the state.
    Subd. 6. Minority representation. The districts must not dilute the voting strength of racial
or language minority populations. Where a concentration of a racial or language minority makes it
possible and it can be done in compliance with the other principles in this resolution, the districts
must increase the probability that members of the minority will be elected.
    Subd. 7. Preserving political subdivisions. A county, city, or town must not be divided into
more than one district except as necessary to meet equal population requirements or to form districts
that are composed of convenient, contiguous, and compact territory. When a county, city, or town
must be divided into more than one district, it should be divided into as few districts as possible.
    Subd. 8. Communities of interest. The districts should attempt to preserve communities of
interest where that can be done in compliance with the preceding principles. For purposes of this
principle, "communities of interest" include, but are not limited to, geographic areas where there are
clearly recognizable similarities of social, political, cultural, ethnic, or economic interests, or that
are linked by common transportation or communication.
   Subd. 9. Political competitiveness. The districts must be created to encourage political
competitiveness, as defined by the commission established under section 2.025.
    Subd. 10. Incumbents. The districts must not be drawn for the purpose of protecting or defeating
an incumbent.
    Subd. 11. Priority. Where it is not possible to fully comply with the principles provided in
subdivisions 1 to 10, a redistricting plan must give priority to those principles in the order in which
the subdivisions are listed in this section, except to the extent that doing so would violate federal or
state law."
   Page 2, delete subdivision 1 and insert:
    "Subdivision 1. Appointment. By March 1 of each year ending in one, the leaders of the
legislature shall appoint a redistricting commission as provided in this subdivision to draw the
boundaries of legislative and congressional districts in accordance with the principles established
in section 2.021. The commission consists of five retired judges of the appellate or district courts of
this state who have not served in a party designated or party endorsed position, such as legislator.

The majority leader of the senate, the minority leader of the senate, the speaker of the house, and
the minority leader of the house shall each appoint one judge, after consulting with each other in an
effort to attain geographic balance in their appointments. If an appointing authority fails to make
an appointment by the deadline, the vacancy must be filled by appointment by the chief justice of
the supreme court no later than March 8 of that year. The four judges thus appointed shall, by a
vote of at least three judges, choose the fifth judge. The five judges shall select one of their number
to serve as chair of the commission."

   "Subd. 5. Plans submitted to commission. The commission shall adopt a schedule for interested
persons to submit proposed plans to the commission and to respond to plans proposed by others.
The commission shall adopt standards to govern the format of plans submitted to it.
   Subd. 6. Public hearings. The commission shall hold at least three public hearings in different

    S.F. No. 3322: A bill for an act relating to human services; improving management of state
health care programs; modifying managed care contracting; limiting managed care administrative
expenses; modifying county-based purchasing; requiring mandated reports; amending Minnesota
Statutes 2006, sections 13.461, by adding a subdivision; 256B.69, subdivision 5a, by adding
subdivisions; 256B.692, subdivision 2, by adding subdivisions; 256L.12, subdivision 9; Laws
2005, First Special Session chapter 4, article 8, section 84, as amended.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.461, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 24a. Managed care plans. Data provided to the commissioner of human services by
managed care plans relating to contracts and provider payment rates are classified under section
256B.69, subdivision 9b.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and sections
256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when

the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical assistance
and general assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each
performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except
in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of
each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a
broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan
efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner
may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan,
including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned
no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The
commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23. A managed care
plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include as admitted assets
under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph that is reasonably expected to be
returned.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5i. Administrative expenses. (a) Managed care plan and county-based purchasing plan
administrative costs for a prepaid health plan provided under this section or section 256B.692 must
not exceed by more than five percent that prepaid health plan's or county-based purchasing plan's
actual calculated administrative spending for the previous calendar year as a percentage of total
revenue. The penalty for exceeding this limit must be the amount of administrative spending in
excess of 105 percent of the actual calculated amount. The commissioner may waive this penalty if
the excess administrative spending is the result of unexpected shifts in enrollment or member needs
or new program requirements.
    (b) Capitated rate payments for administrative costs must be reduced to exclude onetime or
sporadic expenditures in the prior year unless the managed care plan certifies that the expenditure
will recur during the contract year. The commissioner shall verify these certifications on an annual
basis and recoup any payments made for onetime or sporadic expenditures that did not occur in the
prior year.
   (c) Expenses listed under section 62D.12, subdivision 9a, clause (4), are not allowable
administrative expenses for rate-setting purposes under this section, unless approved by the
commissioner.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5j. Treatment of investment earnings. Capitation rates shall treat investment income
and interest earnings as income to the same extent that investment-related expenses are treated as
administrative expenditures.

purchasing plan must provide to the commissioner detailed information on administrative spending,
including:
    (1) itemized lists of costs for claims processing and provider network management;
    (2) detailed reports of costs for contracts with providers and third-party administrators;
    (3) a detailed analysis of administrative spending for each Minnesota health care program;
   (4) a detailed analysis of the provider's allocation of administrative expenses among its public
and commercial lines of business;
    (5) a detailed analysis of administrative costs by service category; and
   (6) a detailed analysis of onetime and sporadic expenditures included in the administrative
spending category.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9b. Reporting of subcontracts and provider payment rates. (a) Each managed care
plan and county-based purchasing plan must provide to the commissioner:
    (1) detailed information on contracts with health care providers; and
   (2) detailed information on reimbursement rates paid by the managed care plan to providers
under contract with the plan.
    (b) Data provided to the commissioner under this subdivision are nonpublic data as defined in
section 13.02.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.692, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

county that elects to purchase medical assistance and general assistance medical care in return for a
fixed sum without regard to the frequency or extent of services furnished to any particular enrollee
is not required to obtain a certificate of authority under chapter 62D or 62N. The county board
of commissioners is the governing body of a county-based purchasing program. In a multicounty
arrangement, the governing body is a joint powers board established under section 471.59.
    (b) A county that elects to purchase medical assistance and general assistance medical care
services under this section must satisfy the commissioner of health that the requirements for
assurance of consumer protection, provider protection, and, effective January 1, 2010, fiscal
solvency of chapter 62D, applicable to health maintenance organizations,                   ­­

86TH DAY]                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 2008                                      6919

    Subd. 9. Rate setting; performance withholds. (a) Rates will be prospective, per capita, where
possible. The commissioner may allow health plans to arrange for inpatient hospital services on
a risk or nonrisk basis. The commissioner shall consult with an independent actuary to determine
appropriate rates.
    (b) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, the commissioner
shall withhold .5 percent of managed care plan payments under this section pending completion
of performance targets. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later
than July 31 of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. A managed
care plan may include as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this
paragraph that is reasonably expected to be returned.
    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments under this section pending completion of performance
targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably
attainable, except in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule.
Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract
effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that
the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner
shall periodically change the administrative measures used as performance targets in order to
improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative services. The performance
targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending on health care services and
administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance targets that
take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics of the plan's enrollee
population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31
of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. A managed care
plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include as admitted assets
under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph that is reasonably expected to
be returned.
   Sec. 10. Laws 2005, First Special Session chapter 4, article 8, section 84, as amended by Laws
2006, chapter 264, section 15, is amended to read:
       Sec. 84. SOLE-SOURCE OR SINGLE-PLAN MANAGED CARE CONTRACT.
    (a) Notwithstanding Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.692, subdivision 6, clause (1), paragraph
(c), the commissioner of human services shall approve a county-based purchasing health plan
proposal, submitted on behalf of Cass, Crow Wing, Morrison, Todd, and Wadena Counties, that
requires county-based purchasing on a single-plan basis contract if the implementation of the
single-plan purchasing proposal does not limit an enrollee's provider choice or access to services
and all other requirements applicable to health plan purchasing are satisfied. The commissioner
shall continue until January 1, 2010, single health plan purchasing arrangements with county-based
purchasing entities in the service areas in existence on May 1, 2006, including arrangements for
which a proposal was submitted by May 1, 2006, on behalf of Cass, Crow Wing, Morrison, Todd,
and Wadena Counties, in response to a request for proposals issued by the commissioner. The
commissioner shall reopen all counties for competitive reprocurement every five years, beginning
in 2011.
   (b) The commissioner shall consider, and may approve, contracting on a single-health plan basis

    The commissioner of human services shall report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes,
section 3.195, by January 15, 2009, with the following information regarding financial management
of health care programs:
    (1) a status report on implementation of the cost containment strategies identified in the 2005
"Strategies for Savings" report. The report must include:
      (i) information on progress made towards implementation of cost-saving strategies;
      (ii) an explanation of why certain strategies were not implemented; and
   (iii) where appropriate, alternative strategies to those recommended in 2005 for containing public
health care program costs;
   (2) a description of and, to the extent possible, an explanation of recent differences between the
health plan net revenue targets established by the commissioner for health plans participating in
public health care programs and the actual net revenue realized by the plans from public programs;
    (3) the adequacy of public health care program for fee-for-service rates, including an
identification of service areas or geographical regions where enrollees have difficulty accessing
providers as the result of inadequate provider payments. This report must include recommendations
to increase rates as needed to eliminate identified access problems; and
    (4) a progress report on implementation of Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.76, paragraph (e),
requiring payments for physician and professional services to be based on Medicare relative value
units, and an estimated completion date for implementation of this payment system.

REQUIREMENTS.
    (a) The commissioner of health shall develop and report to the legislature under Minnesota
Statutes, section 3.195, by January 15, 2009, guidelines to ensure that health plans, and county-based
purchasing plans where applicable, have consistent procedures for allocating administrative
expenses and investment income across their commercial and public lines of business and
across individual public programs. The guidelines shall be consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles and principles from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The guidelines shall not have the effect of changing allocation for Medicare-related programs as

permitted by federal law and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
    (b) The commissioner of health, in cooperation with the commissioners of commerce and human
services, shall develop and report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.195, by
January 15, 2009, detailed standards and procedures for examining the reasonableness of health plan
and county-based purchasing plan administrative expenditures for publicly funded programs. These
standards and procedures must include a process for detailed examinations of individual programs
and functional areas.
    (c) The commissioner of health shall develop and report to the legislature under Minnesota
Statutes, section 3.195, by January 15, 2009, a more efficient method for a health plan, and a
county-based purchasing plan where appropriate, to demonstrate to the commissioner that providers
in the plan's network have appropriate credentials. The commissioner shall review issues regarding:
   (1) the duplicate review of credentials at a health care provider by multiple health plans;
    (2) the review of the credentials of all staff of a health care provider when only limited staff will
be in the plan network; and
   (3) other duplicative credentialing issues.
   Sec. 13. OMBUDSMAN FOR MANAGED CARE STUDY.
    The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with the ombudsman for managed care,
shall study and report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.195, by January 15,
2009, with recommendations on whether the duties of the ombudsman should be expanded to
include advocating on behalf of public health care program fee-for-service enrollees. The report
must include:
   (1) a comparison of the recourse available to managed care clients versus fee-for-service clients
when service problems occur; and
   (2) an estimate of any net cost increase from this change in the ombudsman's duties, taking into
account any reduction in the commissioner's duties.
   Sec. 14. REPORTING MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE DATA.
    The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with the commissioner of health, shall
report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.195, by January 15, 2009, with
recommendations on the adoption of a single method to compute and publicly report managed
health care performance measures in order to avoid confusion about the plans' performance levels.
The study must include recommendations regarding coordinated use by the two agencies of the
following data sources:
   (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) from managed care
organizations;
   (2) data that health plans submit to claim reimbursement for health care procedures; and
   (3) data collected from medical record reviews of randomly selected individuals."

service, other than prepaid per minute service that does not require a minimum term agreement
from the customer, in the state must:
   (1) provide the customer, at the time of sale, with a coverage map showing where service is
generally available and that identifies areas where any domestic roaming or additional charges would
apply to the customer's service;
86TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 2008                                         6947

    (2) make coverage maps showing where service is generally available to prospective and existing
customers at any location where the wireless carrier's wireless telecommunications service is offered
for sale and make those maps available electronically at the carrier's Web site;
    (3) clearly and conspicuously disclose at the time of sale the price for the service being purchased
by the customer, including the monthly access fee or base charge, the amount of any activation or
initiation fee, any charges for domestic roaming, any charge for domestic long distance, any charge
for exceeding the number of minutes or usage included in any allowance, and any other charges
collected and retained by the carrier and disclose a good faith estimate of the amount or range of all
applicable government-mandated or authorized charges and taxes;
    (4) clearly and conspicuously disclose to the customer at the time of sale, in at least 12-point font
in written materials: (i) that the price is not guaranteed to remain the same for the minimum term
of the contract if a contract provision allows the wireless carrier to change the price of the service
during the minimum term, and (ii) any early termination fee that applies if service is terminated
during the minimum term; and
    (5) prior to the execution of a contract for wireless telephone service, provide the customer the
terms of the contract, and after execution of the contract provide the customer with a copy of the
writing or writings constituting the contract, at the time of sale and thereafter upon the customer's
request.
    (b) With regard to any early termination fee provisions or provisions allowing the wireless carrier
to change the price of the service during the minimum contract term, the wireless carrier must
obtain a specific acknowledgment from the customer that the customer has read and understands
the provisions.
    Subd. 3. Billing; listing of government taxes and fees. All bills for wireless
telecommunications services must list government-mandated charges and taxes in a section
of the bill separate from the section or sections listing the price and any other charges for the
wireless telecommunications service. The wireless carrier must include a brief, easy-to-understand
description of each charge included in the bill. The wireless carrier must not represent, expressly
or by implication, that discretionary cost recovery fees or charges are government-mandated
charges and taxes.
    Subd. 4. Billing for third-party goods and services. (a) A wireless carrier must not include on
a customer's bill a charge for goods or services that the carrier bills on behalf of a third party unless
the wireless carrier has obtained the customer's prior express authorization to include those charges
on the customer's bill issued by the wireless carrier.
    (b) If a customer of a wireless carrier disputes any third-party charge appearing on that customer's
wireless bill, the customer shall not be obligated to pay the disputed charge until the wireless carrier
provides evidence of the customer's prior express authorization to include such charge. Evidence
of the customer's prior express authorization must be produced to the customer within 60 calendar
days after the customer notifies the wireless carrier that the charge is disputed. A customer shall be
permitted to dispute any charges that a wireless carrier bills on behalf of a third party for up to six
months after the charge appears on the customer's wireless bill. If the wireless carrier cannot produce
evidence that the customer authorized the third-party charge, the wireless carrier must remove the
charge from the customer's wireless bill and credit the customer for the unauthorized third-party
charges incurred during the previous six months.

      (c) A wireless carrier meets the prior express authorization requirements of this subdivision only
if it obtains or receives authorization from the customer containing clear, unambiguous, and separate
authorizations for each third-party good or service to be included on the customer's bill.
    (d) Nothing in this subdivision restricts the right of a wireless carrier to seek to recover from a
third party unauthorized charges credited to the customer by the wireless carrier.
    Subd. 5. Extensions in contract length. (a) If a customer is offered, accepts, or requests a good,
service, or promotion or changes the customer's wireless service plan in any manner, and this good,
service, promotion, or change will result in the extension of the minimum contract term or create a
new contract with a minimum term, the wireless carrier must disclose to the customer at the point
of sale or acceptance that the requested good, service, promotion, or change will result in a contract
extension or creation of a new contract with a minimum term, and must further disclose the length
of the extension or new term.
    (b) If the customer and a representative of the carrier are personally present at the point of
sale or acceptance, the wireless provider must also in connection with the new good, service,
promotion, or change obtain the customer's signed consent in an independent document. The
independent document must only include the terms set forth in clauses (1) to (3) and must clearly
and conspicuously disclose in at least 14-point font:
    (1) that the new good, service, promotion, or change will result in an extension or renewal of
the customer's contract;
   (2) the new contract start and end dates; and
    (3) that failure to complete the new contract term may result in early termination fees and, if so,
the amount of the fees.
     (c) If the customer's consent is obtained via the Internet, the wireless provider must disclose in
at least 14-point font the terms listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3). The customer must provide
a valid electronic signature showing that the wireless provider has disclosed and the customer has
agreed to the extension or renewal of the contract. An electronic record must be available upon
request to the customer until the new contract term expires.
    (d) If the customer's consent is obtained orally, the wireless provider must clearly disclose the
terms listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3), and the customer's consent to each term must be
recorded and retained by the provider and be made available upon request to the customer until the
new contract term expires.
   (e) Within ten days after a customer's contract has been extended or renewed, the wireless service
provider must notify the customer in an independent writing that the contract has been extended or
renewed. The independent writing must only include the terms set forth in clauses (1) to (3) and
must clearly and conspicuously disclose in at least 14-point font:
    (1) that the new good, service, promotion, or change will result in an extension or renewal of
the customer's contract;
   (2) the new contract start and end dates; and
   (3) that failure to complete the new contract term may result in early termination fees and, if so,

the amount of the fees.
    (f) Failure of the provider to make any of the disclosures or to obtain any of the consents required
in this subdivision voids any contract extension covered by this subdivision.
    Subd. 6. Consumer remedies may not be limited. A wireless carrier may not limit by contract
the right of a subscriber to bring complaints or the rights and remedies available to a subscriber
by law, including class actions, in any state or federal court or agency of competent jurisdiction.
A wireless carrier may not by contract hold subscribers liable for carrier legal costs resulting from
complaints before the commission, the courts, or another agency. A contract between a wireless
carrier and a customer may not require that disputes under the contract be submitted to arbitration.
    Subd. 7. Remedies; penalties, enforcement. A violation of this section is a violation of a law
referred to in section 8.31, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 8. Severability. Each of the provisions of this section, and each application of a provision
to particular circumstances, is severable. If a provision or application is found to be contrary to law
and unenforceable, it is the intention of the legislature that the remaining provisions and applications
of this section remain valid and enforceable to the full extent possible under section 645.20.
   Sec. 2. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325F.695, is repealed.
   Sec. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Section 1 is effective August 1, 2008, except that subdivision 4 is effective March 1, 2009."

86TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 2008                                         6955

homesteaded. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of
land has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22. The value of the remaining
land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead property
has a net class rate of 0.55 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first tier has a
class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier valuation
limit of agricultural homestead property" and "first tier" means the limit certified under section
273.11, subdivision 23.
    (b) Class 2b property is (1) real estate, rural in character and used exclusively for growing
trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood products; (2) real estate that is not improved with
a structure and is used exclusively for growing trees for timber, lumber, and wood and wood
products, if the owner has participated or is participating in a cost-sharing program for afforestation,
reforestation, or timber stand improvement on that particular property, administered or coordinated
by the commissioner of natural resources; (3) real estate that is nonhomestead agricultural land; or
(4) a landing area or public access area of a privately owned public use airport. Class 2b property
has a net class rate of one percent of market value, except that unplatted property described in
clause (1) or (2) has a net class rate of .65 percent if it consists of no less than ten and no more than
1,920 acres and is being managed under a forest management plan that meets the requirements of
chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource management incentive program,
provided that the owner of the property must apply to the assessor annually to receive the reduced
class rate and provide the information required by the assessor to verify that the property qualifies
for the reduced rate.
    (c) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more,
used during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this
section means the raising or cultivation of agricultural products. "Agricultural purposes" also
includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535
or the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 if the property
was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the
year prior to its enrollment. Contiguous acreage on the same parcel, or contiguous acreage on an
immediately adjacent parcel under the same ownership, may also qualify as agricultural land, but
only if it is pasture, timber, waste, unusable wild land, or land included in state or federal farm
programs. Agricultural classification for property shall be determined excluding the house, garage,
and immediately surrounding one acre of land, and shall not be based upon the market value of any
residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.
    (d) Real estate, excluding the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one acre of land, of
less than ten acres which is exclusively and intensively used for raising or cultivating agricultural
products, shall be considered as agricultural land.
   Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (e) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:

   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or
cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
    (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under
section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, and not sold for timber, lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (f) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (g) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), a privately owned public use
airport must be licensed as a public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of paragraph (b),
clause (4), "landing area" means that part of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared,
regularly maintained, and made available to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways,

taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area
also includes land underlying both the primary surface and the approach surfaces that comply with
all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under paragraph (b), clause (4), must be described and certified
by the commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the
airport or landing area no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (4). For purposes
of paragraph (b), clause (4), "public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp,
apron, or storage hangar, or an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter."
