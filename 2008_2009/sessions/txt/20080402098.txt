   "Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.191, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Determination of sales factor. For purposes of this section, the following rules apply
in determining the sales factor.
    (a) The sales factor includes all sales, gross earnings, or receipts received in the ordinary course
of the business, except that the following types of income are not included in the sales factor:
   (1) interest;
   (2) dividends;
   (3) sales of capital assets as defined in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
    (4) sales of property used in the trade or business, except sales of leased property of a type which
is regularly sold as well as leased;
    (5) sales of debt instruments as defined in section 1275(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code or
sales of stock; and
    (6) royalties, fees, or other like income of a type which qualify for a subtraction from federal
taxable income under section 290.01, subdivision 19d(10).
   (b) Sales of tangible personal property are made within this state if the property is received by a
purchaser at a point within this state, and the taxpayer is taxable in this state, regardless of the f.o.b.
point, other conditions of the sale, or the ultimate destination of the property.
    (c) Tangible personal property delivered to a common or contract carrier or foreign vessel for
delivery to a purchaser in another state or nation is a sale in that state or nation, regardless of f.o.b.
point or other conditions of the sale.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c), when intoxicating liquor, wine, fermented malt
beverages, cigarettes, or tobacco products are sold to a purchaser who is licensed by a state or
political subdivision to resell this property only within the state of ultimate destination, the sale is
made in that state.
   (e) Sales made by or through a corporation that is qualified as a domestic international sales
corporation under section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered to have been made
within this state.
    (f) Sales, rents, royalties, and other income in connection with real property is attributed to the
state in which the property is located.
    (g) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, including finance leases and
true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state and to other states
if the property is not located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of moving property
8266                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [98TH DAY

including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
    (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles
traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state is
determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
     (h) Royalties and other income not described in paragraph (a), clause (6), received for the use
of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs,
processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer
lists, or similar items, must be attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser.
If the property is used in more than one state, the royalties or other income must be apportioned
to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state
cannot be determined, the royalties or other income must be excluded from both the numerator and
the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property
or the rights therein in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the
location of the purchaser's customers.
    (i) Sales of intangible property are made within the state in which the property is used by the
purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the sales must be apportioned to this state
pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be
determined, the sale must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the sales
factor. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser used the intangible property in the
regular course of its business operations in this state.
    (j) Receipts from the performance of services must be attributed to the state where the services
are received. For the purposes of this section, receipts from the performance of services provided
to a corporation, partnership, or trust may only be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of
doing business. If the state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state
where the corporation, partnership, or trust receiving the service does not have a fixed place of doing
business, the services shall be deemed to be received at the location of the office of the customer
from which the services were ordered in the regular course of the customer's trade or business. If
the ordering office cannot be determined, the services shall be deemed to be received at the office
of the customer to which the services are billed.
  (k) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, paragraph (l), receipts from
management, distribution, or administrative services performed by a corporation or trust for a fund

of a corporation or trust regulated under United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 through 80a-64,
must be attributed to the state where the shareholder of the fund resides. Under this paragraph,
receipts for services attributed to shareholders are determined on the basis of the ratio of: (1) the
average of the outstanding shares in the fund owned by shareholders residing within Minnesota
at the beginning and end of each year; and (2) the average of the total number of outstanding
shares in the fund at the beginning and end of each year. Residence of the shareholder, in the case
of an individual, is determined by the mailing address furnished by the shareholder to the fund.
Residence of the shareholder, when the shares are held by an insurance company as a depositor for
the insurance company policyholders, is the mailing address of the policyholders. In the case of an
insurance company holding the shares as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, if
the mailing address of the policyholders cannot be determined by the taxpayer, the receipts must be
excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Residence of other shareholders is the mailing
address of the shareholder.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2008.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.191, subdivision 6, is amended to read:

                                           su
section, the rules in this subdivision and ­­­ ­­v

                                                        ­ subdivisions 5, paragraph (k), and 8 apply in
determining the receipts factor for financial institutions.
    (b) "Receipts" for this purpose means gross income, including net taxable gain on disposition
of assets, including securities and money market instruments, when derived from transactions and
activities in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
   (c) "Money market instruments" means federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, and purchased certificates of deposit
and similar instruments to the extent that the instruments are reflected as assets under generally
accepted accounting principles.
    (d) "Securities" means United States Treasury securities, obligations of United States
government agencies and corporations, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate
stock, bonds, and other securities, participations in securities backed by mortgages held by United
States or state government agencies, loan-backed securities and similar investments to the extent
the investments are reflected as assets under generally accepted accounting principles.
    (e) Receipts from the lease or rental of real or tangible personal property, including both finance
leases and true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state. Receipts
from the lease or rental of tangible personal property that is characteristically moving property,
including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment
are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state.
The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:
   (1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.
   (2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts
from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled
within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles

traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.
    (3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from
the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of
the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.
    (4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state
is determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of property by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and
the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.
    (f) Interest income and other receipts from assets in the nature of loans that are secured primarily
by real estate or tangible personal property must be attributed to this state if the security property is
located in this state under the principles stated in paragraph (e).
   (g) Interest income and other receipts from consumer loans not secured by real or tangible
personal property that are made to residents of this state, whether at a place of business, by traveling
loan officer, by mail, by telephone or other electronic means, must be attributed to this state.
     (h) Interest income and other receipts from commercial loans and installment obligations that are
unsecured by real or tangible personal property or secured by intangible property must be attributed
to this state if the proceeds of the loan are to be applied in this state. If it cannot be determined where
the funds are to be applied, the income and receipts are attributed to the state in which the office of
the borrower from which the application would be made in the regular course of business is located.
If this cannot be determined, the transaction is disregarded in the apportionment formula.
    (i) Interest income and other receipts from a participating financial institution's portion of
participation and syndication loans must be attributed under paragraphs (e) to (h). A participation
loan is an arrangement in which a lender makes a loan to a borrower and then sells, assigns, or
otherwise transfers all or a part of the loan to a purchasing financial institution. A syndication loan
is a loan transaction involving multiple financial institutions in which all the lenders are named as
parties to the loan documentation, are known to the borrower, and have privity of contract with
the borrower.
    (j) Interest income and other receipts including service charges from financial institution credit

attributed to the state to which the card charges and fees are regularly billed.
    (k) Merchant discount income derived from financial institution credit card holder transactions
with a merchant must be attributed to the state in which the merchant is located. In the case of

to rebuttal, that the location of a merchant is the address shown on the invoice submitted by the
merchant to the taxpayer.
    (l) Receipts from the performance of fiduciary and other services must be attributed to the state in
which the services are received. For the purposes of this section, services provided to a corporation,
partnership, or trust must be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of doing business. If the
state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state where the corporation,
partnership, or trust does not have a fixed place of doing business, the services shall be deemed to

be received at the location of the office of the customer from which the services were ordered in the
regular course of the customer's trade or business. If the ordering office cannot be determined, the
services shall be deemed to be received at the office of the customer to which the services are billed.
    (m) Receipts from the issuance of travelers checks and money orders must be attributed to the
state in which the checks and money orders are purchased.
    (n) Receipts from investments of a financial institution in securities and from money market
instruments must be apportioned to this state based on the ratio that total deposits from this state, its
residents, including any business with an office or other place of business in this state, its political
subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities bear to the total deposits from all states, their residents,
their political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. In the case of an unregulated financial
institution subject to this section, these receipts are apportioned to this state based on the ratio that
its gross business income, excluding such receipts, earned from sources within this state bears to
gross business income, excluding such receipts, earned from sources within all states. For purposes
of this subdivision, deposits made by this state, its residents, its political subdivisions, agencies,
and instrumentalities must be attributed to this state, whether or not the deposits are accepted or
maintained by the taxpayer at locations within this state.
   (o) A financial institution's interest in property described in section 290.015, subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), is included in the receipts factor in the same manner as assets in the nature of securities
or money market instruments are included in paragraph (n).

      The motion did not prevail. So the amendment was not adopted.
      Senator Vandeveer moved to amend S.F. No. 2869 as follows:
      Page 41, after line 34, insert:
      "Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.1384, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Residential homestead market value credit. Each county auditor shall
determine a homestead credit for each class 1a, 1b, and 2a homestead property within the county
equal to 0 .­ 0.33 percent of the first $76,000 of market value of the property minus .09 percent of
         ­­4
the market value in excess of $76,000. The credit amount may not be less than zero. In the case of
an agricultural or resort homestead, only the market value of the house, garage, and immediately
surrounding one acre of land is eligible in determining the property's homestead credit. In the
case of a property that is classified as part homestead and part nonhomestead, (i) the credit shall
apply only to the homestead portion of the property, but (ii) if a portion of a property is classified
as nonhomestead solely because not all the owners occupy the property, not all the owners have
qualifying relatives occupying the property, or solely because not all the spouses of owners occupy
the property, the credit amount shall be initially computed as if that nonhomestead portion were
also in the homestead class and then prorated to the owner-occupant's percentage of ownership.
For the purpose of this section, when an owner-occupant's spouse does not occupy the property,
the percentage of ownership for the owner-occupant spouse is one-half of the couple's ownership
percentage.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2009 and thereafter."

with the estimated tax benefits provided to the business by participating in JOBZ; and
    (3) whether other financial assistance is available.
   (b) Additionally, the commissioner may only approve a business subsidy agreement after
considering if without the estimated tax benefits, the business:
    (1) would not have expanded or began operations within Minnesota;
    (2) would not have relocated from outside the state to Minnesota; or
   (3) would have moved to another state or expanded in another state rather than remaining or
expanding in Minnesota.

   (3) the qualified business is required to report all jobs created or retained because of JOBZ as a
separate business location for purposes of section 268.044; and
   (4) the qualified business agrees to provide the appropriate data practices release so that the
commissioner of revenue and the commissioner of employment and economic development can

subsidy agreements so that reports are due throughout the year and compliance reviews are done on
a continuous basis as reports are filed.

hearing as required under section 116J.994, subdivision 5, before approving a business subsidy
agreement. Public notice of a proposed business subsidy agreement must be published in a local
newspaper of general circulation. The public hearing must be held in a location specified by the

   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16B.32, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Onsite energy generation from renewable sources. A state agency that prepares
a predesign for a new building must consider meeting at least two percent of the energy needs of
the building from renewable sources located on the building site. For purposes of this subdivision,
"renewable sources" are limited to wind and the sun. The predesign must include an explicit cost
and price analysis of complying with the two-percent requirement compared with the present and
future costs of energy supplied by a public utility from a location away from the building site and the
present and future costs of controlling carbon emissions. If the analysis concludes that the building
should not meet at least two-percent of its energy needs from renewable sources located on the
building site, the analysis must provide explicit reasons why not. The building may not receive
further state appropriations for design or construction unless at least two percent of its energy needs
are designed to be met from renewable sources, unless the commissioner finds that the reasons given
by the agency for not meeting the two-percent requirement were supported by evidence in the record.
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16B.325, is amended to read:
   16B.325 SUSTAINABLE BUILDING GUIDELINES.
    Subdivision 1. Development of sustainable building guidelines. The Department of
Administration and the Department of Commerce, with the assistance of other agencies, shall
develop sustainable building design guidelines for all new state buildings by January 15, 2003,
and for all major renovations of state buildings by February 1, 2009. The primary objectives of
these guidelines are to ensure that all new state buildings, and major renovations of state buildings,
initially exceed ­
                 ex   t­n
                    i­­i
                  ­­s   ­g­ the state energy code, as established in Minnesota Rules, chapter 7676,
by at least 30 percent.
    Subd. 2. Lowest possible cost; energy conservation. The guidelines must focus on achieving
the lowest possible lifetime cost for new buildings and major renovations, and allow for changes
in the guidelines that encourage continual energy conservation improvements in new buildings and
major renovations. The guidelines shall define "major renovations" for purposes of this section.
98TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2008                                       8363

The definition may not allow "major renovations" to encompass less than 10,000 square feet or to
encompass less than the complete replacement of the mechanical, ventilation, or cooling system
of the building or a section of the building. The design guidelines must establish sustainability
guidelines that include air quality and lighting standards and that create and maintain a healthy
environment and facilitate productivity improvements; specify ways to reduce material costs; and
must consider the long-term operating costs of the building, including the use of renewable energy
sources and distributed electric energy generation that uses a renewable source or natural gas or a
fuel that is as clean or cleaner than natural gas.
   Subd. 3. Development of guidelines; applicability. In developing the guidelines, the
departments shall use an open process, including providing the opportunity for public comment.
The guidelines established under this section are mandatory for all new buildings receiving funding
from the bond proceeds fund after January 1, 2004, and for all major renovations receiving funding
from the bond proceeds fund after January 1, 2009.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16B.335, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Other projects. All other capital projects for which a specific appropriation is made
must not proceed until the recipient undertaking the project has notified the chair of the senate
Finance Committee, the chair of the house Capital Investment Committee, and the chair of the
house Ways and Means Committee that the work is ready to begin. Notice is not required for capital
projects needed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for asset preservation projects
to which section 16A.307 applies, or for projects funded by an agency's operating budget or by a

government, a state agency, a county where the watershed district is located in whole or in part, or
a financial institution authorized under chapter 47 to do business in this state. A county board may
lend the amount requested by a watershed district. A watershed district may not have more than a

   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under a
replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a local
governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by the
board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481, under
a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. Mining
reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
8364                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [98TH DAY

   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (e),
the local government unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at
least ten years unless the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local
government unit may require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk
of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity
to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill stormwater
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), for a wetland or public waters wetland located on
nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.
    (g) For a wetland or public waters wetland located on agricultural land or in a greater than 80
percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
    (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are subject
to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
   (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from

previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.
    (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to the
state and its departments and agencies.
    (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, "transportation
project" does not include an airport project.
     (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in the
filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on-site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.

     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.
    (n) If a landowner seeks approval of a replacement plan after the proposed project has already
affected the wetland, the local government unit may require the landowner to replace the affected
wetland at a ratio not to exceed twice the replacement ratio otherwise required.
   (o) A local government unit may request the board to reclassify a county or watershed on
the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph (o) or provide a reason why the petition is
denied.

    Subdivision 1. Bonding authority. (a) The commissioner of finance, if requested by the
commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency, shall sell and issue state revenue bonds for the
following purposes:
   (1) to take actions related to hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants at and from
qualified landfill facilities as provided in section 115B.42, subdivision 2;
   (2) to pay the costs of issuance, debt service, and bond insurance or other credit enhancements
and to fund reserves; and
   (3) to refund bonds issued under this section.
    (b) The amount of bonds that may be issued for the purposes of paragraph (a), clause (1), may
not exceed $25,000,000. The amount of bonds that may be issued for the purposes of paragraph (a),
clauses (2) and (3), is not limited.
    Subd. 2. Procedure. The commissioner of finance may sell and issue the bonds on the terms
and conditions the commissioner of finance determines to be in the best interests of the state. The
bonds may be sold at public or private sale. The commissioner of finance may enter any agreements
or pledges the commissioner of finance determines necessary or useful to sell the bonds that are
not inconsistent with this section. Sections 16A.672 to 16A.675 apply to the bonds. The proceeds
of the bonds issued under this section must be credited to a special bond proceeds account in the

bonds. The proceeds of the refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the commissioner of finance,
be applied to the purchases or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or the redemption
of the outstanding bonds on the first redemption date after delivery of the refunding bonds and
may, until so used, be placed in escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption.

Refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be issued and secured in the manner provided
by the commissioner of finance.
   Subd. 5. Not a general or moral obligation. Bonds issued under this section are not public
debt, and the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of the state are not pledged for their payment. The
bonds may not be paid, directly in whole or in part from a tax of statewide application on any class of
property, income, transaction, or privilege. Payment of the bonds is limited to the revenues explicitly
authorized to be pledged under this section. The state neither makes nor has a moral obligation to
pay the bonds if the pledged revenues and other legal security for them is insufficient.
   Subd. 6. Trustee. The commissioner of finance may contract with and appoint a trustee for
bondholders. The trustee has the powers and authority vested in it by the commissioner of finance
under the bond and trust indentures.
    Subd. 7. Pledges. Any pledge made by the commissioner of finance is valid and binding from the
time the pledge is made. The money or property pledged and later received by the commissioner of
finance is immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the property
or money or further act, and the lien of any pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having
claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the commissioner of finance, whether or
not those parties have notice of the lien or pledge. Neither the order nor any other instrument by
which a pledge is created need be recorded.
    Subd. 8. Bonds; purchase and cancellation. The commissioner of finance, subject to
agreements with bondholders that may then exist, may, out of any money available for the purpose,
purchase bonds of the commissioner of finance at a price not exceeding (1) if the bonds are then
redeemable, the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment
date thereon, or (2) if the bonds are not redeemable, the redemption price applicable on the first
date after the purchase upon which the bonds become subject to redemption plus accrued interest
to that date.
    Subd. 9. State pledge against impairment of contracts. The state pledges and agrees with the
holders of any bonds that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the commissioner of
finance to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the bondholders, or in any way impair
the rights and remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with interest on them, with interest
on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or
proceeding by or on behalf of the bondholders, are fully met and discharged. The commissioner of
finance may include this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders of
bonds issued under this section.

Capital project includes projects to retrofit, expand, or construct new treatment facilities.
    Subd. 2. Grants for capital project design. The agency shall make grant awards to political
subdivisions for up to 50 percent of the costs to predesign and design capital projects that
demonstrate the beneficial use of wastewater. The maximum amount for a grant under this
subdivision is $500,000. The grant agreement must provide that the predesign and design work
being funded is public information and available to anyone without charge. The agency must make
the predesign and design work available on its Web site.
    Subd. 3. Grants for capital project implementation. The agency shall make grant awards to
political subdivisions for up to 50 percent of the costs to acquire, construct, install, furnish, and
equip capital projects that demonstrate the beneficial use of wastewater. The political subdivision
must submit design plans and specifications to the agency as part of the application.
    The agency must consult with the Public Facilities Authority and the commissioner of natural
resources in reviewing and ranking applications for grants under this section.
    The application must identify the uses of the treated wastewater and greater weight will be given
to applications that include a binding commitment to participate by the user or users.
   The agency must give preference to projects that will reduce use of the greatest volume of
groundwater from aquifers with the slowest rate of recharge.
   Subd. 4. Application form; procedures. The agency shall develop an application form and
procedures.
    Subd. 5. Reports. The agency shall report by February 1 of each year to the chairs of the house
and senate committees with jurisdiction over environment policy and finance and capital investment
on the grants made and projects funded under this section. For each demonstration project funded,
the report must include information on the scale of water constraints for the area, the volume of
treated wastewater supply, the quality of treated wastewater supplied and treatment implications for
the industrial user, impacts to stream flow and downstream users, and any considerations related to
water appropriation and discharge permits.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.423, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Grants authorized. Notwithstanding subdivision 2, the commissioner may use money
in the fund to make grants to a municipality or county, or to a county regional rail authority as
appropriate, for public infrastructure needed to support an eligible project under this section. Grant
money may be used by the municipality, county, or regional rail authority to acquire right-of-way
and mitigate loss of wetlands and runoff of storm water; to predesign, design, construct, and equip
roads and rail lines; and, in cooperation with municipal utilities, to predesign, design, construct, and
equip natural gas pipelines, electric infrastructure, water supply systems, and wastewater collection
and treatment systems. Grants made under this subdivision are available until expended.

      Subd. 2. Grant priority. (a) The commissioner must give priority to:
   (1) projects in counties or municipalities with the highest percentage of children living in
poverty;
      (2) grants that involve collaboration among sponsors of programs under this section; and
   (3) where feasible, grants for programs that utilize Youthbuild under sections 116L.361 to
116L.366 for at least 25 percent of each grant awarded or $50,000 of the labor portion of the
construction, whichever is less, if:
   (i) the work is appropriate for Youthbuild, as mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the local
Youthbuild program, considering safety and skills needed;
    (ii) it is demonstrated by Youthbuild that using Youthbuild will not increase the overall cost of
the project; and
    (iii) eligible programs consult with appropriate labor organizations to deliver education and
training.
      (b) The commissioner may give priority to:
    (1) projects that collaborate with child care providers, including all-day and school-age child care
programs, special needs care, sick child care, nontraditional hour care, and programs that include
services to refugee and immigrant families.   ­­T

  Sec. 46. [137.63] BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH FACILITIES FUNDING
PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Program established. A biomedical science research facilities funding program
is established to provide appropriations to the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota for
up to 75 percent of the project costs for each of four projects approved by the Board of Regents
under section 137.64.
    Subd. 2. Project requirements. The Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota, either
acting on its own or in collaboration with another private or public entity, must pay at least 25 percent
of the project costs for each of four projects. The board must not use tuition revenue to pay for the
university's share of the costs for the projects approved under section 137.64.
   Sec. 47. [137.64] CONDITIONS FOR PAYMENTS TO UNIVERSITY.
    Subdivision 1. Certifications. Before the commissioner may make any payments authorized
in this section to the Board of Regents for a biomedical science research facility project, the
commissioner must certify that the board has, by board resolution, approved the maximum project
cost for the project and complied with the requirements of section 137.63, subdivision 2. For each
project approved by the board, the board must certify to the commissioner the amount of the annual
payments of principal and interest required to service each series of bonds issued by the University
of Minnesota for the project, and the actual amount of the state's annual payment to the University
of Minnesota under subdivision 2. The annual payment must not exceed the amount required to
pay debt service on the bonds issued to finance 75 percent of the project costs.
    Subd. 2. Payments. On July 15 of each year after the certification under subdivision 1, but
no earlier than July 15, 2009, and for so long thereafter as any bonds issued by the board for the
construction of a project are outstanding, the state must transfer to the board annual payments as
certified under subdivision 1, up to the maximum amounts in the appropriation schedule under
subdivision 3. Payments under this section are to reimburse the Board of Regents for the state's
share of the project costs for the biomedical science research facility projects, provided that the
principal amount of bonds issued by the University of Minnesota to pay the state's share of the costs
must not exceed $219,000,000.
   Subd. 3. Appropriations. Annual appropriations are made from the general fund to the
commissioner of finance for transfer to the Board of Regents, as follows:

    Subd. 4. Report to legislature. The Board of Regents must report to the committees of the
legislature with responsibility for capital investment by January 15 of each even-numbered year on
the biomedical science research facility projects authorized under this section. The report must at
a minimum include for each project, the total cost, the number of researchers, research grants, and
the amount of debt issued by the Board.
    Subd. 5. Reinvestment. The Board of Regents must, to the extent permitted under federal law
and University of Minnesota policies, place a priority on reducing the state's share of project costs by
dedicating a share of the proceeds from any commercialization or licensing revenues attributable to
research conducted in the biomedical science facilities to reducing the appropriations needed under
subdivision 3.
    Subd. 6. Services to individuals and firms. Consistent with its mission and governing policies
and the requirements for tax exempt bonds, the university shall make available laboratory and other
