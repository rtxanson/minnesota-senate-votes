    The minimum content levels in clauses (3) and (4) are effective during the months of April,
May, June, July, August, September, October only. The minimum content for the remainder of
the year is five percent. However, if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution
control determine, after consultation with the biodiesel task force and other technical experts, that
an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard exists
for the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses that adequately addresses technical issues
associated with Minnesota's cold weather and publish a notice in the State Register to that effect,
the commissioners may allow the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses to be effective
year-round.
    (b) The minimum content levels in paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), become effective on
the date specified only if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control
publish notice in the State Register and provide written notice to the chairs of the house and senate
committees with jurisdiction over agriculture, commerce, and transportation policy and finance, at
least 270 days prior to the date of each scheduled increase, that all of the following conditions have
been met and the state is prepared to move to the next scheduled minimum content level:
    (1) an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard
exists for the next minimum diesel-biodiesel blend;
    (2) a sufficient supply of biodiesel is available and the amount of biodiesel produced in this state
is equal to at least 50 percent of anticipated demand at the next minimum content level; and
   (3) adequate blending infrastructure and regulatory protocol are in place in order to promote
biodiesel quality and avoid any potential economic disruption.
   (c) The commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control must consult with the
biodiesel task force when assessing and certifying conditions in paragraph (b), and in general must

seek the guidance of the biodiesel task force regarding biodiesel labeling, enforcement, and other
related issues.
    (d) During a period of biodiesel fuel shortage or a problem with biodiesel quality that negatively
affects the availability of biodiesel fuel, the commissioner of commerce may temporarily suspend
the minimum content requirement in subdivision 2 until there is sufficient biodiesel fuel, as defined
in subdivision 1, available to fulfill the minimum content requirement.
    (e) By February 1, 2012, and periodically thereafter, the commissioner of commerce shall
determine the wholesale diesel price at various pipeline and refinery terminals in the region, and
the biodiesel price determined after credits and incentives are subtracted at biodiesel plants in
the region. The commissioner shall report wholesale price differences to the governor who, after
consultation with the commissioners of commerce and agriculture, may by executive order adjust
the biodiesel mandate if a price disparity reported by the commissioner will cause economic
hardship to retailers of diesel fuel in this state. Any adjustment must be for a specified period of
time, after which the percentage of biodiesel fuel to be blended into diesel fuel returns to the amount
required in subdivision 2. The biodiesel mandate must not be adjusted to less than five percent.

   (b) The exemption in paragraph (a), clause (1), expires 30 days after the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has approved the use of biodiesel fuel in motors at electric generating plants under its
regulation.
    Subd. 4. Disclosure. A refinery or terminal shall provide, at the time diesel fuel is sold or
transferred from the refinery or terminal, a bill of lading or shipping manifest to the person who
receives the fuel. For biodiesel-blended products, the bill of lading or shipping manifest must
disclose biodiesel content, stating volume percentage, gallons of biodiesel per gallons of petroleum
diesel base-stock, or an ASTM "Bxx" designation where "xx" denotes the volume percent biodiesel
included in the blended product. This subdivision does not apply to sales or transfers of biodiesel
blend stock between refineries, between terminals, or between a refinery and a terminal.
    Subd. 5. Annual report. Beginning in 2009, the commissioner of agriculture must report by
January 15 of each year to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees
and divisions with jurisdiction over agriculture policy and finance regarding the implementation
of the minimum content requirements in subdivision 2, including information about the price and
supply of biodiesel fuel. The report must include any written comments received from members of
the biodiesel fuel task force by January 1 of that year designated by them for inclusion in the report.

The program shall provide for physical remodeling and accessibility accommodations of existing
single-family dwellings to enable frail older persons to remain in their current home. The program
shall also pay for general repairs when an accessibility modification makes the repair necessary.
The program must deliver services at the local level, include outreach and education to the target
population, and allow reasonable expenditures for materials and labor. The maximum amount of
assistance provided in any one household shall not exceed $10,000. The board, in consultation
with area agencies on aging and local services providers, shall establish cost-sharing arrangements
for program participants based on a sliding scale.

burden. Program services must be targeted to low and moderate-income caregivers of low and
moderate-income adults age 60 and older who do not qualify for or whose needs cannot be met
under other publicly funded programs. The board, in consultation with area agencies on aging and
local service providers, shall establish cost-sharing arrangements for program participants based on

    Subdivision 1. Establishment. (a) The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with
the commissioners of health and housing finance, shall develop and implement, beginning July 1,
2009, a three-year demonstration project for older adult services community consortiums. An older
adult services community consortium may consist of health care and social service providers, county
agencies, health plan companies, and other community stakeholders within a demonstration site that
have established a process for joint decision making. Demonstration sites may include a portion of
a county, an entire county, or multiple counties.
   (b) Each community consortium seeking to participate as a demonstration site must submit an
application to the commissioner. The application must include:
    (1) a description of the entities participating in the consortium, the scope of collaboration, and
the process to be used for joint-decision making;
   (2) the methods by which the consortium plans to achieve the goals specified in subdivision 2;
   (3) a description of the proposed demonstration site; and
   (4) other information the commissioner determines to be necessary to evaluate proposals.
   (c) The commissioner of human services shall establish a process to review and consider
applicants. The commissioner shall designate up to three community consortiums as demonstration
projects.
    (d) Each community consortium selected to participate shall establish a local group to assist in
planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating the coordinated service delivery system within
the demonstration site. Planning for each consortium shall build upon current planning processes
developed by county gaps analyses and Elder Care Development Partnerships under Minnesota
Statutes, section 256B.0917.
    Subd. 2. Goals. The community consortium demonstration projects are intended to accelerate
the development of community based services to fill in gaps identified within communities by using
a pool of funds and providing flexibility in the use and distribution of these funds within each
demonstration site. These projects must be designed to:
   (1) ensure consumer access to a continuum of older adult services;
    (2) create an adequate supply of affordable home-based alternatives to care for persons currently
using nursing facilities or likely to need nursing facility services in the future;
   (3) establish and achieve measurable performance targets for care delivered throughout the
continuum of care; and
    (4) support the management of chronic and complex conditions through greater coordination of
all services needed by older adults.

the consortiums are using technology as a part of their proposal. To the extent that the commissioner
of the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency funds projects to create or preserve affordable housing
options for older adults, the commissioner shall give priority to financially feasible projects
proposed or supported by community consortiums selected under subdivision 1. The commissioner
of transportation shall give priority to community consortiums selected under subdivision 1 when
distributing transportation-related funds to create transportation options for older adults.
    Subd. 4. Federal approval. The commissioner of human services shall request any federal
approvals or waivers necessary to implement the community consortiums under the medical
assistance program and include medical assistance funding as specified in subdivision 6 in the
community consortium account.
    Subd. 5. Quality measures. (a) Community consortiums participating in the demonstration
project shall report information to the commissioner of human services necessary to evaluate the
demonstration project, in the form and manner specified by the commissioners. The information
collected by the commissioner must include both process and outcome measures, including, but not
limited to, measures related to enrollee satisfaction, service delivery, service coordination, service
access, use of technology, individual outcomes, and costs.
   (b) Participating consortiums shall identify state policies that limit the extent to which project
goals can be achieved and recommend necessary changes to the appropriate state agencies.
    Subd. 6. Community consortium account; financing. (a) The commissioner of finance
shall establish a community consortium account as a special revenue account for the purpose of
collecting funds for distribution to the selected community consortiums. Funds must be collected
from the following existing grant programs within the Departments of Health and Human Services
and must be transferred as follows to the community consortium account prior to awarding of the
demonstration grants:

service grants under Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.0917, subdivision 13, and community
services development grants under Minnesota Statutes, section 256.9754, subdivision 3; and
     (3) ten percent of the funds appropriated for the biennium ending June 30, 2011, for nursing
facility performance grants under Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.434, subdivision 4, paragraph
(d).
    (b) Money in the community consortium account may be used by the commissioner of human
services to provide grants to participating community consortiums.
    (c) Funds available from closure of nursing facility beds within a demonstration site may be used
by the consortium to fund consortium-related activities if the closed beds have not been claimed as
a planned closure rate adjustment under Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.437.
    (d) The commissioner of health, in consultation with the commissioner of human services,
may approve moratorium exception projects that are part of the original applications submitted
by the participating consortiums, using any funding made available under paragraph (a), clause
(1), and subject to the limits of that funding. Nursing facilities receiving approval for moratorium

exception projects under this paragraph shall receive a rate increase calculated in the same manner
as facilities receiving exceptions under Minnesota Statutes, section 144A.073, and the rate increase
shall continue to apply after the expiration of the demonstration project grant under this section.
Once grants under this section are no longer made, any funds made available under paragraph
(a), clause (1), that are not being used by participating consortiums shall be transferred to the
Department of Health to be used for moratorium exception projects approved under Minnesota
Statutes, section 144A.073.
    Subd. 7. Evaluation and report. The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with
the commissioners of health and housing finance, shall evaluate the demonstration project, and
report findings and recommendations to the legislature by November 15, 2011, on whether the
demonstration project should be continued and whether the number of demonstration project sites
increased. The evaluation and report must include:
   (1) a comparison of the performance of demonstration sites relative to nonconsortium
communities on the quality measures specified in subdivision 5;
    (2) an assessment of the extent to which the demonstration project can be successfully expanded
to other parts of the state; and
    (3) legislative changes necessary to improve the effectiveness of the demonstration project and
to expand the projects to other parts of the state.

reforms;
   (7) increases or decreases in administrative expenses and health care expenses due to
coordination of care;
   (8) increases or decreases in up-front and long-term utilization due to access to comprehensive
medically necessary benefits, including dental care, mental health care, prescription drugs, and other
health care; and
    (9) nonhealth care impacts on state and local expenditures such as reduced out-of-home
placement or crime costs due to mental health or chemical dependency coverage.

permanently physically disabled minor, the owner may apply for and secure from the commissioner
(1) immediately, a temporary permit valid for 30 days if the applicant is eligible for the disability
plates issued under this section, and (2) two disability plates with attached emblems, one plate to
be attached to the front, and one to the rear of the motor vehicle.
    (b) The commissioner shall not issue more than one set of plates to any owner of a motor

    Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.446, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

    Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.67, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Trailer, semitrailer. (a) No trailer or semitrailer with a gross weight of 3,000 or more
pounds, or a gross weight that exceeds the empty weight of the towing vehicle, may be drawn on a

     (b) A child passenger restraint system is not required for a child who cannot, in the judgment of
a licensed physician, be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system because of a medical
condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.
    (c) A person offering a motor vehicle for rent or lease shall provide a child passenger restraint
device to a customer renting or leasing the motor vehicle who requests the device. A reasonable rent
or fee may be charged for use of the child passenger restraint device.

the movement of sugar beets, carrots, and potatoes from the field of harvest to the point of the first
unloading. Transfer of the product from a farm vehicle or small farm trailer, within the meaning of
chapter 168, to another vehicle is not considered to be the first unloading. A permit issued under
section 169.86, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), is required. The commissioner shall not issue permits
under this subdivision if to do so will result in a loss of federal highway funding to the state.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.86, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

    The commissioner of transportation, in cooperation with the Metropolitan Council and
representatives of counties, statutory and home rule charter cities, and towns, shall study the
benefits, feasibility, and cost of adopting a complete streets policy applicable to plans to construct,
reconstruct, and relocate streets and roads that includes the following elements:

for bicycle and pedestrian ways;
   (3) paved shoulders on rural roads;
   (4) safe pedestrian travel, including for people with disabilities, on sidewalks and street
crossings;
   (5) utilization of the latest and best design standards; and

   The commissioner shall report findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the senate

    (i) restoration of former trunk highways that have reverted to counties or to statutory or home
rule charter cities, or for trunk highways that will be restored and subsequently turned back by
agreement between the commissioner and the local road authority;
     (ii) safety improvements on county highways, municipal highways, streets, or town roads; and
     (iii) statewide routes of regional significance.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "restoration" means the level of effort required to improve
the route that will be turned back to an acceptable condition as determined by agreement made
between the commissioner and the county or city before the route is turned back.
    (c) The commissioner shall review the need for funds to restore highways that have been or will
be turned back. The commissioner shall determine, on a biennial basis, the percentage of funds in the
flexible highway account to be distributed to each district, and within each district the percentage
to be used for each of the purposes specified in paragraph (a), clause (2). Money in the account
may be used for safety improvements and routes of regional significance only after money is set

aside to restore the identified turnbacks. The commissioner shall make these determinations only
after meeting and holding discussions with committees selected by the statewide associations of
both county commissioners and municipal officials. The commissioner shall, to the extent feasible,
annually allocate 50 percent of the funds in the flexible highway account under paragraph (a), clause
(2), to the department's metropolitan district, and 50 percent to districts in greater Minnesota.
    (d) Money that will be used for the restoration of trunk highways that have reverted or that will
revert to cities must be deposited in the municipal turnback account, which is created in the state
treasury.
    (e) Money that will be used for the restoration of trunk highways that have reverted or that will
revert to counties must be deposited in the county turnback account, which is created in the state
treasury.
    (f) Money that will be used for safety improvements must be deposited in the highway safety
improvement account, which is created in the state treasury to be used as grants to statutory or home
rule charter cities, towns, and counties to assist in paying the costs of constructing or reconstructing
city streets, county highways, or town roads to reduce crashes, deaths, injuries, and property damage.
    (g) Money that will be used for statewide routes of regional significance must be deposited in
the statewide routes of regional significance account, which is created in the state treasury, and used
as grants to statutory or home rule charter cities, towns, and counties to assist in paying the costs
of constructing or reconstructing city streets, county highways, or town roads with statewide or
regional significance that have not been fully funded through other state, federal, or local funding
sources.
    (h) As part of each biennial budget submission to the legislature, the commissioner shall describe
how the money in the flexible highway account will be apportioned among the county turnback
account, the municipal turnback account, the trunk highway fund for routes turned back to local
governments by agreement, the highway safety improvement account, and the statewide routes of
regional significance account.

   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.081, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 4. Metropolitan routes of regional significance account. (a) For purposes of this
subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given them:
   (1) "metropolitan area" has the meaning given in section 473.121, subdivision 4; and
   (2) "population" has the meaning given in section 477A.011, subdivision 3, except that it
excludes the three most populous cities in the metropolitan area.
    (b) The metropolitan routes of regional significance account is created in the state treasury. Funds
in the account are for allocation to metropolitan counties to assist in paying the costs of construction,
reconstruction, or maintenance of county highways with statewide or regional significance that have
not been fully funded through other state, federal, or local funding sources.
    (c) The commissioner shall allocate funds in the account to counties in the metropolitan area so
that each county receives an amount proportional to the percentage that its population, estimated or
established by July 15 of the year prior to the current calendar year, bears to the total population of
the counties receiving funds under this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.081, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5. Excess sum. (a) For purposes of this section, "excess sum" means an amount calculated
by the commissioner as the sum of revenue within the flexible highway account:
    (1) attributed to that portion of the gasoline excise tax rate under section 296A.07, subdivision
3, in excess of 20 cents per gallon, and to that portion of the excise tax rates in excess of the
energy equivalent of a gasoline excise tax rate of 20 cents per gallon for E85 and M85 under section
296A.07, subdivision 3, and special fuel under section 296A.08, subdivision 2;
   (2) attributed to a change in the passenger vehicle registration tax under section 168.013,
imposed on or after July 1, 2008, that exceeds (i) the amount collected in fiscal year 2008,
multiplied by (ii) the annual average United States Consumer Price Index for the calendar year
previous to the current calendar year, divided by the annual average United States Consumer Price
Index for calendar year 2007; and
    (3) attributed to that portion of the motor vehicle sales tax revenue in excess of the percentage
allocated to the flexible highway account in fiscal year 2007.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, the United States Consumer Price Index identified in
paragraph (a), clause (2), is for all urban consumers, United States city average, as determined by
the United States Department of Labor.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009.
   Sec. 4. Laws 2008, chapter 152, article 1, section 6, is amended to read:
       Sec. 6. VALUE CAPTURE STUDY; APPROPRIATION.
    Subdivision 1. Findings. The legislature finds that large public investments in state
transportation infrastructure, such as constructing freeway interchanges, new highways, and rail
7652                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [91ST DAY

transit stations, can result in surrounding private land and other property increasing in value,
sometimes by substantial amounts. The special assessment law, Minnesota Statutes, chapter 429,
provides a method for local governments to use similar private or special benefits to help finance
local streets, roads, and other transportation improvements. However, the law does not provide the
state with a similar financing mechanism and the nature of a large state transportation project may
suggest that alternative financing mechanisms are more appropriate.
    Subd. 2. Appropriation; study. $325,000 is appropriated from the general fund to the Board of
Regents of the University of Minnesota for the Center for Transportation Studies to complete a study
to assess the public policy implications of financing new and improved transportation infrastructure
in Minnesota through capturing the value of the benefits created, to prepare a report on its findings,
and to conduct a series of workshops. This is a onetime appropriation and is available in fiscal years
2008 ­an
       ­d­, 2009, and 2010.
    Subd. 3. Report; workshops. The Center for Transportation Studies must report its preliminary
findings to the legislature by March 1, 2009, and must issue its full report by July 1, 2009. The Center
for Transportation must also offer a series of educational workshops for elected officials during the
summer and fall of 2009.
   Sec. 5. Laws 2008, chapter 152, article 2, section 1, is amended to read:
       Section 1. [296A.083] DEBT SERVICE SURCHARGE.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given them:
    (1) "debt service" means the amount of principal and interest in each fiscal year attributable to
the trunk highway bonds authorized in this article; and
   (2) "surcharge" means the rate imposed under this section on gasoline taxed under section
296A.07, subdivision 3, clause (3), and includes a proportional rate for each type of fuel taxed
under sections 296A.07, subdivision 3, clauses (1) and (2), and 296A.08, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 2. Debt service forecast. On June 30, 2008, and each March 1 thereafter, the
commissioner of finance shall report to the commissioner of revenue on trunk highway debt
service. The report must include the annual amount of revenue from the surcharge previously

necessary to pay the remaining debt service.
    Subd. 3. Surcharge rate. (a) By July 16, 2008, and each April 1 thereafter, the commissioner of
revenue shall calculate and publish a surcharge as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c). The surcharge
is imposed from August 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, and each new surcharge thereafter is
imposed the following July 1 through June 30.
    (b) For fiscal years 2009 through 2012, the commissioner shall set the surcharge as specified in
the following surcharge rate schedule.
        Surcharge Rate Schedule

2009                                  0.5
2010                                  2.1
2011                                  2.5
2012                                  3.0

    (c) For fiscal year 2013 and thereafter, the commissioner shall set the surcharge at the lesser of
(1) 3.5 cents, or (2) an amount calculated so that the total proceeds from the surcharge deposited in
the trunk highway fund from fiscal year 2009 to the upcoming fiscal year equals the total amount of
debt service from fiscal years 2009 to 2039, and the surcharge is rounded to the nearest 0.1 cent.
    Subd. 4. Surcharge administration. The audit, assessment, appeal, collection, enforcement,
penalty, interest, refund and administrative provisions that apply to the taxes in chapter 296A apply
to the surcharge imposed by this section. The surcharge is not to be used in calculating the credit in
section 296A.16, subdivision 5.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 6. Laws 2008, chapter 152, article 2, section 3, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
Subd. 2. State Road Construction                                                       1,717,694,000

(a)     For    the    actual   construction,
reconstruction, and improvement of trunk
highways, including design-build contracts
and consultant usage to support these
activities. This includes the cost of actual
payments to landowners for lands acquired
for highway rights-of-way, payments to
lessees, interest subsidies, and relocation
expenses. This appropriation is in the
following amounts:
(1) $417,694,000 in fiscal year 2009, and the
commissioner may use up to $71,008,000 of
this amount for program delivery;
(2) $500,000,000 in fiscal year 2010, and the
commissioner may use up to $85,000,000 of
this amount for program delivery; and
(3) $100,000,000 in each fiscal year for
fiscal years 2011 through 2018, and the
commissioner may use up to $17,000,000 of
the amount in each fiscal year for program
delivery.
(b) Of the amount in fiscal year 2009,
$40,000,000 is for construction of
interchanges and intersections involving
7654                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE   [91ST DAY

a trunk highway, where the interchange
or intersection will promote economic
development, increase employment, relieve
growing traffic congestion, and promote
traffic safety. The amount under this
paragraph must be allocated 50 percent to
the department's metropolitan district, and 50
percent to districts in greater Minnesota.
(c) Of the amount in fiscal years
2009 and 2010, the commissioner
shall use $300,000,000 each year for
predesign, design, preliminary engineering,
right-of-way     acquisition,     reasonable
approaches, construction, reconstruction,
and maintenance of bridges in the trunk
highway bridge improvement program under
Minnesota Statutes, section 165.14.
(d) Of the total appropriation under this
subdivision, the commissioner shall use at
least $50,000,000 for accelerating transit
facility improvements on or adjacent to trunk
highways.
(e) Of the total appropriation under this
subdivision provided to the Department of
Transportation's district 7, the commissioner
shall first expend funds as necessary to
accelerate all projects that (1) are on a trunk
highway classified as a medium priority
interregional corridor, (2) are included in the
district's long-range transportation plan, but
are not included in the state transportation
improvement program or the ten-year
highway work plan, and (3) expand capacity
from a two-lane highway to a freeway
or expressway, as defined in Minnesota
Statutes, section 160.02, subdivision 19. The
commissioner shall establish as the highest
priority under this paragraph any project
that currently has a final environmental
impact statement completed. The requirement
under this paragraph does not change the
department's funding allocation process

subject of a pardon, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record.
     (c) A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the
business screening agency reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, which may be based
on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed
record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous, the business screening service
shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons why it has determined that the dispute
is frivolous and provide a description of any information required to investigate the disputed record.

section is liable to the individual who is the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual
damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable
attorney fees.
    (b) A business screening service in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, United State Code, title 15, section 1681, et seq., is considered to be in compliance

actions would violate this section and federal law.

criminal record information in this state or that obtains a criminal record from a government entity,
as defined in section 13.02, or a court in this state is deemed to have consented to service of
process in this state for purposes of section 5.25, subdivision 4, or other applicable law and to the

disease.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 27. Statewide health information exchange. (a) The commissioner has the authority

information exchange that shall meet the following criteria:
   (1) the legal entity must meet all constitutional and statutory requirements to allow the
commissioner to participate; and
    (2) the commissioner or the commissioner's designated representative must have the right to
participate in the governance of the legal entity under the same terms and conditions and subject to
the same requirements as any other member in the legal entity and in that role shall act to advance
state interests and lessen the burdens of government.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 16C, the commissioner may pay the state's prorated share of
development-related expenses of the legal entity retroactively from October 29, 2007, regardless
of the date the commissioner joins the legal entity as a member.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.055, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Disabled children. (a) A person is eligible for medical assistance if the person is under
age 19 and qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section 1382c(a), and
would be eligible for medical assistance under the state plan if residing in a medical institution, and
the child requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities, for whom home care is appropriate, provided that the
cost to medical assistance under this section is not more than the amount that medical assistance
would pay for if the child resides in an institution. After the child is determined to be eligible under
this section, the commissioner shall review the child's disability under United States Code, title
42, section 1382c(a) and level of care defined under this section no more often than annually and
may elect, based on the recommendation of health care professionals under contract with the state
medical review team, to extend the review of disability and level of care up to a maximum of four
years. The commissioner's decision on the frequency of continuing review of disability and level of
care is not subject to administrative appeal under section 256.045. The county agency shall send a
notice of disability review to the enrollee six months prior to the date the recertification of disability
is due. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting other redeterminations of medical
assistance eligibility under this chapter and annual cost-effective reviews under this section.

    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means an institution as defined in section
144.696, subdivision 3, 144.55, subdivision 3, or Minnesota Rules, part 4640.3600, and licensed
pursuant to sections 144.50 to 144.58. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of
care provided in a hospital if the child is determined by the commissioner to need an extensive
array of health services, including mental health services, for an undetermined period of time,
whose health condition requires frequent monitoring and treatment by a health care professional
or by a person supervised by a health care professional, who would reside in a hospital or require
frequent hospitalization if these services were not provided, and the daily care needs are more
complex than a nursing facility level of care.
    A child with serious emotional disturbance requires a level of care provided in a hospital if
the commissioner determines that the individual requires 24-hour supervision because the person
exhibits recurrent or frequent suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, recurrent or frequent
psychosomatic disorders or somatopsychic disorders that may become life threatening, recurrent or
frequent severe socially unacceptable behavior associated with psychiatric disorder, ongoing and
chronic psychosis or severe, ongoing and chronic developmental problems requiring continuous
skilled observation, or severe disabling symptoms for which office-centered outpatient treatment is
not adequate, and which overall severely impact the individual's ability to function.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "nursing facility" means a facility which provides nursing
care as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, licensed pursuant to sections 144A.02 to 144A.10,
which is appropriate if a person is in active restorative treatment; is in need of special treatments
provided or supervised by a licensed nurse; or has unpredictable episodes of active disease processes
requiring immediate judgment by a licensed nurse. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires
the level of care provided in a nursing facility if the child is determined by the commissioner to meet
the requirements of the preadmission screening assessment document under section 256B.0911 and
the home care independent rating document under section 256B.0655, subdivision 4, clause (3),
adjusted to address age-appropriate standards for children age 18 and under, pursuant to section
256B.0655, subdivision 3.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities" or "ICF/MR" means a program licensed to provide services to persons with
developmental disabilities under section 252.28, and chapter 245A, and a physical plant licensed
as a supervised living facility under chapter 144, which together are certified by the Minnesota
Department of Health as meeting the standards in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part
483, for an intermediate care facility which provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities who require 24-hour supervision and active treatment for medical, behavioral, or
habilitation needs. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of care provided in an
ICF/MR if the commissioner finds that the child has a developmental disability in accordance with
section 256B.092, is in need of a 24-hour plan of care and active treatment similar to persons with
developmental disabilities, and there is a reasonable indication that the child will need ICF/MR
services.
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a person requires the level of care provided in a nursing
facility if the person requires 24-hour monitoring or supervision and a plan of mental health
treatment because of specific symptoms or functional impairments associated with a serious mental
illness or disorder diagnosis, which meet severity criteria for mental health established by the
commissioner and published in March 1997 as the Minnesota Mental Health Level of Care for

Children and Adolescents with Severe Emotional Disorders.
    (f) The determination of the level of care needed by the child shall be made by the commissioner
based on information supplied to the commissioner by the parent or guardian, the child's physician
or physicians, and other professionals as requested by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
establish a screening team to conduct the level of care determinations according to this subdivision.
    (g) If a child meets the conditions in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e), the commissioner must assess
the case to determine whether:
   (1) the child qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section
1382c(a), and would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a medical institution; and
    (2) the cost of medical assistance services for the child, if eligible under this subdivision, would
not be more than the cost to medical assistance if the child resides in a medical institution to be
determined as follows:
    (i) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the cost of care for the child
in an institution shall be determined using the average payment rate established for the regional
treatment centers that are certified as ICF's/MR;
    (ii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an inpatient hospital setting according to
paragraph (b), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3520,
items F and G; and
    (iii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in a nursing facility according to paragraph
(c) or (e), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3040,
except that the nursing facility average rate shall be adjusted to reflect rates which would be paid
for children under age 16. The commissioner may authorize an amount up to the amount medical
assistance would pay for a child referred to the commissioner by the preadmission screening team
under section 256B.0911.
    (h) Children eligible for medical assistance services under section 256B.055, subdivision 12, as
of June 30, 1995, must be screened according to the criteria in this subdivision prior to January 1,
1996. Children found to be ineligible may not be removed from the program until January 1, 1996.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256B.055, subdivision 14, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 14. Persons detained by law. (a) Medical assistance may be paid for an inmate of a
correctional facility who is conditionally released as authorized under section 241.26, 244.065, or
631.425, if the individual does not require the security of a public detention facility and is housed in
a halfway house or community correction center, or under house arrest and monitored by electronic
surveillance in a residence approved by the commissioner of corrections, and if the individual meets
the other eligibility requirements of this chapter.
    (b) An individual who is enrolled in medical assistance, and who is charged with a crime and
incarcerated for less than 12 months shall be suspended from eligibility at the time of incarceration
until the individual is released. Upon release, medical assistance eligibility is reinstated without
reapplication using a reinstatement process and form, if the individual is otherwise eligible.

       Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.056, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Home equity limit for medical assistance payment of long-term care services. (a)
Effective for requests of medical assistance payment of long-term care services filed on or after July
1, 2006, and for renewals on or after July 1, 2006, for persons who received payment of long-term
care services under a request filed on or after January 1, 2006, the equity interest in the home of a
person whose eligibility for long-term care services is determined on or after January 1, 2006, shall
not exceed $500,000, unless it is the lawful residence of the person's spouse or child who is under
age 21, or a child of any age who is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in the
7686                                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                          [91ST DAY

Supplemental Security Income program. The amount specified in this paragraph shall be increased
beginning in year 2011, from year to year based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price
Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average), rounded to the nearest $1,000.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, a "home" means any real or personal property interest,
including an interest in an agricultural homestead as defined under section 273.124, subdivision
1, that, at the time of the request for medical assistance payment of long-term care services, is the
primary dwelling of the person or was the primary dwelling of the person before receipt of long-term
care services began outside of the home.
    (c) A person denied or terminated from medical assistance payment of long-term care services
because the person's home equity exceeds the home equity limit may seek a waiver based upon a
hardship by filing a written request with the county agency. Hardship is an imminent threat to the
person's health and well-being that is demonstrated by documentation of no alternatives for payment
of long-term care services. The county agency shall make a decision regarding the written request
to waive the home equity limit within 30 days if all necessary information has been provided. The
county agency shall send the person and the person's representative a written notice of decision on
the request for a demonstrated hardship waiver that also advises the person of appeal rights under
the fair hearing process of section 256.045.

annuity or other similar financial instrument or a change in the state's preferred remainder beneficiary
designation under the annuity or other similar financial instrument occurs. The county agency shall
provide the issuer with the name, address, and telephone number of a unit within the department
that the issuer can contact to comply with this paragraph.
    (d) "Preferred remainder beneficiary" for purposes of this subdivision and sections 256B.0594
and 256B.0595 means the state is a remainder beneficiary in the first position in an amount equal
to the amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the institutionalized person, or is a remainder
beneficiary in the second position if the institutionalized person designates and is survived by a
remainder beneficiary who is (1) a spouse who does not reside in a medical institution, (2) a minor
child, or (3) a child of any age who is blind or permanently and totally disabled as defined in the
Supplemental Security Income program. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the state is the remainder
beneficiary in the first position if the spouse or child disposes of the remainder for less than fair
market value.
   (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "institutionalized person" and "long-term care services"
have the meanings given in section 256B.0595, subdivision 1, paragraph (h).
    (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "medical institution" means a skilled nursing facility,
intermediate care facility, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
nursing facility, or inpatient hospital.

program payment of long-term care services by an individual who meets the requirements described
in subdivision 8, the commissioner shall determine the individual's eligibility for medical assistance

    (b) After determining assets subject to the asset limit under section 256B.056, subdivision 3
or 3c, or 256B.057, subdivision 9 or 10, the commissioner shall allow the individual to designate
assets to be protected from recovery under subdivisions 13 and 15 up to the dollar amount of the
benefits utilized under the partnership policy. Designated assets shall be disregarded for purposes
of determining eligibility for payment of long-term care services.
    (c) The individual shall identify the designated assets and the full fair market value of those
assets and designate them as assets to be protected at the time of initial application for medical
assistance. The full fair market value of real property or interests in real property shall be based
on the most recent full assessed value for property tax purposes for the real property, unless the
individual provides a complete professional appraisal by a licensed appraiser to establish the full
fair market value. The extent of a life estate in real property shall be determined using the life
estate table in the health care program's manual. Ownership of any asset in joint tenancy shall be
treated as ownership as tenants in common for purposes of its designation as a disregarded asset.
The unprotected value of any protected asset is subject to estate recovery according to subdivisions
13 and 15.
    (d) The right to designate assets to be protected is personal to the individual and ends when
the individual dies, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions 13 and 15. It does not include the
increase in the value of the protected asset and the income, dividends, or profits from the asset. It
may be exercised by the individual or by anyone with the legal authority to do so on the individual's
behalf. It shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, or given away.
    (e) If the dollar amount of the benefits utilized under a partnership policy is greater than the
full fair market value of all assets protected at the time of the application for medical assistance
long-term care services, the individual may designate additional assets that become available during
the individual's lifetime for protection under this section. The individual must make the designation

spouse as a monthly income allowance for the community spouse. Beginning with the first full
calendar month the institutionalized spouse is in the institution, the monthly income allowance is
not considered available to the institutionalized spouse for monthly payment of costs of care in the
institution as long as the income is made available to the community spouse.
   (b) The monthly income allowance is the amount by which the community spouse's monthly
maintenance needs allowance under paragraphs (c) and (d) exceeds the amount of monthly income
otherwise available to the community spouse.
    (c) The community spouse's monthly maintenance needs allowance is the lesser of $1,500 or
122 percent of the monthly federal poverty guideline for a family of two plus an excess shelter
allowance. The excess shelter allowance is for the amount of shelter expenses that exceed 30 percent
of 122 percent of the federal poverty guideline line for a family of two. Shelter expenses are the
community spouse's expenses for rent, mortgage payments including principal and interest, taxes,
insurance, required maintenance charges for a cooperative or condominium that is the community
spouse's principal residence, and the standard utility allowance under section 5(e) of the federal Food
Stamp Act of 1977. If the community spouse has a required maintenance charge for a cooperative
or condominium, the standard utility allowance must be reduced by the amount of utility expenses
included in the required maintenance charge.
    If the community or institutionalized spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
income greater than the monthly maintenance needs allowance determined in this paragraph due to
exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, the monthly maintenance needs
allowance may be increased to an amount that provides needed additional income.
    (d) The percentage of the federal poverty guideline used to determine the monthly maintenance
needs allowance in paragraph (c) is increased to 133 percent on July 1, 1991, and to 150 percent
on July 1, 1992. Adjustments in the income limits due to annual changes in the federal poverty
guidelines shall be implemented the first day of July following publication of the annual changes.
The $1,500 maximum must be adjusted January 1, 1990, and every January 1 after that by the same
percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (all items; United States
city average) between the two previous Septembers.
   (e) If a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for monthly income for
support of the community spouse, the community spouse's monthly income allowance under this
subdivision shall not be less than the amount of the monthly income ordered.
    Subd. 3. Family allowance. (a) A family allowance determined under paragraph (b) is not
considered available to the institutionalized spouse for monthly payment of costs of care in the
institution.
   (b) The family allowance is equal to one-third of the amount by which 122 percent of the monthly
federal poverty guideline for a family of two exceeds the monthly income for that family member.
   (c) For purposes of this subdivision, the term family member only includes a minor or
dependent child as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, dependent parent, or dependent sibling

of the institutionalized or community spouse if the sibling resides with the community spouse.
   (d) The percentage of the federal poverty guideline used to determine the family allowance in
paragraph (b) is increased to 133 percent on July 1, 1991, and to 150 percent on July 1, 1992.
Adjustments in the income limits due to annual changes in the federal poverty guidelines shall be
implemented the first day of July following publication of the annual changes.
    Subd. 4. Treatment of income. (a) No income of the community spouse will be considered
available to an eligible institutionalized spouse, beginning the first full calendar month of
institutionalization, except as provided in this subdivision.
    (b) In determining the income of an institutionalized spouse or community spouse, after the
institutionalized spouse has been determined eligible for medical assistance, the following rules
apply.
   (1) For income that is not from a trust, availability is determined according to items (i) to (v),
unless the instrument providing the income otherwise specifically provides:
    (i) if payment is made solely in the name of one spouse, the income is considered available only
to that spouse;
   (ii) if payment is made in the names of both spouses, one-half of the income is considered
available to each;
   (iii) if payment is made in the names of one or both spouses together with one or more other
persons, the income is considered available to each spouse according to the spouse's interest, or
one-half of the joint interest is considered available to each spouse if each spouse's interest is not
specified;
   (iv) if there is no instrument that establishes ownership, one-half of the income is considered
available to each spouse; and
   (v) either spouse may rebut the determination of availability of income by showing by a
preponderance of the evidence that ownership interests are different than provided above.
    (2) For income from a trust, income is considered available to each spouse as provided in the
trust. If the trust does not specify an amount available to either or both spouses, availability will be
determined according to items (i) to (iii):
    (i) if payment of income is made only to one spouse, the income is considered available only to
that spouse;
   (ii) if payment of income is made to both spouses, one-half is considered available to each; and
   (iii) if payment is made to either or both spouses and one or more other persons, the income is
considered available to each spouse in proportion to each spouse's interest, or if no such interest is
specified, one-half of the joint interest is considered available to each spouse.

any time after the date of institutionalization if the person has been determined eligible for medical
assistance, or within 30 months before or any time after the date of the first approved application
for medical assistance if the person has not yet been determined eligible for medical assistance, the

are provided in a swing bed, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities,
and home and community-based services provided pursuant to sections 256B.0915, 256B.092, and
256B.49. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 2, 3, and 4, "institutionalized person"
includes a person who is an inpatient in a nursing facility or in a swing bed, or intermediate care

    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0595, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Period of ineligibility. (a) For any uncompensated transfer occurring on or before
August 10, 1993, the number of months of ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the lesser
of 30 months, or the uncompensated transfer amount divided by the average medical assistance
rate for nursing facility services in the state in effect on the date of application. The amount used
to calculate the average medical assistance payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect
payment rates for the previous calendar year. The period of ineligibility begins with the month
in which the assets were transferred. If the transfer was not reported to the local agency at the
time of application, and the applicant received long-term care services during what would have
been the period of ineligibility if the transfer had been reported, a cause of action exists against
the transferee for the cost of long-term care services provided during the period of ineligibility, or
for the uncompensated amount of the transfer, whichever is less. T                 ­h­­e­­­

uncompensated transfer amount is the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away,
sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received.
     (b) For uncompensated transfers made after August 10, 1993, the number of months of
ineligibility for long-term care services shall be the total uncompensated value of the resources
transferred divided by the average medical assistance rate for nursing facility services in the state
in effect on the date of application. The amount used to calculate the average medical assistance
payment rate shall be adjusted each July 1 to reflect payment rates for the previous calendar year.
The period of ineligibility begins with the first day of the month after the month in which the assets
were transferred except that if one or more uncompensated transfers are made during a period
of ineligibility, the total assets transferred during the ineligibility period shall be combined and
a penalty period calculated to begin on the first day of the month after the month in which the
first uncompensated transfer was made. If the transfer was reported to the local agency after the
date that advance notice of a period of ineligibility that affects the next month could be provided

fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of
compensation received. Effective for transfers made on or after March 1, 1996, involving persons
who apply for medical assistance on or after April 13, 1996, no cause of action exists for a transfer
unless:
    (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was a resident of a long-term care facility or was receiving that level of care in the community at
the time of the transfer;
   (2) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made to assist the
person to qualify for or retain medical assistance eligibility; or
    (3) the transferee actively solicited the transfer with intent to assist the person to qualify for or
retain eligibility for medical assistance.

services shall be reduced in an amount equal to the fraction.
    (e) In the case of multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than one month for less than

became an institutionalized person, and who provided care to the individual that, as certified by
the individual's attending physician, permitted the individual to reside at home rather than receive
care in an institution or facility;
    (2) a satisfactory showing is made that the individual intended to dispose of the homestead at
fair market value or for other valuable consideration; or
    (3) the local agency grants a waiver of a penalty resulting from a transfer for less than fair
market value because denial of eligibility would cause undue hardship for the individual, based
on imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. Whenever an applicant or recipient is
denied eligibility because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the local agency shall notify the
applicant or recipient that the applicant or recipient may request a waiver of the penalty if the denial
of eligibility will cause undue hardship. With the written consent of the individual or the personal
representative of the individual, a long-term care facility in which an individual is residing may file
an undue hardship waiver request, on behalf of the individual who is denied eligibility for long-term
care services on or after July 1, 2006, due to a period of ineligibility resulting from a transfer on
or after February 8, 2006. In evaluating a waiver, the local agency shall take into account whether
the individual was the victim of financial exploitation, whether the individual has made reasonable
efforts to recover the transferred property or resource, and other factors relevant to a determination
of hardship. If the local agency does not approve a hardship waiver, the local agency shall issue a
written notice to the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the
local agency's decision.
   (b) When a waiver is granted under paragraph (a), clause (3), a cause of action exists against the

   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0595, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Other exceptions to transfer prohibition. An institutionalized person who has made,
or whose spouse has made a transfer prohibited by subdivision 1, is not ineligible for long-term care
services if one of the following conditions applies:
   (1) the assets were transferred to the individual's spouse or to another for the sole benefit of the
spouse; or
    (2) the institutionalized spouse, prior to being institutionalized, transferred assets to a spouse,
provided that the spouse to whom the assets were transferred does not then transfer those assets to
another person for less than fair market value. (At the time when one spouse is institutionalized,
assets must be allocated between the spouses as provided under section 256B.059); or
    (3) the assets were transferred to the individual's child who is blind or permanently and totally
disabled as determined in the supplemental security income program; or
    (4) a satisfactory showing is made that the individual intended to dispose of the assets either at
fair market value or for other valuable consideration; or
    (5) the local agency determines that denial of eligibility for long-term care services would
work an undue hardship and grants a waiver of a penalty resulting from a transfer for less than fair
market value based on an imminent threat to the individual's health and well-being. Whenever an
applicant or recipient is denied eligibility because of a transfer for less than fair market value, the
local agency shall notify the applicant or recipient that the applicant or recipient may request a
waiver of the penalty if the denial of eligibility will cause undue hardship. With the written consent
of the individual or the personal representative of the individual, a long-term care facility in which
an individual is residing may file an undue hardship waiver request, on behalf of the individual
who is denied eligibility for long-term care services on or after July 1, 2006, due to a period of
ineligibility resulting from a transfer on or after February 8, 2006. In evaluating a waiver, the local
agency shall take into account whether the individual was the victim of financial exploitation,
whether the individual has made reasonable efforts to recover the transferred property or resource,
whether the individual has taken any action to prevent the designation of the department as a
remainder beneficiary on an annuity as described in section 256B.056, subdivision 11, and other
factors relevant to a determination of hardship. The local agency shall make a determination within
30 days of the receipt of all necessary information needed to make such a determination. If the
local agency does not approve a hardship waiver, the local agency shall issue a written notice to
the individual stating the reasons for the denial and the process for appealing the local agency's
decision. When a waiver is granted, a cause of action exists against the person to whom the assets
were transferred for that portion of long-term care services ­  g­ n­e

   (i) 30 months of a transfer made on or before August 10, 1993;
   (ii) 60 months of a transfer if the assets were transferred after August 30, 1993, to a trust or
portion of a trust that is considered a transfer of assets under federal law;
    (iii) 36 months of a transfer if transferred in any other manner after August 10, 1993, but prior
to February 8, 2006; or
   (iv) 60 months of any transfer made on or after February 8, 2006,

   Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0595, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 8. Cause of action; transfer prior to death. (a) A cause of action exists against a
transferee who receives assets for less than fair market value, either:
    (1) from a person who was a recipient of medical assistance and who made an uncompensated
transfer that was known to the county agency but a penalty period could not be implemented under
this section due to the death of the person; or
    (2) from a person who was a recipient of medical assistance who made an uncompensated
transfer that was not known to the county agency and the transfer was made with the intent to hinder,
delay, or defraud the state or local agency from recovering as allowed under section 256B.15. In
determining intent under this clause consideration may be given, among other factors, to whether:
     (i) the transfer was to a family member;
     (ii) the transferor retained possession or control of the property after the transfer;
     (iii) the transfer was concealed;
     (iv) the transfer included the majority of the transferor's assets;
    (v) the value of the consideration received was not reasonably equivalent to the fair market value
of the property; and
     (vi) the transfer occurred shortly before the death of the transferor.
     (b) No cause of action exists under this subdivision unless:
   (1) the transferee knew or should have known that the transfer was being made by a person who
was receiving medical assistance as described in section 256B.15, subdivision 1, paragraph (b); and
    (2) the transferee received the asset without providing a reasonable equivalent fair market value
in exchange for the transfer.
    (c) The cause of action is for the uncompensated amount of the transfer or the amount of medical
assistance paid on behalf of the person, whichever is less. The uncompensated transfer amount is
the fair market value of the asset at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount
of the compensation received.

    Subd. 4. Other survivors. (a) If the decedent who was single or the surviving spouse of a married
couple is survived by one of the following persons, a claim exists against the estate payable first from
the value of the nonhomestead property included in the estate and the personal representative shall
make, execute, and deliver to the county agency a lien against the homestead property in the estate
for any unpaid balance of the claim to the claimant as provided under this section:

     ­­) (2) a son or daughter or a grandchild who resided in the decedent medical assistance
recipient's home for at least two years immediately before the parent's or grandparent's
institutionalization and continuously since the date of institutionalization, and who establishes
by a preponderance of the evidence having provided care to the parent or grandparent who
received medical assistance, that the care was provided before institutionalization, and that the care
permitted the parent or grandparent to reside at home rather than in an institution.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "institutionalization" means receiving care: (1) in a nursing
facility or swing bed, or intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities; or
(2) through home and community-based services under section 256B.0915, 256B.092, or 256B.49.

    (1) shall authorize and arrange for the provision of all needed health services including but
not limited to the full range of services listed in sections 256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625
in order to ensure appropriate health care is delivered to enrollees; notwithstanding section
256B.0621, demonstration providers that provide nursing home and community-based services
under this section shall provide relocation service coordination to enrolled persons age 65 and over;
    (2) shall accept the prospective, per capita payment from the commissioner in return for the
provision of comprehensive and coordinated health care services for eligible individuals enrolled in
the program;
   (3) may contract with other health care and social service practitioners to provide services to
enrollees; and
   (4) shall institute recipient grievance procedures according to the method established by the
project, utilizing applicable requirements of chapter 62D. Disputes not resolved through this process
shall be appealable to the commissioner as provided in subdivision 11.
    (b) Demonstration providers must comply with the standards for claims settlement under section

    (f) For applications received on or after October 1, 2003, eligibility may begin no earlier
than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),
a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.

Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (i) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (j) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
    (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the

first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the United States
Citizenship and Immigration Services.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 524.3-803, is amended to read:

1989, whether or not notice to creditors has been published or served under section 524.3-801,
provided, however, that in the case of a decedent who died before June 16, 1989, no claim which
was then barred by any provision of law may be deemed to have been revived by the amendment
of this section. Claims authorized by section 246.53, 256B.15, or 256D.16 must not be barred after
one year as provided in this clause.
    (b) All claims against a decedent's estate which arise at or after the death of the decedent,

    (3) the presentment and payment at any time within one year after the decedent's death of any
claim arising before the death of the decedent that is referred to in section 524.3-715, clause (18),

   (4) the presentment and payment at any time before a petition is filed in compliance with section
524.3-1001 or 524.3-1002 or a closing statement is filed under section 524.3-1003, of:
   (i) any claim arising after the death of the decedent that is referred to in section 524.3-715, clause
(18), although the same may be otherwise barred hereunder;
    (ii) any other claim, including claims subject to clause (3), which would otherwise be barred

    (g) "Phased project" means a proposal that identifies construction occurring with more than one
distinct completion date. To be considered a distinct completion, each phase must have construction
that is ready for resident use, as determined by the commissioner, that is not dependent on similar
commissioner approval for future phases of construction. The commissioner of human services
shall only allow rate adjustments for construction projects in phases if the proposal from a facility
identifies construction in phases and each phase can be approved for use independent of the other
phases.
      Subd. 2. Request for proposals. At the authorization by the legislature of additional medical
assistance expenditures for exceptions to the moratorium on nursing homes, the commissioner
shall publish in the State Register a request for proposals for nursing home and certified boarding

    Subd. 4. Criteria for review. The following criteria shall be used in a consistent manner to
compare, evaluate, and rank all proposals submitted. Except for the criteria specified in clause (3),
the application of criteria listed under this subdivision shall not reflect any distinction based on the
geographic location of the proposed project:
    (1) the extent to which the proposal furthers state long-term care goals, including the goal of
enhancing the availability and use of alternative care services and the goal of reducing the number
of long-term care resident rooms with more than two beds;
   (2) the proposal's long-term effects on state costs including the cost estimate of the project
according to section 144A.071, subdivision 5a;
    (3) the extent to which the proposal promotes equitable access to long-term care services in
nursing homes through redistribution of the nursing home bed supply, as measured by the number of
beds relative to the population 85 or older,   ­­p
