    Municipalities other than the state having an agreement with the commissioner for code
administration and enforcement service for public buildings and state licensed facilities shall
charge their customary fees, including surcharge, to be paid directly to the jurisdiction by the
applicant seeking authorization to construct a public building or a state licensed facility. The
commissioner shall sign an agreement with a municipality other than the state for plan review, code
administration, and code enforcement service for public buildings and state licensed facilities in
the jurisdiction if the building officials of the municipality meet the requirements of section 16B.65
and wish to provide those services and if the commissioner determines that the municipality has
enough adequately trained and qualified building inspectors to provide those services for the
construction project.
    The commissioner may direct the state building official to assist a community that has been
affected by a natural disaster with building evaluation and other activities related to building codes.
    Administration and enforcement in a municipality under this section must apply any optional
provisions of the State Building Code adopted by the municipality. A municipality adopting any
optional code provision shall notify the state building official within 30 days of its adoption.
    The commissioner shall administer and enforce the provisions of the code relating to elevators
statewide, except as provided for under section 16B.747, subdivision 3.

official to administer the code. A municipality may designate no more than one building official
responsible for code administration defined by each certification category established in rule. Two
or more municipalities may combine in the designation of a building official for the purpose of
administering the provisions of the code within their communities. In those municipalities for
which no building officials have been designated, the state building official may use whichever state
employees are necessary to perform the duties of the building official until the municipality makes
a temporary or permanent designation. All costs incurred by virtue of these services rendered by
state employees must be borne by the involved municipality and receipts arising from these services
must be paid ­n

graduated schedule of administrative actions for violations of sections 16B.59 to 16B.75 and rules
adopted under those sections. The schedule must be based on and reflect the culpability, frequency,
and severity of the violator's actions. The commissioner may impose a penalty from the schedule
on a certification holder for a violation of sections 16B.59 to 16B.75 and rules adopted under
those sections. The penalty is in addition to any criminal penalty imposed for the same violation.

buildings or other improvements and these improvements will provide a substantial increase in the
property tax base within a reasonable period of time or the site will be used for an important publicly
owned or tax-exempt facility.
      Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.555, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Priorities. (a) The legislature expects that applications for grants will exceed the
available appropriations and the agency will be able to provide grants to only some of the applicant
development authorities.
    (b) If applications for grants for qualified sites exceed the available appropriations, the agency
shall make grants for sites that, in the commissioner's judgment, provide the highest return in public
benefits for the public costs incurred and that meet all the requirements provided by law. In making
this judgment, the commissioner shall consider the following factors:
    (1) the recommendations or ranking of projects by the commissioner of the Pollution Control
Agency regarding the potential threat to public health and the environment that would be reduced
or eliminated by completion of each of the response action plans;
    (2) the potential increase in the property tax base of the local taxing jurisdictions, considered
relative to the fiscal needs of the jurisdictions, that will result from developments that will occur
because of completion of each of the response action plans;
    (3) the social value to the community of the cleanup and redevelopment of the site, including
the importance of development of the proposed public facilities on each of the sites;
    (4) the probability that each site will be cleaned up without use of government money in the
reasonably foreseeable future by considering but not limited to the current market value of the site
versus the cleanup cost;
      (5) the amount of cleanup costs for each site; and
   (6) the amount of the commitment of municipal or other local resources to pay for the cleanup
costs.
    The factors are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather the commissioner may weigh each
factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner considers appropriate. The

commissioner may consider other factors that affect the net return of public benefits for completion
of the response action plan. The commissioner, notwithstanding the listing of priorities and the goal
of maximizing the return of public benefits, shall make grants that distribute available money to
sites both within and outside of the metropolitan area. The commissioner shall provide a written
statement of the supporting reasons for each grant. Unless sufficient applications are not received
for qualifying sites outside of the metropolitan area, at least 25 percent of the money provided as
grants must be made for sites located outside of the metropolitan area.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.575, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Commissioner discretion. The commissioner may make a grant for up to 50
percent of the eligible costs of a project. The determination of whether to make a grant for a site is
within the discretion of the commissioner, subject to this section and sections 116J.571 to 116J.574
and available unencumbered money in the redevelopment account. ­                            I­

commissioner's decisions and application of the priorities under this section are not subject to
judicial review, except for abuse of discretion.
     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116J.575, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Priorities. (a) If applications for grants exceed the available appropriations, grants
shall be made for sites that, in the commissioner's judgment, provide the highest return in
public benefits for the public costs incurred. "Public benefits" include job creation, bioscience
development, environmental benefits to the state and region, efficient use of public transportation,
efficient use of existing infrastructure, provision of affordable housing, multiuse development
that constitutes community rebuilding rather than single-use development, crime reduction, blight
reduction, community stabilization, and property tax base maintenance or improvement. In making
this judgment, the commissioner shall give priority to redevelopment projects with one or more
of the following characteristics:
     (1) the need for redevelopment in conjunction with contamination remediation needs;
   (2) the redevelopment project meets current tax increment financing requirements for a
redevelopment district and tax increments will contribute to the project;
     (3) the redevelopment potential within the municipality;
     (4) proximity to public transit if located in the metropolitan area; ­
                                                                          an

     (5) redevelopment costs related to expansion of a bioscience business in Minnesota; and
    ­
    (5
     ­­) (6) multijurisdictional projects that take into account the need for affordable housing,
transportation, and environmental impact.
     (b) The factors in paragraph (a) are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather, the commissioner
may weigh each factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner
considers appropriate. The commissioner may consider other factors that affect the net return of
public benefits for completion of the redevelopment plan. The commissioner, notwithstanding the
listing of priorities and the goal of maximizing the return of public benefits, shall make grants
that distribute available money to sites both within and outside of the metropolitan area. Unless

    (8) provide Minnesota businesses with international trade leads and information about the
availability and sources of services relating to international trade, such as export financing,
licensing, freight forwarding, international advertising, translation, and custom brokering;
    (9) locate, attract, and promote foreign direct investment and business development in Minnesota
to enhance employment opportunities in Minnesota;

diplomatic corps in Minnesota.

   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116L.04, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Pathways program. The pathways program may provide grants-in-aid for developing
programs which assist in the transition of persons from welfare to work and assist individuals at or
below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The program is to be operated by the board. The

documented according to requirements of the corporation.

   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 182.65, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature finds that the burden on employers
and employees of this state resulting from personal injuries and illnesses arising out of work
situations is substantial; that the prevention of these injuries and illnesses is an important objective
of the government of this state; that the greatest hope of attaining this objective lies in programs of
research and education, and in the earnest cooperation of government, employers and employees;
and that a program of regulation and enforcement is a necessary supplement to these more basic
programs.
    The legislature declares it to be its purpose and policy through the exercise of its powers to assure
so far as possible every worker in the state of Minnesota safe and healthful working conditions and
to preserve our human resources by:
    (a) authorizing the Occupational Safety and Health Advisory Council to advise, consult with
or recommend on any matters relating to the Minnesota occupational safety and health plan to the
commissioner of labor and industry and by authorizing the commissioner of labor and industry to
promulgate and enforce mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to employers
and employees in the state of Minnesota;
   (b) encouraging employers and employees to increase their efforts to reduce the number of
occupational safety and health hazards at their places of employment, and to stimulate employers
and employees to institute new and to perfect existing programs for providing safe and healthful
working conditions;

psychological factors involved, and by developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches
for dealing with occupational safety and health problems;
    (e) exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases
and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems,
in recognition of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from
those involved in occupational safety;
   (f) utilizing advances already made by federal laws and regulations providing safe and healthful
working conditions;
   (g) providing criteria which will assure insofar as practicable that no employee will suffer
diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of work experience;
    (h) providing an effective enforcement program which shall include locating enforcement
personnel in areas of the state with a higher incidence of workplace fatalities, injuries, and
complaints and a prohibition against giving advance notice of an inspection and sanctions for any
individual violating this prohibition;
    (i) providing for appropriate reporting procedures with respect to occupational safety and health,
which procedures will help achieve the objectives of this chapter and accurately describe the nature
of the occupational safety and health problem;
  (j) encouraging joint labor-management efforts to reduce injuries and diseases arising out of
employment;
    (k) providing consultation to employees and employers which will aid them in complying with
their responsibilities under this chapter where such consultation does not interfere with the effective
enforcement of this chapter; and
    (l) providing for training programs to increase the number and competence of personnel engaged
in the field of occupational safety and health.

      Sec. 25. [182.6553] SAFE PATIENT HANDLING PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Safe patient handling program required. (a) By July 1, 2008, every licensed
health care facility in the state shall adopt a written safe patient handling policy establishing the
facility's plan to achieve by January 1, 2011, the goal of minimizing manual lifting of patients by
nurses and other direct patient care workers by utilizing safe patient handling equipment.
      (b) The program shall address:
      (1) assessment of hazards with regard to patient handling;
      (2) the acquisition of an adequate supply of appropriate safe patient handling equipment;
   (3) initial and ongoing training of nurses and other direct patient care workers on the use of this
equipment;
   (4) procedures to ensure that physical plant modifications and major construction projects are
consistent with program goals; and
      (5) periodic evaluations of the safe patient handling program.
    Subd. 2. Safe patient handling committee. (a) By July 1, 2008, every licensed health care
facility in the state shall establish a safe patient handling committee either by creating a new
committee or assigning the functions of a safe patient handling committee to an existing committee.
    (b) Membership of a safe patient handling committee or an existing committee must meet the
following requirements:
      (1) at least half the members shall be nonmanagerial nurses and other direct patient care workers;
and
    (2) in a health care facility where nurses and other direct patient care workers are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement, the union shall select the committee members proportionate to its
representation of nonmanagerial workers, nurses, and other direct patient care workers.
   (c) A health care organization with more than one covered health care facility may establish
a committee at each facility or one committee to serve this function for all the facilities. If the
organization chooses to have one overall committee for multiple facilities, at least half of the
members of the overall committee must be nonmanagerial nurses and other direct patient care
workers and each facility must be represented on the committee.
  (d) Employees who serve on a safe patient handling committee must be compensated by their
employer for all hours spent on committee business.

   Subd. 3. Facilities with existing programs. A facility that has already adopted a safe patient
handling policy that satisfies the requirements of subdivision 1, and established a safe patient
handling committee by July 1, 2008, is considered to be in compliance with those requirements.
The committee must continue to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 2, paragraph (b), on an
ongoing basis.
   Subd. 4. Committee duties. A safe patient handling committee shall:
   (1) complete a patient handling hazard assessment that:
   (i) considers patient handling tasks, types of nursing units, patient populations, and the physical
environment of patient care areas;
   (ii) identifies problems and solutions;
   (iii) identifies areas of highest risk for lifting injuries; and
   (iv) recommends a mechanism to report, track, and analyze injury trends;
   (2) make recommendations on the purchase, use, and maintenance of an adequate supply of
appropriate safe patient handling equipment;
    (3) make recommendations on training of nurses and other direct patient care workers on use of
safe patient handling equipment, initially when the equipment arrives at the facility and periodically
afterwards;
   (4) conduct annual evaluations of the safe patient handling implementation plan and progress
toward goals established in the safe patient handling policy; and
   (5) recommend procedures to ensure that, when remodeling of patient care areas occurs, the
plans incorporate safe patient handling equipment or the physical space and construction design
needed to accommodate safe patient handling equipment at a later date.
   Subd. 5. Training materials. The commissioner shall make training materials on
implementation of this section available to all health care facilities at no cost as part of the training
and education duties of the commissioner under section 182.673.
   Subd. 6. Enforcement. This section shall be enforced by the commissioner under section
182.661. A violation of this section is subject to the penalties provided under section 182.666.
    Subd. 7. Grant program. The commissioner may make grants to health care facilities to
acquire safe patient handling equipment and for training on safe patient handling and safe patient
handling equipment. Grants to any one facility may not exceed $40,000. A grant must be matched
on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the grantee. The commissioner shall establish a grant application
process. The commissioner may give priority for grants to facilities that demonstrate that acquiring
safe patient handling equipment will impose a financial hardship on the facility. For health care
facilities that provide evidence of hardship, the commissioner may waive the 50 percent match
requirement and may grant such a facility more than $40,000. Health care facilities that the
commissioner determines are experiencing hardship shall not be required to meet the safe patient
handling requirements until July 1, 2012.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.085, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

    Subd. 3. Payments that delay unemployment benefits. (a) An applicant shall not be eligible
to receive unemployment benefits for any week with respect to which the applicant is receiving, has
received, or has filed for payment, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, in the form of:
   (1) vacation pay paid upon temporary, indefinite, or seasonal separation. This clause shall not
apply to vacation pay paid upon a permanent separation from employment;
    (2) severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, and any other money payments, except earnings under
subdivision 5, and back pay under subdivision 6, paid by an employer because of, upon, or after
separation from employment, but only if the money payment is considered wages at the time of
payment under section 268.035, subdivision 29, or United States Code, title 26, section 3121, clause
                                              ­. This clause does not apply to the first $5,000 of any
(2), of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act;
amount of severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, or any other payments paid to an employee; or
    (3) pension, retirement, or annuity payments from any plan contributed to by a base period
employer including the United States government, except Social Security benefits which are
provided for in subdivision 4. The base period employer contributed to the plan if the contribution
is excluded from the definition of wages under section 268.035, subdivision 29, clause (1), or
United States Code, title 26, section 3121, clause (2), of the Federal Insurance Contribution Act.
   An applicant shall not be considered to have received the lump sum payment if the applicant
immediately deposits that payment in a qualified pension plan or account; or
   (4) holiday pay.
    (b) This subdivision shall apply to all the weeks of payment and shall be applied to the period
immediately following the last day of employment. The number of weeks of payment shall be
determined as follows:
    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received shall be divided
by the applicant's last level of regular weekly pay from the employer; or
    (2) if the payment is made in a lump sum, that sum shall be divided by the applicant's last level
of regular weekly pay from the employer.
   (c) If the payment is less than the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount,
unemployment benefits shall be reduced by the amount of the payment. If the computation of
reduced unemployment benefits is not a whole dollar, it shall be rounded down to the next lower
whole dollar.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for unemployment benefits paid on or after
January 1, 2006, regardless of when the continued request was filed or the week for which the
unemployment benefits are paid.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.196, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

assistance or can direct the caller to the person or office that is able to respond to the caller's needs.
      Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268A.01, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Supported employment. (a) "Supported employment" means employment of a person
with a disability so severe that the person needs ongoing training and support to get and keep a job
in which:
    (1) the person engages in paid work in a position removed from the service vendor's site where
individuals without disabilities who do not require public subsidies also may be employed;
    (2) public funds are necessary to provide ongoing training and support services throughout the
period of the person's employment; and
    (3) the person has the opportunity for social interaction with individuals who do not have
disabilities and who are not paid caregivers.
  (b) If the commissioner has certified a rehabilitation facility setting as integrated, then
employment at that site may be considered supported employment.
      Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268A.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 14. Affirmative business enterprise employment. "Affirmative business enterprise
employment" means employment which provides paid work on the premises of an affirmative
business enterprise as certified by the commissioner.
    Affirmative business enterprise employment is considered community employment for purposes
of funding under Minnesota Rules, parts 3300.1000 to 3300.2055, provided that the wages for
individuals reported must be at or above customary wages for the same employer. The employer
must also provide one benefit package that is available to all employees.
      Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268A.085, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

medical condition or uses an ostomy device, provided that the existence of the condition or device
is documented in writing by the customer's physician or a nonprofit organization whose purpose
includes serving individuals who suffer from the condition;
   (2) three or more employees of the retail establishment are working at the time the customer
requests use of the employee restroom facility;
   (3) the retail establishment does not normally make a restroom available to the public;

subzones, if in the commissioner's opinion a modified plan would better meet the objectives of
the biotechnology and health sciences industry zone program. The commissioner shall notify the
applicant of the modifications and provide a statement of the reasons for the modifications.
    Subd. 2. Need indicators. (a) In evaluating applications to determine the need for designation of
a biotechnology and health sciences industry zone, the commissioner shall consider the following
factors as indicators of need:
   (1) the extent to which land in proximity to a significant scientific research institution could be
developed as a higher and better use for biotechnology and health sciences industry facilities;
   (2) the amount of property in or near the zone that is deteriorated or underutilized; and
    (3) the extent to which property in the area would remain underdeveloped or nonperforming due
to physical characteristics.
   (b) The commissioner may require applicants to provide data to demonstrate how the area meets
one or more of the indicators of need.
   Subd. 3. Success indicators. In determining the likelihood of success of a proposed zone, the
commissioner shall consider:

biotechnology and/or medical devices business sectors, and one or more units of local government
with a development plan;
   (2) the extent to which the area has substantial real property with adequate infrastructure and
energy to support new or expanded development;
    (3) the strength and viability of the proposed development goals, objectives, and strategies in
the development plan;
   (4) whether the development plan is creative and innovative in comparison to other applications;
   (5) local public and private commitment to development of a biotechnology and health sciences
industry facility or facilities in the proposed zone and the potential cooperation of surrounding
communities;
   (6) existing resources available to the proposed zone;
   (7) how the designation of the zone would relate to other economic and community development
projects and to regional initiatives or programs;
    (8) how the regulatory burden will be eased for biotechnology and health sciences industry
facilities located in the proposed zone;
    (9) proposals to establish and link job creation and job training in the biotechnology and health
sciences industry with research/educational institutions; and
   (10) the extent to which the development is directed at encouraging, and that designation of the
zone is likely to result in, the creation of high-paying jobs.

a variety of shapes, patterns, and textures predominantly by hand and by only using simple braiding
devices, and maintenance thereof. Hair braiding includes what is commonly known as "African-style
hair braiding" or "natural hair care" but is not limited to any particular cultural, ethnic, racial, or
religious forms of hair styles. Hair braiding includes the making of customized wigs from natural
hair, natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and hair extensions. Hair braiding includes the use of topical
agents such as conditioners, gels, moisturizers, oils, pomades, and shampoos. Hair braiding does
not involve the use of penetrating chemical hair treatments, chemical hair coloring agents, chemical
hair straightening agents, chemical hair joining agents, permanent wave styles, or chemical hair
bleaching agents applied to growing human hair. For purposes of this section, "simple hair braiding
devices" means clips, combs, curlers, curling irons, hairpins, rollers, scissors, needles, thread, and
hair binders including adhesives, if necessary, that are required solely for hair braiding.
    Subd. 3. Requirements. In order to qualify for initial registration, any person engaged in hair
braiding solely for compensation as a profession, except persons licensed as cosmetologists, shall
satisfactorily complete instruction at either an accredited school, professional association, or by an
individual approved by the board. Instruction includes coursework covering the topics of health,
safety, sanitation, and state laws related to cosmetology not to exceed 30 hours. The coursework is
encouraged to be provided in a foreign language format and such availability shall be reported to
and posted by the Minnesota Board of Barber and Cosmetology Examiners.
    Subd. 4. Curriculum. An accredited school, professional association, or an individual approved
by the board desiring to provide the coursework required under subdivision 3 shall have curriculum
in place by January 1, 2008.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008, except subdivision 4 is effective
the day following final enactment.

full amount of the wages, gratuities, and overtime compensation, less any amount the employer is
able to establish was actually paid to the employee and for an additional equal amount as liquidated
damages. In addition, in an action under this subdivision the employee may seek damages and other
appropriate relief provided by subdivision 7 and otherwise provided by law. An agreement between
the employee and the employer to work for less than the applicable wage is not a defense to the
action.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 177.27, subdivision 9, is amended to read:

assessed or otherwise cure the violation, and the contracting authority must withhold the sum ordered

    The commissioner may allow an extension of the two-year period for taking the exam for cases
of hardship or other appropriate circumstances.

   (3) the commissioner of labor and industry receives the completed application and fee before
January 1, 2008;
    (4) the completed application demonstrates that the applicant has had at least two years for

   (3) pay for educational or research projects in the field of residential contracting to further the
purposes of sections 326B.801 to 326B.825; and
   (4) provide information to the public on residential contracting issues.
    Subd. 5. Payment limitations. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commissioner
shall not pay compensation from the fund to an owner or a lessee in an amount greater than $75,000.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the commissioner shall not pay compensation from
the fund to owners and lessees in an amount that totals more than $150,000 per licensee. The
commissioner shall not pay compensation from the fund for a final judgment based on a cause of
action that arose before the commissioner's receipt of the licensee's fee required by subdivision 3.
   Subd. 6. Verified application. To be eligible for compensation from the fund, an owner or lessee
shall serve on the commissioner a verified application for compensation on a form approved by the
commissioner. The application shall verify the following information:
   (1) the specific grounds upon which the owner or lessee seeks to recover from the fund:
   (2) that the owner or the lessee has obtained a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction
against a licensee licensed under section 326B.803;
    (3) that the final judgment was obtained against the licensee on the grounds of fraudulent,
deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure of performance that arose directly
out of a transaction that occurred when the licensee was licensed and performing any of the special
skills enumerated under section 326B.802, subdivision 19;
    (4) the amount of the owner's or the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss on the owner's
residential real estate, on residential real estate leased by the lessee, or on new residential real estate
that has never been occupied or that was occupied by the licensee for less than one year prior to
purchase by the owner;
   (5) that the residential real estate is located in Minnesota;
    (6) that the owner or the lessee is not the spouse of the licensee or the personal representative
of the licensee;
    (7) the amount of the final judgment, any amount paid in satisfaction of the final judgment, and
the amount owing on the final judgment as of the date of the verified application; and
   (8) that the verified application is being served within two years after the judgment became final.
    The owner's and the lessee's actual and direct out-of-pocket loss shall not include attorney fees,
interest on the loss, and interest on the final judgment obtained as a result of the loss. An owner or
lessee may serve a verified application regardless of whether the final judgment has been discharged
by a bankruptcy court. A judgment issued by a court is final if all proceedings on the judgment have
either been pursued and concluded or been forgone, including all reviews and appeals. For purposes
of this section, owners who are joint tenants or tenants in common are deemed to be a single owner.
For purposes of this section, owners and lessees eligible for payment of compensation from the fund
shall not include government agencies, political subdivisions, financial institutions, and any other

   (1) enter into an agreement with an owner or a lessee that resolves the verified application for
compensation from the fund; or
   (2) issue an order to the owner or the lessee accepting, modifying, or denying the verified
application for compensation from the fund.
    Upon receipt of an order issued under clause (2), the owner or the lessee shall have 30 days to
serve upon the commissioner a written request for a hearing. If the owner or the lessee does not
serve upon the commissioner a timely written request for hearing, the order issued under clause (2)
shall become a final order of the commissioner that may not be reviewed by any court or agency.
The commissioner shall order compensation from the fund only if the owner or the lessee has filed a
verified application that complies with subdivision 6 and if the commissioner determines based on
review of the application that compensation should be paid from the fund. The commissioner shall
not be bound by any prior settlement, compromise, or stipulation between the owner or the lessee
and the licensee.
    Subd. 8. Administrative hearing. If an owner or a lessee timely serves a request for hearing
under subdivision 7, the commissioner shall request that an administrative law judge be assigned and
that a hearing be conducted under the contested case provisions of chapter 14 within 30 days after
the service of the request for hearing upon the commissioner. Upon petition of the commissioner,
the administrative law judge shall continue the hearing up to 60 days and upon a showing of good
cause may continue the hearing for such additional period as the administrative law judge deems
appropriate. At the hearing the owner or the lessee shall have the burden of proving by substantial
evidence under subdivision 6, clauses (1) to (8). The administrative law judge shall issue findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and order. If the administrative law judge finds that compensation should
be paid to the owner or the lessee, the administrative law judge shall order the commissioner to
make payment from the fund of the amount it finds to be payable pursuant to the provisions of and
in accordance with the limitations contained in this section. The order of the administrative law
judge shall constitute the final decision of the agency in the contested case. Judicial review of the
administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order shall be in accordance with
sections 14.63 to 14.69.
    Subd. 9. Satisfaction of applications for compensation. The commissioner shall pay
compensation from the fund to an owner or a lessee pursuant to the terms of an agreement that has
been entered into under subdivision 7, clause (1), or pursuant to a final order that has been issued
under subdivision 7, clause (2), or subdivision 8 by December 1 of the fiscal year following the
fiscal year during which the agreement was entered into or during which the order became final,
subject to the limitations of this section. At the end of each fiscal year the commissioner shall
calculate the amount of compensation to be paid from the fund pursuant to agreements that have
been entered into under subdivision 7, clause (1), and final orders that have been issued under
subdivision 7, clause (2), or subdivision 8. If the calculated amount exceeds the amount available
for payment, then the commissioner shall allocate the amount available among the owners and the
lessees in the ratio that the amount agreed to or ordered to be paid to each owner or lessee bears
to the amount calculated. The commissioner shall mail notice of the allocation to all owners and
lessees not less than 45 days following the end of the fiscal year. Any compensation paid by the
commissioner in accordance with this subdivision shall be deemed to satisfy and extinguish any
right to compensation from the fund based upon the verified application of the owner or lessee.

owner or a lessee pursuant to an agreement under subdivision 7, clause (1), or a final order issued
under subdivision 7, clause (2), or subdivision 8, then the commissioner shall be subrogated to all of
the rights, title, and interest in the owner's or lessee's final judgment in the amount of compensation
paid from the fund and the owner or the lessee shall assign to the commissioner all rights, title, and
interest in the final judgment in the amount of compensation paid. The commissioner shall deposit
in the fund money recovered under this subdivision.
   Subd. 11. Effect of section on commissioner's authority. Nothing contained in this section
shall limit the authority of the commissioner to take disciplinary action against a licensee under the
provisions of this chapter. A licensee's repayment in full of obligations to the fund shall not nullify or
modify the effect of any other disciplinary proceeding brought under the provisions of this chapter.
   Subd. 12. Limitation. Nothing may obligate the fund to compensate:
   (1) insurers or sureties under subrogation or similar theories; or
    (2) owner of residential property for final judgments against a prior owner of the residential
property unless the claim is brought and judgment is rendered for breach of the statutory warranty
set forth in chapter 327A.
    Subd. 13. Condominiums or townhouses. For purposes of this section, the owner or the lessee
of a condominium or townhouse is considered an owner or a lessee of residential property regardless
of the number of residential units per building.
    Subd. 14. Accelerated compensation. (a) Payments made from the fund to compensate owners
and lessees that do not exceed the jurisdiction limits for conciliation court matters as specified in
section 491A.01 may be paid on an accelerated basis if all of the requirements in paragraphs (b) and
(c) have been satisfied.
    (b) The owner or the lessee has served upon the commissioner a verified application for
compensation that complies with the requirements set out in subdivision 6 and the commissioner
determines based on review of the application that compensation should be paid from the fund.
The commissioner shall calculate the actual and direct out-of-pocket loss in the transaction, minus
attorney fees, interest on the loss and on the judgment obtained as a result of the loss, and any
satisfaction of the judgment, and make payment to the owner or the lessee up to the conciliation
court jurisdiction limits within 15 days after the owner or lessee serves the verified application.
    (c) The commissioner may pay compensation to owners or lessees that totals not more than
$50,000 per licensee per fiscal year under this accelerated process. The commissioner may prorate
the amount of compensation paid to owners or lessees under this subdivision if applications
submitted by owners and lessees seek compensation in excess of $50,000 against a licensee. Any
unpaid portion of a verified application that has been prorated under this subdivision shall be
satisfied in the manner set forth in subdivision 9.

percent of the residents reside within a taconite assistance area as defined in section 273.1341. All
expenditures and projects made by the commissioner of Iron Range resources and rehabilitation shall

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.227, is amended to read:
     298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each taconite producer's taxable production and
qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a, shall be held by the Iron Range Resources
and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic development fund for each taconite
and direct reduced ore producer. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives
of the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that
producer. The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each
local employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the

employee committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees.
The review must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal for
expenditure of the funds to the committee. The funds held pursuant to this section may be released
only for acquisition of plant and stationary mining equipment and facilities for the producer or
for research and development in Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production
technology, but only if the producer provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same
purpose of at least 50 percent of the distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton beginning with
distributions in 2002. Effective for proposals for expenditures of money from the fund approved
beginning the day following final enactment, the commissioner may release the funds only if the
proposed expenditure is approved by a majority of the members of the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board. If a producer uses money which has been released from the fund prior to the
day following final enactment to procure haulage trucks, mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and
the producer removes the piece of equipment from the taconite tax relief area defined in section
273.134 within ten years from the date of receipt of the money from the fund, a portion of the
money granted from the fund must be repaid to the taconite economic development fund. The
portion of the money to be repaid is 100 percent of the grant if the equipment is removed from the
taconite tax relief area within 12 months after receipt of the money from the fund, declining by
ten percent for each of the subsequent nine years during which the equipment remains within the
taconite tax relief area. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the facility had
ceased, any money remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to the purchaser
of the facility on the terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this section. If a
producer fails to provide matching funds for a proposed expenditure within six months after the
commissioner approves release of the funds, the funds are available for release to another producer
in proportion to the distribution provided and under the conditions of this section. Any portion of
the fund which is not released by the commissioner within two years of its deposit in the fund shall
be divided between the taconite environmental protection fund created in section 298.223 and the
Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292 for placement in their
respective special accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased funds shall be distributed to the taconite
environmental protection fund and one-third to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust
fund.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for proposals for expenditures of money from
the fund the day following final enactment.

enter into reciprocity agreements for personal licenses with another state if approved by the board.
Once approved by the board, the commissioner may issue a personal license without requiring the
applicant to pass an examination provided the applicant:
      (a) submits an application under section 326.242;
      (b) pays the fee required under section 326.242; and
      (c) holds a valid comparable license in the state participating in the agreement.
      Agreements are subject to the following:
   (1) The parties to the agreement must administer a statewide licensing program that includes
examination and qualifying experience or training comparable to Minnesota's.
   (2) The experience and training requirements under which an individual applicant qualified for
examination in the qualifying state must be deemed equal to or greater than required for an applicant
making application in Minnesota at the time the applicant acquired the license in the qualifying state.
   (3) The applicant must have acquired the license in the qualifying state through an examination
deemed equivalent to the same class of license examination in Minnesota. A lesser class of license
may be granted where the applicant has acquired a greater class of license in the qualifying state
and the applicant otherwise meets the conditions of this subdivision.
   (4) At the time of application, the applicant must hold a valid license in the qualifying state and
have held the license continuously for at least one year before making application in Minnesota.

    (5) An applicant is not eligible for a license under this subdivision if the applicant has failed the
same or greater class of license examination in Minnesota, or if the applicant's license of the same
or greater class has been revoked or suspended.
   (6) An applicant who has failed to renew a personal license for two years or more after its
expiration is not eligible for a license under this subdivision.

   Where multiple disconnects are grouped at a single location and are supplied by a single set of
supply conductors the cumulative rating of the overcurrent devices shall be used to determine the
supply ampere capacity.
    Subd. 4. Fee for circuits, feeders, feeder taps, or sets of transformer secondary conductors.
The inspection fee for the installation, addition, alteration, or repair of each circuit, feeder, feeder
tap, or set of transformer secondary conductors, including the equipment served, is:
   (1) 0 ampere to and including 200 ampere capacity, $

out the intent of this chapter; provided, that the administration and supervision of supplementary
instruction in related subjects for apprentices; coordination of instruction on a concurrent basis with
job experiences, and the selection and training of teachers and coordinators for such instruction
shall be the function of state and local boards responsible for vocational education. The director
shall have the authority to make wage determinations applicable to the graduated schedule of wages
and journeyman wage rate for apprenticeship agreements, giving consideration to the existing
wage rates prevailing throughout the state, except that no wage determination by the director shall
alter an existing wage provision for apprentices or journeymen that is contained in a bargaining
agreement in effect between an employer and an organization of employees, nor shall the director
make any determination for the beginning rate for an apprentice that is below the wage minimum
established by federal or state law.

adjutant general or the Minnesota Historical Society may, for the purposes of this section, surrender
the immediate custody and control of regimental battle flags, standards, and guidons under
conditions and safeguards the adjutant general or the Minnesota Historical Society deems necessary

at once be again properly stored or displayed. The adjutant general or the Minnesota Historical
Society shall provide adequate storage and display space for flags, standards, and guidons which
have been repaired and restored.
    Subd. 3. Battle flags; care and control. (a) The flags and colors carried by Minnesota troops in

control of the Minnesota Historical Society. They shall be suitably encased and marked, and, so far
as the historical society may deem it consistent with the safety of the flags and colors, they shall be
publicly displayed in the capitol.
    (b) The flags and colors carried by Minnesota troops in subsequent wars shall be preserved under
the care and control of the adjutant general. They shall be suitably encased and marked, and, so far as
the adjutant general may deem it consistent with the safety of the flags and colors, shall be publicly
displayed.

     Subd. 2. Fees. The commissioner shall by rule establish reasonable fees for seals, installation
seals and inspections which are sufficient to cover all costs incurred in the administration of
sections 327.31 to 327.35. The commissioner shall also establish by rule a monitoring inspection
fee in an amount that will comply with the secretary's fee distribution program. This monitoring
inspection fee shall be an amount paid by the manufacturer for each manufactured home produced
in Minnesota. The monitoring inspection fee shall be paid by the manufacturer to the secretary. The
rules of the fee distribution program require the secretary to distribute the fees collected from all
manufactured home manufacturers among states approved and conditionally approved based on the
number of new manufactured homes whose first location after leaving the manufacturer is on the
premises of a distributor, dealer or purchaser in that state. A                 ­­l

     Sec. 8. NANOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FUND PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Program established; purpose. The nanotechnology development fund
program (NDF) is established to develop a collaborative economic development initiative between
the state of Minnesota, the private sector, and multiple academic institutions to promote by small
businesses an increased use of advanced nanoinstrumentation for characterization, fabrication,
and other related processes; provide research consulting by knowledgeable specialists; and
provide student internship opportunities to increase nanotechnology experience by working with
small, medium, or large Minnesota companies. The NDF program shall be administered by the
2862                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [62ND DAY

Department of Employment and Economic Development and is not a state agency.
   Subd. 2. Definition; qualifying Minnesota small business. "Qualifying Minnesota small
business" means:
   (1) a Minnesota small business corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership that has fewer
than 50 employees; or
      (2) a Minnesota business corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership that:
      (i) has 51 to 100 employees; and
   (ii) demonstrates current financial adversity or risk or a major prospect of aiding the business's
long-term outlook by significant use of nanotechnology in the business's offerings.
   Subd. 3. Grants. The commissioner shall extend onetime matching grants from the NDF to
qualifying Minnesota small businesses located throughout the state to:
   (1) add nanotechnology applications to products that are being developed by Minnesota small
businesses to enhance distinctiveness;
   (2) promote the depth, breadth, and value of technologies being developed by Minnesota
businesses with the aid of nanotechnology;
   (3) encourage more frequent use of nanoinstrumentation to speed businesses' product
time-to-market, with higher incidence of distinct product characteristics;
      (4) provide Minnesota small businesses with broader access to experienced research consultants;
and
      (5) increase the number of researchers experienced in working with nanoinstrumentation.
   Subd. 4. Grant application and award procedure. (a) The commissioner may give priority to
applicants:
   (1) whose intellectual property would benefit from utilization of nanoinstrumentation not
possessed in-house;
    (2) who are currently utilizing nanoinstrumentation either at the University of Minnesota or a
private sector location on a leased, hourly basis; and
      (3) who wish to increase their access to experienced research consultants.
      (b) The commissioner shall decide whether to award a grant to an eligible applicant based on:
    (1) the applicant's planned frequency of usage of nanoinstrumentation for characterization,
fabrication, and other related processes; and
    (2) the applicant's demonstration of rental of nanoinstrumentation, in the form of a signed
affidavit from a certified facility to confirm the one-to-one private sector investment has been met.
      (c) A grant made under this section must:
      (1) include verification of matching rental fees or internship stipends paid by the grantee; and

    (2) be for a total amount paid to each grantee of not less than $500 nor more than $20,000 within
the biennium.
    Subd. 5. Administration. The commissioner of employment and economic development must
develop and maintain a record-keeping system that specifies how funds from the NDF are applied
for and distributed. Businesses receiving grants from the NDF must provide contact information,
the date and time of the use of the nanoinstrumentation, proof of their matching contribution to meet
the rental costs or provide an internship's stipend, and a general statement of the expected outcome
from the use of the nanoinstrumentation, to the extent documentation can be made without divulging
proprietary information.
    Subd. 6. Gifts and donations. Gifts and donations, including land or interests in land, may be
made to NDF. Noncash gifts and donations must be disposed of for cash as soon as the commissioner
of employment and economic development can prudently maximize the value of the gift or donation.
    Subd. 7. Report to legislature. By June 30 of each odd-numbered year, the commissioner of
employment and economic development must submit a report to the legislature with statistics about
the use of the NDF.
   Sec. 9. WORK GROUP.
   The commissioner of employment and economic development shall convene a work group to
evaluate the impact of the money appropriated for wage incentives and how the wage incentive
program works. The work group is to make recommendations to the legislature by January 15, 2008.
   Sec. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Unless another effective date is expressly provided, this act is effective July 1, 2007."

given them.
   (a) "Completion of the evaluation process" means that the granting agency has completed
negotiating the grant agreement with the selected grantee.
   (b) "Grant agreement" has the meaning given in section 16B.97, subdivision 1.
   (c) "Grantee" means a person that applies for or receives a grant.
   (d) "Granting agency" means the state government entity that provides the grant.

to the granting agency has been reached.
    (f) "Request for proposal" means the data outlining the responsibilities the granting agency wants
the grantee to assume.
   (g) "Response" means the data submitted by a grantee as required by a request for proposal.
    Subd. 2. Request for applications. Data created by a granting agency to create a request for
proposal is classified as nonpublic until the request for proposal is published. To the extent that a
granting agency involves persons outside the granting agency to create the request for proposal, the
data remain nonpublic in the hands of all persons who may not further disseminate any data that are
created or reviewed as part of the request for proposal development. At publication, the data in the
request for proposal is public.

process, all remaining data in the responses is public with the exception of trade secret data as defined

    (b) If all responses are rejected prior to completion of the evaluation process, all data, other
than that made public at the opening, remain private or nonpublic until a resolicitation of proposals
results in completion of the evaluation process or a determination is made to abandon the grant.
If the rejection occurs after the completion of the evaluation process, the data remain public. If a
resolicitation of proposals does not occur within one year of the grant opening date, the remaining
data become public.
   Subd. 4. Evaluation data. (a) Data created or maintained by a granting agency as part of the
evaluation process referred to in this section are protected nonpublic data until completion of the
evaluation process at which time the data are public with the exception of trade secret data as defined
and classified in section 13.37.
    (b) If a granting agency asks individuals outside the granting agency to assist with the
evaluation of the responses, the granting agency may share not public data in the responses with
those individuals. The individuals participating in the evaluation may not further disseminate the
not public data they review.

and the capital improvements on the state bond financed property, the lessor may agree to reimburse
the lessee for its investment in the land and capital improvements. The reimbursement may be paid,
at the option of the lessor and lessee, at the time of nonrenewal without a requirement for a prior
escrow of funds or at a later date and on additional terms agreed to by the lessor and the lessee. A
lease or management contract must be terminable by the contracting public officer or agency if the
other contracting party defaults under the contract or if the governmental program is terminated or
changed, and must provide for program oversight by the contracting public officer or agency. The
expiration or termination of a lease or management agreement does not require that the state bond
proceeds be repaid or that the property be sold, so long as the property continues to be operated by,
or on behalf of, the public officer or agency for the intended government program. Money received
by the public officer or agency under the lease or management contract that is not needed to pay
and not authorized to be used to pay operating costs of the property, or to pay the principal, interest,
redemption premiums, and other expenses when due on debt related to the property other than state
bonds, must be:
   (1) paid to the commissioner in the same proportion as the state bond financing is to the total
public debt financing for the property, excluding debt issued by a unit of government for which it
has no financial liability;
    (2) deposited in the state bond fund; and
   (3) used to pay or redeem or defease bonds issued to finance the property in accordance with the
commissioner's order authorizing their issuance.
    The money paid to the commissioner is appropriated for this purpose.
    (c) With the approval of the commissioner, a lease or management contract between a city and a
nonprofit corporation under section 471.191, subdivision 1, need not require the lessee to pay rentals
sufficient to pay the principal, interest, redemption premiums, and other expenses when due with
respect to state bonds issued to acquire and better the facilities.

to leases, grant agreements, or management agreements entered into on or after that date.
    Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.695, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Sale of property. A public officer or agency shall not sell any state bond financed
property unless the public officer or agency determines by official action that the property is no
longer usable or needed by the public officer or agency to carry out the governmental program for
which it was acquired or constructed, the sale is made as authorized by law, the sale is made for fair
market value, and the sale is approved by the commissioner. If any state bonds issued to purchase
or better the state bond financed property that is sold remain outstanding on the date of sale, the net
proceeds of sale must be applied as follows:
    (1) if the state bond financed property was acquired and bettered solely with state bond proceeds,
the net proceeds of sale must be paid to the commissioner,                ­and deposited in the state ­        bo­n

contributed to the acquisition or betterment of the property and paid to the interested public and
private entities, other than any private lender already paid in full, and the proceeds are appropriated
for this purpose. In calculating the share contributed by each entity, the amount to be attributed to
the owner of the property shall be the fair market value of the property that was bettered by state
bond proceeds at the time the betterment began.

matching money may be pledged payments that have been deposited into a segregated account or
multiyear pledges that are converted into cash or cash equivalent through a loan or irrevocable letter
of credit from a financial institution. The loan or irrevocable letter of credit may be secured by a
lien on the state bond financed property.

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.695, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 7. Ground lease for state bond financed property. A public officer or agency, as lessee,
may lease real property and improvements that are to be acquired or improved with state bond
proceeds. The lease must be for a term equal to or longer than 125 percent of the useful life of
the property. The expiration of the lease upon the end of its term does not require that the state be
repaid or that the property be sold and upon the expiration the real property and improvements are
no longer state bond financed property.

use of general obligation grants and the ownership and operation of state bond-financed property.
General obligation grants may only be issued and used to finance the acquisition and betterment of
public lands and buildings and other public improvements of a capital nature that are used to operate
a governmental program, and for predesign and design activities for specifically identified projects
that involve the operation of a governmental program or activity. A general obligation grant may
not be used for general operating expenses, staffing, or general master planning. A public officer or
agency that is the recipient of a general obligation grant must comply with this section in its use

of the general obligation grant and operation, management, lease, and sale of state bond-financed
property. A public officer or agency that uses the proceeds of a general obligation grant for any
unauthorized purpose or in violation of this section must immediately repay the outstanding balance
of the grant to the commissioner, and a failure to comply authorizes the commissioner to recover
the outstanding balance as a setoff against any state aid provided to the public officer or agency.
   (b) This section does not create any new authority regarding the ownership, construction,
rehabilitation, use, operation, lease management, or sale of state bond-financed property, or the
operation of the governmental program that will be operated on the property. Any authority that is
needed to enter into a management contract or lease of property, to sell property, or to operate a
governmental program or carry out any activity contained in the law that appropriates money for a
general obligation grant must be provided by as contained in some other law.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective on and after July 1, 2007.
     Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.695, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Grant agreement. All general obligation grants must be evidenced by a grant
agreement that specifies:
     (1) how the general obligation grant will be used;
     (2) the governmental program that will be operated on the state bond-financed property; and
    (3) that the state bond-financed property must be operated in compliance with this section, all
state and federal laws, and in a manner that will not cause the interest on the state general obligation
bonds to be or become subject to federal income taxation for any reason. A grant agreement must
comply with this section, the Minnesota Constitution, and all commissioner's orders, and also
contain other provisions the commissioner of the agency making the grant deems appropriate.
The commissioner shall draft and make available forms for grant agreements that satisfy the
requirements of this subdivision.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective on and after July 1, 2007.

carry out all the responsibilities under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as provided by Public
Law 108-364, as amended. The Minnesota Assistive Technology Advisory Council is established
to fulfill the responsibilities required by the Assistive Technology Act, as provided by Public Law
108-364, as amended. Because the existence of this council is required by federal law, this council
does not expire and the expiration date provided in section 15.059, subdivision 5, does not apply.
    (b) The governor shall appoint the membership of the council as required by the Assistive
Technology Act of 1998, as provided by Public Law 108-364, as amended. After the governor
has completed the appointments required by this subdivision, the commissioner of administration,
or the commissioner's designee, shall convene the first meeting of the council following the

appointments. Members shall serve two-year terms commencing July 1 of each odd-numbered
year, and receive the compensation specified by the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as provided
by Public Law 108-364, as amended. The members of the council shall select their chair at the first
meeting following their appointment.
    Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16B.24, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Renting out state property. (a) Authority. The commissioner may rent out state
property, real or personal, that is not needed for public use, if the rental is not otherwise provided
for or prohibited by law. The property may not be rented out for more than five years at a time
without the approval of the State Executive Council and may never be rented out for more than 25
years. A rental agreement may provide that the state will reimburse a tenant for a portion of capital
improvements that the tenant makes to state real property if the state does not permit the tenant to
renew the lease at the end of the rental agreement.
    (b) Restrictions. Paragraph (a) does not apply to state trust fund lands, other state lands under
the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources, lands forfeited for delinquent taxes, lands
acquired under section 298.22, or lands acquired under section 41.56 which are under the jurisdiction
of the Department of Agriculture.
    (c) Rental of living accommodations. The commissioner shall establish rental rates for all
living accommodations provided by the state for its employees. Money collected as rent by state
agencies pursuant to this paragraph must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the general
fund.
     (d) Lease of space in certain state buildings to state agencies. The commissioner may
lease portions of the state-owned buildings ­n       i­­ ­h

a segregated asset preservation and replacement account in a special revenue fund. Fifty percent
of the money credited to the account each fiscal year must be transferred to the general fund. The
remaining money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner to be expended for asset
preservation projects as determined by the commissioner. Money collected as rent to recover the
depreciation and interest costs of a building built with other state dedicated funds shall be credited
to the dedicated fund which funded the original acquisition or construction. All other money
received shall be credited to the general services revolving fund.

Money used for this purpose is available only for the acquisition of works of art to be exhibited in
areas of a building or its grounds accessible, on a regular basis, to members of the public. No more
than ten percent of the total amount available each fiscal year under this subdivision may be used
for administrative expenses, either by the commissioner of administration or by any other entity to
whom the commissioner delegates administrative authority. For the purposes of this section "state
building" means a building the construction or alteration of which is paid for wholly or in part by
the state.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007. The repeal of the $100,000 limit in
this section applies to appropriations made before, on, or after that date.
     Sec. 25. [16B.97] GRANTS MANAGEMENT.
   Subdivision 1. Grant agreement. (a) A grant agreement is a written instrument or electronic
document defining a legal relationship between a granting agency and a grantee when the principal
purpose of the relationship is to transfer cash or something of value to the recipient to support
a public purpose authorized by law instead of acquiring by professional or technical contract,
purchase, lease, or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the granting agency.
    (b) This section does not apply to capital project grants to political subdivisions as defined by
section 16A.86.
    Subd. 2. Grants governance. The commissioner shall provide leadership and direction for
policy related to grants management in Minnesota in order to foster more consistent, streamlined
interaction between executive agencies, funders, and grantees that will enhance access to grant
opportunities and information and lead to greater program accountability and transparency. The
commissioner has the duties and powers stated in this section. An executive agency must do what
the commissioner requires under this section.
     Subd. 3. Discretionary powers. The commissioner has the authority to:
   (1) review grants management practices and propose policy and procedure improvements to the
governor, legislature, executive agencies, and the federal government;
   (2) sponsor, support, and facilitate innovative and collaborative grants management projects with
public and private organizations;
     (3) review, recommend, and implement alternative strategies for grants management;

   (4) collect and disseminate information, issue reports relating to grants management, and sponsor
and conduct conferences and studies; and
    (5) participate in conferences and other appropriate activities related to grants management
issues.
   Subd. 4. Duties. (a) The commissioner shall:
    (1) create general grants management policies and procedures that are applicable to all executive
agencies. The commissioner may approve exceptions to these policies and procedures for particular
grant programs. Exceptions shall expire or be renewed after five years. Executive agencies shall
retain management of individual grants programs;
   (2) provide a central point of contact concerning statewide grants management policies and
procedures;
   (3) serve as a resource to executive agencies in such areas as training, evaluation, collaboration,
and best practices in grants management;
    (4) ensure grants management needs are considered in the development, upgrade, and use of
statewide administrative systems and leverage existing technology wherever possible;
    (5) oversee and approve future professional and technical service contracts and other information
technology spending related to executive agency grants management activities;
   (6) provide a central point of contact for comments about executive agencies violating statewide
grants governance policies and about fraud and waste in grants processes;
    (7) forward received comments to the appropriate agency for further action, and may follow up
as necessary;
    (8) provide a single listing of all available executive agency competitive grant opportunities and
resulting grant recipients;
   (9) selectively review development and implementation of executive agency grants, policies,
and practices; and
   (10) selectively review executive agency compliance with best practices.
   (b) The commissioner may determine that it is cost-effective for agencies to develop and use
shared grants management technology systems. This system would be governed under section
16E.01, subdivision 3, paragraph (b).
   Sec. 26. [16B.98] GRANTS MANAGEMENT PROCESS.
    Subdivision 1. Limitation. As a condition of receiving a grant from an appropriation of state
funds, the recipient of the grant must agree to minimize administrative costs. The granting agency
is responsible for negotiating appropriate limits to these costs so that the state derives the optimum
benefit for grant funding.
    Subd. 2. Ethical practices and conflict of interest. An employee of the executive branch
involved directly or indirectly in grants processes, at any level, is subject to the code of ethics in
section 43A.38.
62ND DAY]                               FRIDAY, MAY 4, 2007                                       2895

    Subd. 3. Conflict of interest. (a) The commissioner must develop policies regarding code of
ethics and conflict of interest designed to prevent conflicts of interest for employees, committee
members, or others involved in the recommendation, awarding, and administration of grants. The
policies must apply to employees who are directly or indirectly in the grants process, which may
include the following:
      (1) developing request for proposals or evaluation criteria;
      (2) drafting, recommending, awarding, amending, revising, or entering into grant agreements;
      (3) evaluating or monitoring performance; or
      (4) authorizing payments.
      (b) The policies must include:
    (1) a process to make all parties to the grant aware of policies and laws relating to conflict of
interest, and training on how to avoid and address potential conflicts; and
  (2) a process under which those who have a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest
must disclose the matter.
    (c) If the employee, appointing authority, or commissioner determines that a conflict of interest
exists, the matter shall be assigned to another employee who does not have a conflict of interest. If it
is not possible to assign the matter to an employee who does not have a conflict of interest, interested
personnel shall be notified of the conflict and the employee may proceed with the assignment.
    Subd. 4. Reporting of violations. A state employee who discovers evidence of violation of
laws or rules governing grants is encouraged to report the violation or suspected violation to the
employee's supervisor, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, or the legislative auditor.
The legislative auditor shall report to the Legislative Audit Commission if there are multiple
complaints about the same agency. The auditor's report to the Legislative Audit Commission under
this section must disclose only the number and type of violations alleged. An employee making
a good faith report under this section has the protections provided for under section 181.932,
prohibiting the employer from discriminating against the employee.
    Subd. 5. Creation and validity of grant agreements. (a) A grant agreement is not valid and
the state is not bound by the grant unless:
      (1) the grant has been executed by the head of the agency or a delegate who is party to the grant;
and
    (2) the accounting system shows an encumbrance for the amount of the grant in accordance with
policy approved by the commissioner.
    (b) The combined grant agreement and amendments must not exceed five years without specific,
written approval by the commissioner according to established policy, procedures, and standards,
or unless the commissioner determines that a longer duration is in the best interest of the state.
    (c) A fully executed copy of the grant agreement with all amendments and other required records

    Subd. 2. Creation and validity of contracts. (a) A contract is not valid and the state is not
bound by it and no agency, without the prior written approval of the commissioner granted pursuant

state:
      (1) returns the corporation to good standing as of the date of the dissolution;
    (2) validates contracts or other acts within the authority of the articles, and the corporation is
liable for those contracts or acts; and
   (3) restores to the corporation all assets and rights of the corporation to the extent they were
held by the corporation before the dissolution occurred, except to the extent that assets or rights
were affected by acts occurring after the dissolution or sold or otherwise distributed after that time.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2008.
      Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 308A.995, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

the requirements of this section by December 31 of the calendar year for which the registration was
required must be dissolved by the secretary of state as described in paragraph (b).
     (b) If the cooperative has not filed the registration by December 31 of that calendar year, the
secretary of state must issue a certificate of involuntary dissolution, and the certificate must be filed in
the Office of the Secretary of State. T        ­h­­e­­e­

    The Uniform Commercial Code account is established as an account in the state treasury. Fees

    Fees that are not expressly set by statute but are charged by the secretary of state to offset the
costs of providing information contained in the computerized records maintained by the secretary of
state must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the Uniform Commercial Code account.
    Money in the Uniform Commercial Code account is continuously appropriated to the secretary
of state to implement and maintain the central filing system under this chapter, to provide, improve,
and expand other online or remote lien and business entity filing, retrieval, and payment method
services provided by the secretary of state, and to provide electronic access to other computerized
records maintained by the secretary of state.
   Sec. 65. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 336.9-516, is amended to read:
   336.9-516 WHAT CONSTITUTES FILING; EFFECTIVENESS OF FILING.
    (a) What constitutes filing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), communication of
a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office
constitutes filing.
   (b) Refusal to accept record; filing does not occur. Filing does not occur with respect to a
record that a filing office refuses to accept because:
     (1) the record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the
filing office. For purposes of filing office authorization, transmission of records using the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) format is authorized by the filing office after the later of July 1, 2007, or
the determination of the secretary of state that the central filing system is capable of receiving and
processing these records;
   (2) an amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered;
   (3) the filing office is unable to index the record because:
   (A) in the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the
debtor;
   (B) in the case of an amendment or correction statement, the record:
    (i) does not identify the initial financing statement as required by section 336.9-512 or 336.9-518,
as applicable; or
   (ii) identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under section
336.9-515;
    (C) in the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as
an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which
was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does
not identify the debtor's last name; or
     (D) in the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in section
336.9-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which
it relates;
   (4) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of
62ND DAY]                                 FRIDAY, MAY 4, 2007                                               2911

record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record;
   (5) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor
which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the
record does not:
    (A) provide a mailing address for the debtor;
    (B) indicate whether the debtor is an individual or an organization; or
    (C) if the financing statement indicates that the debtor is an organization, provide:
    (i) a type of organization for the debtor;
    (ii) a jurisdiction of organization for the debtor; or
    (iii) an organizational identification number for the debtor or indicate that the debtor has none;
   (6) in the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under section
336.9-514(a) or an amendment filed under section 336.9-514(b), the record does not provide a
name and mailing address for the assignee; or
   (7) in the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period
prescribed by section 336.9-515(d).
    (c) Rules applicable to subsection (b). For purposes of subsection (b):
    (1) a record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the
information; and
    (2) a record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement
to which it relates, as required by section 336.9-512, 336.9-514, or 336.9-518, is an initial financing
statement.
    (d) Refusal to accept record; record effective as filed record. A record that is communicated
to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a
reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a
purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record
from the files.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2007.

   Sec. 76. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 517.08, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
     Subd. 1b. Term of license; fee; premarital education. (a) The local registrar shall examine

the expiration of a five-day period, on being satisfied that there is no legal impediment to it, including
the restriction contained in section 259.13, the local registrar shall issue the license, containing the
full names of the parties before and after marriage, and county and state of residence, with the county

six months. In case of emergency or extraordinary circumstances, a judge of the district court of
the county in which the application is made, may authorize the license to be issued at any time
before the expiration of the five days. Except as provided in paragraph (b), the local registrar shall
collect from the applicant a fee of ­  $1

filing all papers required, and preparing and transmitting to the state registrar of vital statistics the
reports of marriage required by this section. If the license should not be used within the period of
six months due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, it may be surrendered to the local
registrar for cancellation, and in that case a new license shall issue upon request of the parties of the
original license without fee. A local registrar who knowingly issues or signs a marriage license in
any manner other than as provided in this section shall pay to the parties aggrieved an amount not
to exceed $1,000.
    (b) The marriage license fee for parties who have completed at least 12 hours of premarital
education is $

the time of applying for the marriage license a signed and dated statement from the person who
provided the premarital education confirming that it was received. The premarital education must
be provided by a licensed or ordained minister or the minister's designee, a person authorized to
solemnize marriages under section 517.18, or a person authorized to practice marriage and family
therapy under section 148B.33. The education must include the use of a premarital inventory and
the teaching of communication and conflict management skills.
  (c) The statement from the person who provided the premarital education under paragraph (b)
must be in the following form:
    "I, (name of educator), confirm that (names of both parties) received at least 12 hours
of premarital education that included the use of a premarital inventory and the teaching of
communication and conflict management skills. I am a licensed or ordained minister, a person
authorized to solemnize marriages under Minnesota Statutes, section 517.18, or a person licensed
to practice marriage and family therapy under Minnesota Statutes, section 148B.33."
    The names of the parties in the educator's statement must be identical to the legal names of
the parties as they appear in the marriage license application. Notwithstanding section 138.17, the
educator's statement must be retained for seven years, after which time it may be destroyed.
    (d) If section 259.13 applies to the request for a marriage license, the local registrar shall grant
the marriage license without the requested name change. Alternatively, the local registrar may delay
the granting of the marriage license until the party with the conviction:
   (1) certifies under oath that 30 days have passed since service of the notice for a name change
upon the prosecuting authority and, if applicable, the attorney general and no objection has been

Any or all responses may be rejected. When using the request for bid process, the bid must be
awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, taking into consideration conformity with
the specifications, terms of delivery, the purpose for which the contract or purchase is intended, the
status and capability of the vendor, and other considerations imposed in the request for bids. The
commissioner may decide which is the lowest responsible bidder for all purchases and may use the
principles of life-cycle costing, where appropriate, in determining the lowest overall bid. The duties
set forth in this subdivision are subject to delegation pursuant to this section.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 3a. Acquisition authority; construction contracts. For all building and construction
contracts, the commissioner shall award contracts pursuant to section 16C.28, and "best value" shall
be defined and applied as set forth in sections 16C.02, subdivision 4a, and 16C.28, subdivision 1,

paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c). The duties set forth in this subdivision are subject to
delegation pursuant to this section. The commissioner shall establish procedures for developing
and awarding best value requests for proposals for construction projects. The criteria to be used to
evaluate the proposals must be included in the solicitation document and must be evaluated in an
open and competitive manner.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19. Training. Any personnel administering procurement procedures for a user of best
value procurement or any consultant retained by a local unit of government to prepare or evaluate
solicitation documents must be trained, either by the department or through other training, in the
request for proposals process for best value contracting for construction projects. The commissioner
may establish a training program for state and local officials, and vendors and contractors, on best
value procurement for construction projects, including those governed by section 16C.28. If the
commissioner establishes such a training program, the state may charge a fee for providing training.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.26, is amended to read:
   16C.26 COMPETITIVE BIDS OR PROPOSALS.
    Subdivision 1. Application. Except as otherwise provided by sections 16C.10, 16C.26 and
16C.27, all contracts for building and construction or repairs must be based on competitive bids or
proposals. "Competitive proposals" specifically refers to the method of procurement described in
section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c).
    Subd. 2. Requirement contracts. Standard requirement price contracts for building and
construction must be established by competitive bids as provided in subdivision 1. The standard
requirement price contracts may contain escalation clauses and may provide for a negotiated price
increase or decrease based upon a demonstrable industrywide or regional increase or decrease in
the vendor's costs or for the addition of similar products or replacement items not significant to the
total value of existing contracts. The term of these contracts may not exceed five years including
all extensions.
    Subd. 3. Publication of notice; expenditures over $25,000. If the amount of an expenditure
is estimated to exceed $25,000, bids or proposals must be solicited by public notice in a manner
designated by the commissioner. To the extent practical, this must include posting on a state Web
site. For expenditures over $50,000, when a call for bids is issued, the commissioner shall solicit
sealed bids by providing notices to all prospective bidders known to the commissioner by posting
notice on a state Web site at least seven days before the final date of submitting bids. All bids
over $50,000 must be sealed when they are received and must be opened in public at the hour
stated in the notice. All proposals responsive to a request for proposals according to section 16C.28,
subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c), shall be submitted and evaluated in the
manner described in the request for proposals, regardless of the dollar amount. All original bids and
proposals and all documents pertaining to the award of a contract must be retained and made a part
of a permanent file or record and remain open to public inspection.
    Subd. 4. Building and construction contracts; $50,000 or less. An informal bid may be used
for building, construction, and repair contracts that are estimated at less than $50,000. Informal
bids must be authenticated by the bidder in a manner specified by the commissioner. Alternatively,
a request for proposals may be issued according to section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),

clause (2), and paragraph (c), for such contracts.
    Subd. 5. Standard specifications, security. Contracts must be based on the standard
specifications prescribed and enforced by the commissioner under this chapter, unless otherwise
expressly provided or as authorized under section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2),
and paragraph (c). Each ­b­d

   Subd. 6. Noncompetitive bids. Agencies are encouraged to contract with small targeted group
businesses designated under section 16C.16 when entering into contracts that are not subject to
competitive bidding procedures.
       Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Single source of supply. Competitive bidding ­s   i­ or proposals are not required for
contracts clearly and legitimately limited to a single source of supply, and the contract price may be
best established by direct negotiation.
       Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.28, is amended to read:

4a, and described in the solicitation document.
    (b) The vendor or contractor must secure bonding, commercial general insurance coverage,
and workers' compensation insurance coverage under paragraph (a), clause (1) or (2). The
commissioner shall determine whether to use the procurement process described in paragraph (a),
clause (1), or the procurement process described in paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c). If
the commissioner uses the method in paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c), the head of the
agency shall determine which vendor or contractor offers the best value, subject to the approval of
the commissioner. Any or all bids or proposals may be rejected.

    (c) When using the procurement process described in subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), the
solicitation document must state the relative weight of price and other selection criteria. The award
must be made to the vendor or contractor offering the best value applying the weighted selection
criteria. If an interview of the vendor's or contractor's personnel is one of the selection criteria, the
relative weight of the interview shall be stated in the solicitation document and applied accordingly.
    Subd. 1a. Establishment and purpose. (a) The state recognizes the importance of the inclusion
of a best value contracting system for construction as an alternative to the current low-bid system
of procurement. In order to accomplish that goal, state and local governmental entities shall be able
to choose the best value system in different phases.
   (b) "Best value" means the procurement method defined in section 16C.02, subdivision 4a.
   (c) The following entities are eligible to participate in phase I:

which best value construction contracting is used.
    Subd. 2. Alterations and erasures. A bid containing an alteration or erasure of any price
contained in the bid which is used in determining the lowest responsible bid must be rejected unless

printed in ink or typewritten adjacent to it and initialed by an authorized representative of the
responder.

(c).
       Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.52, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contracts. A contract for work or labor, or for the purchase of furniture, fixtures,
or other property, except books registered under the copyright laws, or for the construction or repair
of school houses, the estimated cost or value of which shall exceed that specified in section 471.345,
subdivision 3, must not be made by the school board without first advertising for bids or proposals
by two weeks' published notice in the official newspaper. This notice must state the time and place
of receiving bids and contain a brief description of the subject matter.
   Additional publication in the official newspaper or elsewhere may be made as the board shall
deem necessary.
    After taking into consideration conformity with the specifications, terms of delivery, and other
conditions imposed in the call for bids, every such contract for which a call for bids has been issued
must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, be duly executed in writing, and be otherwise
conditioned as required by law. The person to whom the contract is awarded shall give a sufficient
bond to the board for its faithful performance. Notwithstanding section 574.26 or any other law
to the contrary, on a contract limited to the purchase of a finished tangible product, a board may
require, at its discretion, a performance bond of a contractor in the amount the board considers
necessary. A record must be kept of all bids, with names of bidders and amount of bids, and with the
successful bid indicated thereon. A bid containing an alteration or erasure of any price contained in
the bid which is used in determining the lowest responsible bid must be rejected unless the alteration
or erasure is corrected as provided in this section. An alteration or erasure may be crossed out
and the correction thereof printed in ink or typewritten adjacent thereto and initialed in ink by the
person signing the bid. In the case of identical low bids from two or more bidders, the board may, at
its discretion, utilize negotiated procurement methods with the tied low bidders for that particular
transaction, so long as the price paid does not exceed the low tied bid price. In the case where only
a single bid is received, the board may, at its discretion, negotiate a mutually agreeable contract
with the bidder so long as the price paid does not exceed the original bid. If no satisfactory bid is
received, the board may readvertise. Standard requirement price contracts established for supplies
or services to be purchased by the district must be established by competitive bids. Such standard
requirement price contracts may contain escalation clauses and may provide for a negotiated price
increase or decrease based upon a demonstrable industrywide or regional increase or decrease in
the vendor's costs. Either party to the contract may request that the other party demonstrate such
increase or decrease. The term of such contracts must not exceed two years with an option on the
part of the district to renew for an additional two years. Contracts for the purchase of perishable
food items, except milk for school lunches and vocational training programs, in any amount may
be made by direct negotiation by obtaining two or more written quotations for the purchase or sale,
when possible, without advertising for bids or otherwise complying with the requirements of this
section or section 471.345, subdivision 3. All quotations obtained shall be kept on file for a period
of at least one year after receipt.
    Every contract made without compliance with the provisions of this section shall be void. Except
in the case of the destruction of buildings or injury thereto, where the public interest would suffer
by delay, contracts for repairs may be made without advertising for bids.

(a), clause (2), and paragraph (c).

proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph
(c).

paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c).
   Sec. 17. [161.3206] BEST VALUE CONTRACTING AUTHORITY.
    Notwithstanding sections 16C.25, 161.32, 161.321, or any other law to the contrary, the
commissioner may solicit and award all contracts, other than design-build contracts governed by

16C.02, subdivision 4a. Section 16C.08 does not apply to this section.

award a design-build contract for a project on the basis of a best value selection process. Section
16C.08 does not apply to design-build contracts to which the commissioner is a party.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.38, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Effects on other law of public contract with commissioner. Whenever the road
authority of any city enters into an agreement with the commissioner pursuant to this section, and
a portion of the cost is to be assessed against benefited property, the letting of a public contract
by the commissioner for the work shall be deemed to comply with statutory or charter provisions
requiring the city (1) to advertise for bids before awarding a contract for a public improvement, (2)
to let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder or to the vendor or contractor offering the best
value, and (3) to require a performance bond to be filed by the contractor before undertaking the
work. The contract so let by the commissioner and the performance bond required of the contractor

of complying with the requirements of any applicable law or charter provision, and the bond shall

by the city council and the county board, the commission shall, after notice appropriate to inform
possible bidders, obtain bids or proposals for all or any portion of the work or materials, or both, to be
done, performed, or furnished in the construction of the building. All bids or proposals shall be sealed
by the bidders or proposers and filed with the commission at or before the time specified for the

parts of any construction work by day labor under conditions it prescribes. The commissioners
may establish reasonable qualifications to determine the fitness and responsibility of bidders, and
require bidders to meet the qualifications before bids are accepted. If the commissioners by a
two-thirds or five-sevenths vote declare that an emergency exists requiring the immediate purchase
of any equipment or material or supplies at a cost in excess of $1,000, but not exceeding $5,000,
in amount, or making of emergency repairs, it shall not be necessary to advertise for bids, but
the material, equipment, or supplies may be purchased in the open market at the lowest price
obtainable, or the emergency repairs may be contracted for or performed without securing formal
competitive bids. An emergency, for purposes of this section, is unforeseen circumstances or
conditions which result in the jeopardizing of human life or property.
   In all contracts involving the employment of labor, the commissioners shall stipulate conditions
they deem reasonable, as to the hours of labor and wages and may stipulate as to the residence of
employees to be employed by the contractors.
    Bonds shall be required from contractors for any works of construction as provided in and subject
to all the provisions of sections 574.26 to 574.31.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.068, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Contracts; best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement method
described in subdivision 1, a contract may be awarded to the vendor or contractor offering the best
value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),
clause (2), and paragraph (c).
   Sec. 30. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 469.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Construction contracts. For all contracts for construction, alteration, repair, or
maintenance work, the authority may award contracts to the vendor offering the best value, and
"best value" shall be defined and applied as set forth in sections 16C.02, subdivision 4a, and
16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c). Alternatively, the authority
may award all contracts for construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance work to the lowest
responsible bidder, reserving the right to reject any or all bids.
   Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.345, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
     Subd. 3a. Contracts over $50,000; best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement
method described in subdivision 3, municipalities may award a contract for construction, alteration,
repair, or maintenance work to the vendor or contractor offering the best value under a request for
proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph
(c).
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.345, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

to the procurement method described in subdivision 4, municipalities may award a contract for
construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance work to the vendor or contractor offering the best
value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),
clause (2), and paragraph (c).
   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.345, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Contracts less than $10,000. If the amount of the contract is estimated to be $10,000
or less, the contract may be made either upon quotation or in the open market, in the discretion of
the governing body. If the contract is made upon quotation it shall be based, so far as practicable,
on at least two quotations which shall be kept on file for a period of at least one year after their
receipt. Alternatively, municipalities may award a contract for construction, alteration, repair, or
maintenance work to the vendor or contractor offering the best value under a request for proposals
as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2), and paragraph (c).
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.523, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

   Sec. 35. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.756, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Contracts. The authority may enter into a development agreement with the team, the
county, or any other entity relating to the construction, financing, and use of the ballpark and related
facilities and public infrastructure. The authority may contract for materials, supplies, and equipment
in accordance with sections 471.345 and 473.754, except that the authority, with the consent of the
county, may employ or contract with persons, firms, or corporations to perform one or more or all
of the functions of architect, engineer, or construction manager with respect to all or any part of the
ballpark and public infrastructure. Alternatively, at the request of the team and with the consent
of the county, the authority shall authorize the team to provide for the design and construction
of the ballpark and related public infrastructure, subject to terms of Laws 2006, chapter 257. The
construction manager may enter into contracts with contractors for labor, materials, supplies, and
equipment for the construction of the ballpark and related public infrastructure through the process
of public bidding, except that the construction manager may, with the consent of the authority or
the team:
   (1) narrow the listing of eligible bidders to those which the construction manager determines to
possess sufficient expertise to perform the intended functions;
    (2) award contracts to the contractors that the construction manager determines provide the best
value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),
clause (2), and paragraph (c), which are not required to be the lowest responsible bidder; and
    (3) for work the construction manager determines to be critical to the completion schedule,
award contracts on the basis of competitive proposals or perform work with its own forces without
soliciting competitive bids if the construction manager provides evidence of competitive pricing.
The authority shall require that the construction manager certify, before the contract is signed, a fixed
and stipulated construction price and completion date to the authority and post a performance bond

in an amount at least equal to 100 percent of the certified price, to cover any costs which may be
incurred in excess of the certified price, including but not limited to costs incurred by the authority or
loss of revenues resulting from incomplete construction on the completion date. The authority may
secure surety bonds as provided in section 574.26, securing payment of just claims in connection
with all public work undertaken by it. Persons entitled to the protection of the bonds may enforce
them as provided in sections 574.28 to 574.32, and shall not be entitled to a lien on any property
of the authority under the provisions of sections 514.01 to 514.16. Contracts for construction and
operation of the ballpark must include programs, including Youthbuild, to provide for participation
by small local businesses and businesses owned by people of color, and the inclusion of women
and people of color in the workforces of contractors and ballpark operators. The construction of the
ballpark is a "project" as that term is defined in section 177.42, subdivision 2, and is subject to the
prevailing wage law under sections 177.41 to 177.43.

(2) the number of voter registration applications solicited, collected, or accepted.
   (b) No individual may be deprived of compensation or have compensation automatically
reduced exclusively for failure to solicit, collect, or accept a minimum number of voter registration
applications and no individual may receive additional compensation for reaching or exceeding a
minimum number of voter registration applications.

     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 201.12, is amended to read:
     201.12 PROPER REGISTRATION; VERIFICATION BY MAIL; CHALLENGES.
   Subdivision 1. Notice of registration. To prevent fraudulent voting and to eliminate excess
names, the county auditor may mail to any registered voter a notice stating the voter's name and
address as they appear in the registration files. The notice shall request the voter to notify the county
auditor if there is any mistake in the information.

                          s Moved within state. If the notice is returned as undeliverable but with a
permanent forwarding address in this state, the county auditor shall notify the auditor of the county
where the voter resides. Upon receipt of the notice, the county auditor shall update the voter's address
in the statewide voter registration system and mail to the voter the notice of registration required by
section 201.121, subdivision 2. The notice must advise the voter that the voter's voting address has
been changed and that the voter must notify the county auditor within 21 days if the new address is
not what the voter intended to be their permanent address.
    Subd. 3. Moved out of state. If the notice is returned as undeliverable but with a permanent
forwarding address outside this state, the county auditor shall promptly mail to the voter at the
forwarding address a notice advising the voter that the voter's voter registration in this state will be
deleted unless the voter notifies the county auditor within 21 days that the voter intends to retain the
former address as the voter's permanent address. If the notice is not received by the deadline, the
county auditor shall change the voter's status to "inactive" in the statewide registration system.

is returned as undeliverable but with no forwarding address, the county auditor shall change the
registrant's status to "challenged" in the statewide registration system. An individual challenged
in accordance with this subdivision shall comply with the provisions of section 204C.12, before
being allowed to vote. If a notice mailed at least 60 days after the return of the first nonforwardable
mailing is also returned by the postal service, the county auditor shall change the registrant's status
to "inactive" in the statewide registration system.

to the voter the notice of registration required by section 201.121, subdivision 2. The notice must
advise the voter that the voter's permanent address has been changed and that the voter must notify
the county auditor within 21 days if the new address is not what the voter intended to be the voter's
permanent address.
    (b) If the change of permanent address is to a forwarding address outside this state, the secretary
of state shall notify by electronic means the auditor of the county where the voter formerly resided
that the voter has left the state. The county auditor shall promptly mail to the voter at the forwarding
address a notice advising the voter that the voter's voter registration in this state will be deleted
unless the voter notifies the county auditor within 21 days that the voter intends to retain the former
address as the voter's permanent address. If the notice is not received by the deadline, the county
auditor shall change the voter's status to "inactive" in the statewide registration system.

has changed, the secretary of state shall transmit the registration daily by electronic means to the
county auditor of the county where the voter resides.
    (b) If the applicant is not currently registered in the statewide voter registration system, the
secretary of state shall determine whether the applicant is 18 years of age or older and a citizen of
the United States and compare the voter registration information received from the commissioner of
public safety with the information on wards, incompetents, and felons received from the state court
administrator under sections 201.15 and 201.155, to determine whether the applicant is eligible to
vote. If an applicant is less than 18 years of age, the secretary of state shall wait until the applicant has

is not effective until the day after the election.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. An applicant for a Minnesota driver's license, instruction permit, or
identification card must not be registered to vote under this section until the secretary of state has
certified that the system for automatic registration of those applicants has been tested and shown to
properly determine whether an applicant is eligible to vote.

REMOVED.
    Within six weeks after every election, the county auditor shall post the voting history for every
person who voted in the election. After the close of the calendar year, the secretary of state shall

state shall perform list maintenance by changing the status of those registrants to "inactive" in the
statewide registration system. The list maintenance performed must be conducted in a manner that
ensures that the name of each registered voter appears in the official list of eligible voters in the
statewide registration system. A voter must not be removed from the official list of eligible voters
unless the voter is not eligible or is not registered to vote. List maintenance must include procedures
for eliminating duplicate names from the official list of eligible voters.
     The secretary of state shall also prepare a report to the county auditor containing the names of
all registrants whose status was changed to "inactive."

     The absentee ballot board may begin the process of examining the return envelopes and marking
them "accepted" or "rejected" at any time during the 30 days before the election. If an envelope has
been rejected at least five days before the election, the ballots in the envelope must be considered
spoiled ballots and the official in charge of the absentee ballot board shall provide the voter with a
replacement absentee ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot. T                ­­ e­­

    I am a member of the uniformed services or merchant marine on active duty or an eligible spouse
or dependent of such a member; a United States citizen temporarily residing outside the United
States; or other United States citizen residing outside the United States; and I am a United States
citizen, at least 18 years of age (or will be by the date of the election), and I am eligible to vote in
the requested jurisdiction; I have not been convicted of a felony, or other disqualifying offense, or
been adjudicated mentally incompetent, or, if so, my voting rights have been reinstated; and I am
not registering, requesting a ballot, or voting in any other jurisdiction in the United States except
the jurisdiction cited in this voting form. In voting, I have marked and sealed my ballot in private
and have not allowed any person to observe the marking of the ballot, except for those authorized
to assist voters under state or federal law. I have not been influenced.
   My signature and date below indicate when I completed this document.
    The information on this form is true, accurate, and complete to the best of my knowledge.
I understand that a material misstatement of fact in completion of this document may constitute
grounds for a conviction for perjury."

   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 203B.22, is amended to read:
   203B.22 MAILING BALLOTS.
    The county auditor shall mail the appropriate ballots, as promptly as possible, to an absent voter
whose application has been recorded under section 203B.19. If the county auditor determines that
a voter is not eligible to vote at the primary but will be eligible to vote at the general election, only
general election ballots shall be mailed. Only one set of ballots shall be mailed to any applicant for
any election, except that the county auditor may mail a replacement ballot to a voter whose ballot
has been spoiled or lost in transit or whose mailing address has changed after the date on which the
original application was submitted as confirmed by the county auditor. Ballots to be sent outside
the United States shall be given priority in mailing. A county auditor may make use of any special
service provided by the United States government for the mailing of voting materials under sections
203B.16 to 203B.27.
   Sec. 29. [203B.225] TRANSMITTING AND RETURNING BALLOTS.
    Subdivision 1. Transmitting ballot and certificate of voter eligibility. A voter described
in section 203B.16 may include in an application for absentee ballots a request that the ballots,
instructions, and a certificate of voter eligibility meeting the requirements of section 203B.21,
subdivision 3, be transmitted to the voter electronically. Upon receipt of a properly completed
application requesting electronic transmission, the county auditor shall electronically transmit the
requested materials to the voter.
    Subd. 2. Returning voted ballots. The voter must return the voted ballots and the certificate
of voter eligibility to the county auditor in a sealed envelope. Upon receipt of a ballot, the county
auditor must immediately compare the information provided on the absentee ballot application with
the information provided on the certificate of voter eligibility. After the information on the certificate
of voter eligibility has been verified, the certificate must be attached to the ballot secrecy envelope
and placed with the other absentee ballots for the precinct in which the voter resides.
   Subd. 3. Rejecting transmitted ballots. If the county auditor cannot verify that the ballots were

       Sec. 30. [203B.227] WRITE-IN ABSENTEE BALLOT.
    An eligible voter who will be outside the territorial limits of the United States during the 180
days prior to the state general election may use a state write-in absentee ballot to vote in any federal,
state, or local election. In a state or local election, a vote for a political party without specifying the
name of a candidate must not be counted.

The county auditor must establish an absentee ballot board for ballots issued under sections 203B.16
to 203B.27. The board may consist of staff trained and certified as election judges, in which case,
the board is exempt from sections 204B.19, subdivision 5, and 204C.15, relating to party balance in
appointment of judges and to duties to be performed by judges of different major political parties.
    Subd. 2. Duties. The absentee ballot board must examine all returned absentee ballot envelopes
for ballots issued under sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 and accept or reject the absentee ballots in the
manner provided in section 203B.24.
    The absentee ballot board must examine the return envelopes and mark them "accepted" or
"rejected" during the 30 days before the election. If an envelope has been rejected at least five days
before the election, the ballots in the envelope must be considered spoiled ballots and the official in
charge of the absentee ballot board must provide the voter with a replacement absentee ballot and
return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot.
    Subd. 3. Applicable laws. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all the laws applicable
to absentee ballots and absentee voters and all other provisions of the Minnesota Election Law apply
to an absentee ballot board.

license or state identification card number as submitted on the application, if the voter has one of
these documents; and
       (4) the voter has not already voted at that election, either in person or by absentee ballot.
    If the identification number described in clause (3) does not match the number as submitted
on the application, the election judges must make a reasonable effort to satisfy themselves through
other information provided by the applicant, or by an individual authorized to apply on behalf of
the voter, that the ballots were returned by the same person to whom the ballots were transmitted.

the lack of one of clauses (1) to (4). In particular, failure to place the ballot within the security
envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject an absentee ballot.
   Election judges must note the reason for rejection on the back of the envelope in the space
provided for that purpose.
    Failure to return unused ballots shall not invalidate a marked ballot, but a ballot shall not be

to fail to carry out a duty required by Title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002.
    A complaint against a municipal or school district clerk must be filed with the county auditor
of the county in which the action has occurred or is about to occur. A complaint against a county
auditor must be filed with the secretary of state. A complaint against the secretary of state must
be filed with the Office of Administrative Hearings. The secretary of state shall provide a standard
form for a complaint under this section. The form must provide space for the complainant to specify
the legal basis for the complaint. The proceedings authorized by this section are not subject to the
requirements of chapter 14.
   Subd. 2. Notice of complaint. The official with whom the complaint is filed must, within seven
days after the complaint was filed, provide written notice of the complaint, including a copy of the
complaint, to the official against whom the complaint has been made.
    Subd. 3. Response. Within 14 days after the notice of complaint is received, the official
complained against must respond in writing to the complainant and state the manner in which the
respondent proposes to resolve the complaint.
    Subd. 4. Hearing. If the complainant believes the response does not resolve the complaint, the
complainant may file, with the official with whom the complaint was filed, a request for a hearing.
The request must state the objection to the response and propose to resolve the complaint in a way
that is consistent with the Minnesota Election Law. If the complainant makes a request for hearing, a
hearing must take place. The official with whom the complaint was filed must rule on the complaint
within 14 days after the hearing.
    Subd. 5. Timeline. A ruling on a complaint must be made no more than 90 days after the
complaint was filed. If the official with whom the complaint was filed fails to make that ruling
within 90 days after the complaint was filed, that official must provide alternative dispute resolution
for the disposition of the complaint. The alternative dispute resolution process must be completed
within 60 days of its commencement.
    Subd. 6. Appeal. No later than 30 days after the ruling, the complainant may appeal the ruling. If
the complaint was filed against a municipal clerk, school district clerk, or county auditor, the appeal
must be filed with the secretary of state. If the complaint was filed against the secretary of state, the
appeal must be filed with the Ramsey County District Court. The appeal must be heard within 14
days. Upon hearing the appeal, the secretary of state or district court may affirm, reverse, or modify
the ruling and give appropriate instructions, as needed, to the secretary of state, county auditor, or
local election official to resolve the complaint.

must be preaddressed to the auditor or clerk and the voter may return the ballot by mail or in person
to the office of the auditor or clerk. The auditor or clerk may appoint election judges to examine the
return envelopes and mark them "accepted" or "rejected" during the 30 days before the election. If
an envelope has been rejected at least five days before the election, the ballots in the envelope must
be considered spoiled ballots and the auditor or clerk shall provide the voter with a replacement
ballot and return envelope in place of the spoiled ballot. The costs of the mailing shall be paid by
the election jurisdiction in which the voter resides. Any ballot received by 8:00 p.m. on the day of
the election must be counted.

more than 1,000 words, a true and correct copy of the same may be filed with the city clerk, and
the petition shall then contain a summary of not less than 50 nor more than 300 words setting forth
in substance the nature of the proposed amendment. Such summary shall contain a statement of the

with the clerk of the district no later than 5:00 p.m. two days after the last day to file affidavits of
candidacy. A candidate for a hospital district office who wants write-in votes for the candidate to
be counted must file a written request with the filing officer for the office sought no later than the
seventh day before the general election. The filing officer must provide copies of the form to make
the request.
    Voting must be by secret ballot. The clerk shall prepare, at the expense of the district, necessary
ballots for the election of officers. Ballots must be printed on tan paper and prepared as provided in
the rules of the secretary of state. The ballots must be marked and initialed by at least two judges as
official ballots and used exclusively at the election. Any proposition to be voted on may be printed
on the ballot provided for the election of officers. The hospital board may also authorize the use

votes at each polling place. The election judges shall act as clerks of election, count the ballots cast,
and submit them to the board for canvass.
    After canvassing the election, the board shall issue a certificate of election to the candidate who
received the largest number of votes cast for each office. The clerk shall deliver the certificate to the
person entitled to it in person or by certified mail. Each person certified shall file an acceptance and
oath of office in writing with the clerk within 30 days after the date of delivery or mailing of the

     Subd. 3. Deficient registration. No voter registration application is deficient if it contains

Minnesota state identification number, or if the voter has no current and valid Minnesota driver's
license or Minnesota state identification number, the last four digits of the voter's Social Security
number, if the voter has been issued a Social Security number, prior registration, if any, and

the registration to be deficient. The election judges shall request an individual to correct a voter
registration application if it is deficient or illegible o  ­­

accordance with section 201.195 or 204C.12.
    A voter registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, is not deficient for lack
of date of birth. The county or municipality may attempt to obtain the date of birth for a voter
registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, by a request to the voter at any time
except at the polling place. Failure by the voter to comply with this request does not make the
registration deficient.
    A voter registration application accepted before January 1, 2004, is not deficient for lack
of a valid Minnesota driver's license or state identification number or the last four digits of a
Social Security number. A voter registration application submitted by a voter who does not have
a Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, or a Social Security number, is not
deficient for lack of any of these numbers.

     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 205A.11, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Combined polling place. When no other election is being held in two or more precincts
on the day of a school district election, the school board may designate one or more combined
polling places at which the voters in those precincts may vote in the school district election. In school
districts that have organized into separate board member election districts under section 205A.12,
a combined polling place for a school general election must be arranged so that it does not include
more than one board member election district.

                                                        , The municipal clerk in a municipality where an
electronic voting system is used and the county auditor of a county in which an electronic voting
system is used in more than one municipality and the county auditor of a county in which a counting
center serving more than one municipality is located shall prepare a plan which indicates acquisition
of sufficient facilities, computer time, and professional services and which describes the proposed
manner of complying with section 206.80. The plan must be signed, notarized, and submitted to
the secretary of state more than 60 days before the first election at which the municipality uses
an electronic voting system. Prior to July 1 of each subsequent general election year, the clerk or
auditor shall submit to the secretary of state notification of any changes to the plan on file with the
secretary of state. The secretary of state shall review each plan for its sufficiency and may request
technical assistance from the Department of Administration or other agency which may be operating
as the central computer authority. The secretary of state shall notify each reporting authority of the
sufficiency or insufficiency of its plan within 20 days of receipt of the plan. The attorney general,
upon request of the secretary of state, may seek a district court order requiring an election official
to fulfill duties imposed by this subdivision or by rules promulgated pursuant to this section.

    Subdivision 1. Competency of witnesses. Every person of sufficient understanding, including
a party, may testify in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, in court or before any person who
has authority to receive evidence, except as provided in this subdivision:
    (a) A husband cannot be examined for or against his wife without her consent, nor a wife for or
against her husband without his consent, nor can either, during the marriage or afterwards, without
the consent of the other, be examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the
marriage. This exception does not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one against the other, nor
to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one against the other or against a child
of either or against a child under the care of either spouse, nor to a criminal action or proceeding in
which one is charged with homicide or an attempt to commit homicide and the date of the marriage of
the defendant is subsequent to the date of the offense, nor to an action or proceeding for nonsupport,
neglect, dependency, or termination of parental rights.
    (b) An attorney cannot, without the consent of the attorney's client, be examined as to any
communication made by the client to the attorney or the attorney's advice given thereon in the course
of professional duty; nor can any employee of the attorney be examined as to the communication or
advice, without the client's consent.
    (c) A member of the clergy or other minister of any religion shall not, without the consent of
the party making the confession, be allowed to disclose a confession made to the member of the
clergy or other minister in a professional character, in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules
or practice of the religious body to which the member of the clergy or other minister belongs; nor
shall a member of the clergy or other minister of any religion be examined as to any communication
made to the member of the clergy or other minister by any person seeking religious or spiritual
advice, aid, or comfort or advice given thereon in the course of the member of the clergy's or other
minister's professional character, without the consent of the person.
    (d) A licensed physician or surgeon, dentist, or chiropractor shall not, without the consent of the
patient, be allowed to disclose any information or any opinion based thereon which the professional
acquired in attending the patient in a professional capacity, and which was necessary to enable the
professional to act in that capacity; after the decease of the patient, in an action to recover insurance
benefits, where the insurance has been in existence two years or more, the beneficiaries shall be
deemed to be the personal representatives of the deceased person for the purpose of waiving this
privilege, and no oral or written waiver of the privilege shall have any binding force or effect except
when made upon the trial or examination where the evidence is offered or received.
   (e) A public officer shall not be allowed to disclose communications made to the officer in official
confidence when the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.
    (f) Persons of unsound mind and persons intoxicated at the time of their production for
examination are not competent witnesses if they lack capacity to remember or to relate truthfully
facts respecting which they are examined.
    (g) A registered nurse, psychologist, consulting psychologist, or licensed social worker engaged
in a psychological or social assessment or treatment of an individual at the individual's request
shall not, without the consent of the professional's client, be allowed to disclose any information or
opinion based thereon which the professional has acquired in attending the client in a professional
capacity, and which was necessary to enable the professional to act in that capacity. Nothing in this
clause exempts licensed social workers from compliance with the provisions of sections 626.556

and 626.557.
    (h) An interpreter for a person disabled in communication shall not, without the consent of the
person, be allowed to disclose any communication if the communication would, if the interpreter
were not present, be privileged. For purposes of this section, a "person disabled in communication"
means a person who, because of a hearing, speech or other communication disorder, or because of
the inability to speak or comprehend the English language, is unable to understand the proceedings in
which the person is required to participate. The presence of an interpreter as an aid to communication
does not destroy an otherwise existing privilege.
    (i) Licensed chemical dependency counselors shall not disclose information or an opinion based
on the information which they acquire from persons consulting them in their professional capacities,
and which was necessary to enable them to act in that capacity, except that they may do so:
    (1) when informed consent has been obtained in writing, except in those circumstances in which
not to do so would violate the law or would result in clear and imminent danger to the client or
others;
   (2) when the communications reveal the contemplation or ongoing commission of a crime; or
    (3) when the consulting person waives the privilege by bringing suit or filing charges against the
licensed professional whom that person consulted.
    (j) A parent or the parent's minor child may not be examined as to any communication made
in confidence by the minor to the minor's parent. A communication is confidential if made out of
the presence of persons not members of the child's immediate family living in the same household.
This exception may be waived by express consent to disclosure by a parent entitled to claim the
privilege or by the child who made the communication or by failure of the child or parent to object
when the contents of a communication are demanded. This exception does not apply to a civil
action or proceeding by one spouse against the other or by a parent or child against the other, nor
to a proceeding to commit either the child or parent to whom the communication was made or to
place the person or property or either under the control of another because of an alleged mental
or physical condition, nor to a criminal action or proceeding in which the parent is charged with a
crime committed against the person or property of the communicating child, the parent's spouse, or
a child of either the parent or the parent's spouse, or in which a child is charged with a crime or act
of delinquency committed against the person or property of a parent or a child of a parent, nor to
an action or proceeding for termination of parental rights, nor any other action or proceeding on a
petition alleging child abuse, child neglect, abandonment or nonsupport by a parent.

opinion or information received from or about the victim without the consent of the victim. However,
a counselor may be compelled to identify or disclose information in investigations or proceedings
related to neglect or termination of parental rights if the court determines good cause exists. In
determining whether to compel disclosure, the court shall weigh the public interest and need for
disclosure against the effect on the victim, the treatment relationship, and the treatment services if
disclosure occurs. Nothing in this clause exempts sexual assault counselors from compliance with
the provisions of sections 626.556 and 626.557.
    "Sexual assault counselor" for the purpose of this section means a person who has undergone at
least 40 hours of crisis counseling training and works under the direction of a supervisor in a crisis

assault.
    (l) A person cannot be examined as to any communication or document, including worknotes,
made or used in the course of or because of mediation pursuant to an agreement to mediate. This
does not apply to the parties in the dispute in an application to a court by a party to have a mediated
settlement agreement set aside or reformed. A communication or document otherwise not privileged
does not become privileged because of this paragraph. This paragraph is not intended to limit the
privilege accorded to communication during mediation by the common law.
    (m) A child under ten years of age is a competent witness unless the court finds that the child
lacks the capacity to remember or to relate truthfully facts respecting which the child is examined.
A child describing any act or event may use language appropriate for a child of that age.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 484.83, is amended to read:
   484.83 REINSTATEMENT OF FORFEITED SUMS.
    Subdivision 1. Abandonment of fees. All sums deposited with the court administrator to cover
fees shall be deemed abandoned if the fees are not disbursed or the services covered by the fees are
not performed and the person entitled to refund of the fees does not file a written demand for refund
with the court administrator within six months from the date of trial, dismissal, or striking of the
cause as to jury fees and from the date of deposit as to other fees.
    Subd. 2. Bail forfeitures. Any bail not forfeited by court order shall be deemed abandoned and
forfeited if the person entitled to refund does not file a written demand for refund with the court
administrator within six months from the date when the person became entitled to the refund.
    Subd. 3. Reinstated forfeited sums. A district court judge may order any sums forfeited to
be reinstated and the commissioner of finance shall then refund accordingly. The commissioner of
finance shall reimburse the court administrator if the court administrator refunds the deposit upon a
judge's order and obtains a receipt to be used as a voucher.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.
  Sec. 11. [484.843] ABANDONMENT OF NONFELONY BAIL; DISPOSITION OF
FORFEITED SUMS; FOURTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT.
   Subdivision 1. Abandonment of deposits and bail. (a) Any bail deposited with the court
administrator of the Fourth Judicial District on a nonfelony case and not forfeited by court order
shall be deemed abandoned and forfeited if the person entitled to refund does not file a written
demand for refund with the court administrator within six months from the date when the person
became entitled to the refund.
    (b) Any judge may order any sums so forfeited under paragraph (a) to be reinstated for cause and
the court administrator shall then refund accordingly. The receipting municipality or subdivision of
government shall reimburse the court administrator if the court administrator refunds the deposit
upon such an order and obtains a receipt to be used as a voucher.
    Subd. 2. Disposition of forfeited sums. All sums collected on any bail, bond, or recognizance
forfeited by court order or under subdivision 1, paragraph (a), for the Fourth Judicial District on a
nonfelony case shall be paid to Hennepin County to be applied to the support of the law library of the
county. The receipt of the county treasurer to the court administrator shall be a sufficient voucher.
When the sums so forfeited, minus refunds, during any calendar year equal $2,500, all sums in
excess of that amount shall be paid to the municipality or subdivision of government in which the
violation occurred. The payments shall be made periodically but not before six months from the
date of the order for forfeiture. During that six-month period, but not thereafter, any judge may
set aside the forfeiture order upon proper showing of cause. No obligation to pay sums so ordered
forfeited exists unless the forfeiture is not set aside within the six-month period. For the purpose of
determining when the $2,500 shall have accrued to the county law library, the final forfeiture shall
be deemed to occur at the end of the six-month period.

      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 518.165, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Required appointment of guardian ad litem. In all proceedings for child custody
or for marriage dissolution or legal separation in which custody or parenting time with a minor
child is an issue, if the court has reason to believe that the minor child is a victim of domestic
child abuse or neglect, as those terms are defined in sections 260C.007 and 626.556, respectively,
the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem shall represent the interests of
the child and advise the court with respect to custody,­­­

represented by a guardian ad litem in any other pending proceeding, the court may appoint that
guardian to represent the child in the custody or parenting time proceeding. No guardian ad litem
need be appointed if the alleged domestic child abuse or neglect is before the court on a juvenile
dependency and neglect petition. Nothing in this subdivision requires the court to appoint a guardian
ad litem in any proceeding for child custody, marriage dissolution, or legal separation in which an
allegation of domestic child abuse or neglect has not been made.

    (b) A court may order a basic support obligation in a child support order in an amount that
exceeds the income limit in subdivision 2 if it finds that a child has a disability or other substantial,
demonstrated need for the additional support for those reasons set forth in section 518A.43 and that
the additional support will directly benefit the child.

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 563.01, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 609.135, subdivision 8, is amended to read:

surcharges, court costs, restitution, and fees shall survive for a period of six years from the date of
the expiration of the defendant's stayed sentence for the offense for which the fines, surcharges,

the facility and an appropriate prorated amount, given the facility's population, of 65 percent of the
department's management services budget.
    (c) The commissioner shall ensure that these new per diem methods are used in all future annual
performance reports to the legislature and are also reflected in the department's biennial budget
document.

diem calculation based on the formula the commissioner promulgates pursuant to paragraph (a).
   (c) The commissioner shall include the county and regional jail per diem data collected under
paragraph (b) in the Department of Correction's annual performance report to the legislature
mandated by section 241.016.

    Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 299C.65, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Review of funding and grant requests. (a) The Criminal and Juvenile Justice
Information Policy Group shall review the funding requests for criminal justice information
systems from state, county, and municipal government agencies. The policy group shall review the
requests for compatibility to statewide criminal justice information system standards. The review
shall be forwarded to the chairs and ranking minority members of the house and senate committees
and divisions with jurisdiction over criminal justice funding and policy.
    (b) The CriMNet program office, in consultation with the Criminal and Juvenile Justice
Information Task Force and with the approval of the policy group, shall create the requirements
for any grant request and determine the integration priorities for the grant period. The CriMNet
program office shall also review the requests submitted for compatibility to statewide criminal
justice information systems standards.
    (c) The task force shall review funding requests for criminal justice information systems
grants and make recommendations to the policy group. The policy group shall review the
recommendations of the task force and shall make a final recommendation for criminal justice
information systems grants to be made by the commissioner of public safety. Within the limits of
available state appropriations and federal grants, the commissioner of public safety shall make
grants for projects that have been recommended by the policy group.
    (d) The policy group may approve grants only if the applicant provides an appropriate share of

grant offering. The policy group shall adopt policies concerning the use of in-kind resources to
satisfy the match requirement and the sources from which matching funds may be obtained. Local
operational or technology staffing costs may be considered as meeting this match requirement. Each
grant recipient shall certify to the policy group that it has not reduced funds from local, county,
federal, or other sources which, in the absence of the grant, would have been made available to the
grant recipient to improve or integrate criminal justice technology.
    (e) All grant recipients shall submit to the CriMNet program office all requested documentation
including grant status, financial reports, and a final report evaluating how the grant funds improved
the agency's criminal justice integration priorities. The CriMNet program office shall establish the
recipient's reporting dates at the time funds are awarded.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2007.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the first day of the 19th month following the date
of its final enactment.
   Sec. 11. [299F.851] TEST METHOD AND PERFORMANCE STANDARD.
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, no cigarettes may be
sold or offered for sale in this state or offered for sale or sold to persons located in this state unless
(1) the cigarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and have met the performance
standard specified in this section, (2) a written certification has been filed by the manufacturer with
the state fire marshal in accordance with section 299F.852, and (3) the cigarettes have been marked
in accordance with section 299F.853.
    (b) Testing of cigarettes must be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing
and Materials (ASTM) Standard E2187-04, "Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition
Strength of Cigarettes."
   (c) Testing must be conducted on ten layers of filter paper.
    (d) No more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial in accordance with this section
may exhibit full-length burns. Forty replicate tests comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette
tested.
    (e) The performance standard required by this subdivision must only be applied to a complete
test trial.
   (f) Written certifications must be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been
accredited pursuant to standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO), or other comparable accreditation standard required by the state fire marshal.
    (g) Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a quality
control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the repeatability
of the testing results. The repeatability value must be no greater than 0.19.
    (h) This subdivision does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent with
sections 299F.850 to 299F.859 for any other purpose.
   (i) Testing performed or sponsored by the state fire marshal to determine a cigarette's compliance
with the performance standard required must be conducted in accordance with this section.
    Subd. 2. Permeability bands. Each cigarette listed in a certification submitted pursuant to
section 299F.852 that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance
62ND DAY]                              FRIDAY, MAY 4, 2007                                         3055

with the performance standard set forth in this section must have at least two nominally identical
bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. At least one complete band must be located
at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For cigarettes on which the bands are
positioned by design, there must be at least two bands fully located at least 15 millimeters from the
lighting end and ten millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column, or ten millimeters from
the labeled end of the tobacco column for nonfiltered cigarettes.
    Subd. 3. Equivalent test methods. A manufacturer of a cigarette that the state fire marshal
determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in subdivision 1,
paragraph (b), shall propose a test method and performance standard for the cigarette to the
state fire marshal. Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the state
fire marshal that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the
performance standard prescribed in subdivision 1, paragraph (d), the manufacturer may employ
such test method and performance standard to certify the cigarette pursuant to section 299F.852. If
the state fire marshal determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity
standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained
in this subdivision, and the state fire marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing
those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard
for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that
state's law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this subdivision, then the state fire
marshal shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance
standard to certify that cigarette for sale in this state, unless the state fire marshal demonstrates
a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under sections 299F.850 to
299F.859. All other applicable requirements of this section apply to the manufacturer.
    Subd. 4. Civil penalty. Each manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests
conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for a period of three years, and shall make copies of
these reports available to the state fire marshal and the attorney general upon written request. Any
manufacturer who fails to make copies of these reports available within 60 days of receiving a
written request is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day after the 60th day
that the manufacturer does not make such copies available.
    Subd. 5. Future ASTM Standards. The state fire marshal may, by written order published in
the State Register, adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition
Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the
percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when compared to the percentage of
full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM Standard
E2187-04 and the performance standard in subdivision 1, paragraph (d). A determination by the
state fire marshal under this subdivision is exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14,
and section 14.386 does not apply.
    Subd. 6. Report to legislature. The state fire marshal shall review the effectiveness of
this section and report findings every three years to the legislature and, if appropriate, make
recommendations for legislation to improve the effectiveness of this section. The report and
legislative recommendations must be submitted no later than January 2 of each three-year period.
    Subd. 7. Inventory before state standards. The requirements of subdivision 1 do not prohibit
wholesale or retail dealers from selling their existing inventory of cigarettes on or after the effective
date of this section if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed
3056                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [62ND DAY

to the cigarettes before the effective date of this section, and if the wholesale or retail dealer can
establish that the inventory was purchased before the effective date of this section in comparable
quantity to the inventory purchased during the same period of the previous year.
   Subd. 8. Implementation. This section must be implemented in accordance with the
implementation and substance of the New York "Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes."
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the first day of the 19th month following the date
of its final enactment.
   Sec. 12. [299F.852] CERTIFICATION AND PRODUCT CHANGE.
    Subdivision 1. Attestation. Each manufacturer shall submit to the state fire marshal a written
certification attesting that each cigarette listed in the certification:
   (1) has been tested in accordance with section 299F.851; and
   (2) meets the performance standard set forth in section 299F.851, subdivision 1, paragraph (d).

and approved for sale in New York pursuant to the New York "Fire Safety Standards for Cigarettes."
Proposed markings are deemed approved if the state fire marshal fails to act within ten business days

the security of the personal information and prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of the
information. For purposes of this paragraph, "personal information" is any individually identifiable
information gathered in connection with a record under paragraph (a).

    Subd. 5. Native prairie. "Native prairie" means land that has never been plowed where native
prairie vegetation originating from the site currently predominates or, if disturbed, is predominantly
covered with native prairie vegetation that originated from the site. Unbroken pasture land used
for livestock grazing can be considered native prairie if it has predominantly native vegetation
originating from the site and conservation practices have maintained biological diversity.
   Subd. 6. Native prairie species of a local ecotype. "Native prairie species of a local ecotype"
means a genetically differentiated population of a species that has at least one trait (morphological,
biochemical, fitness, or phenological) that is evolutionarily adapted to local environmental
conditions, notably plant competitors, pathogens, pollinators, soil microorganisms, growing season
length, climate, hydrology, and soil.
    Subd. 7. Restored native prairie. "Restored native prairie" means a restoration using at least
25 representative and biologically diverse native prairie plant species of a local ecotype originating
in the same county as the restoration site or within 25 miles of the county's border, but not across
the boundary of an ecotype region.
   Subd. 8. Restored prairie. "Restored prairie" means a restoration using at least 25 representative
and biologically diverse native prairie plant species originating from the same ecotype region in
which the restoration occurs.

   (1) the water contains a population of an aquatic invasive species that could spread to other
waters if use of the water and related activities are not regulated to prevent this; or
    (2) the water is highly likely to be infested by an aquatic invasive species because it is connected
to a water that contains a population of an aquatic invasive species.
   (b) When determining which invasive species comprise infested waters, the commissioner shall
consider:
   (1) the extent of a species distribution within the state;
   (2) the likely means of spread for a species; and
   (3) whether regulations specific to infested waters containing a specific species will effectively
reduce that species' spread.
   (c) The presence of common carp and curly-leaf pondweed shall not be the basis for designating
a water as infested.

the permit and of monitoring the activities allowed by the permit. The commissioner may waive
the fee under this subdivision for a charitable organization. Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the
commissioner may, by written order published in the State Register, establish contest permit fees.
The fees are not subject to the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not
apply.
    (b) If entry fees are over $25 per person, or total prizes are valued at more than $25,000, and if
the applicant has either:
   (1) not previously conducted a fishing contest requiring a permit under this subdivision; or
    (2) ever failed to make required prize awards in a fishing contest conducted by the applicant,
the commissioner may require the applicant to furnish the commissioner evidence of financial
responsibility in the form of a surety bond or bank letter of credit in the amount of $25,000.
   (c) The permit fee for any individual contest may not exceed the following amounts:
   (1) $120 for an open water contest not exceeding 100 participants and without off-site weigh-in;
   (2) $400 for an open water contest with more than 100 participants and without off-site weigh-in;
   (3) $500 for an open water contest not exceeding 100 participants with off-site weigh-in;
   (4) $1,000 for an open water contest with more than 100 participants with off-site weigh-in; or
   (5) $120 for an ice fishing contest with more than 150 participants.

    Subd. 2. License required. A person may not take fish from a dark house or fish house that is
left unattended on the ice overnight unless the house is licensed and has a license tag attached to
the exterior in a readily visible location, except as provided in this subdivision. The commissioner
must issue a tag with a dark house or fish house license, marked with a number to correspond with
the license and the year of issue. A dark house or fish house license is not required of a resident on
boundary waters where the adjacent state does not charge a fee for the same activity.

   Sec. 103. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 12. Authority to issue penalty orders. (a) The board may issue an order requiring
violations to be corrected and administratively assessing monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per
violation for violations of this chapter and chapters 103C, 103D, 103E, 103F, and 103G, any rules
adopted under those chapters, and any standards, limitations, or conditions established by the board.
   (b) Administrative penalties issued under paragraph (a) may be appealed according to section
116.072, if the recipient of the penalty requests a hearing by notifying the commissioner in writing
within 30 days after receipt of the order. For the purposes of this section, the terms "commissioner"
and "agency" as used in section 116.072 mean the board. If a hearing is not requested within the
30-day period, the order becomes a final order not subject to further review.
   (c) Administrative penalty orders issued under paragraph (a) may be enforced under section
116.072, subdivision 9. Penalty amounts must be remitted within 30 days of issuance of the order.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 104. [103B.102] LOCAL WATER MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND
OVERSIGHT.
    Subdivision 1. Findings; improving accountability and oversight. The legislature finds that
a process is needed to monitor the performance and activities of local water management entities.
The process should be preemptive so that problems can be identified early and systematically.
Underperforming entities should be provided assistance and direction for improving performance
in a reasonable time frame.
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, "local water management entities"
means watershed districts, soil and water conservation districts, metropolitan water management
organizations, and counties operating separately or jointly in their role as local water management
authorities under chapter 103B, 103C, 103D, or 103G and chapter 114D.
    Subd. 3. Evaluation and report. The Board of Water and Soil Resources shall evaluate
performance, financial, and activity information for each local water management entity. The board
shall evaluate the entities' progress in accomplishing their adopted plans on a regular basis, but not
less than once every five years. The board shall maintain a summary of local water management
entity performance on the board's Web site. Beginning February 1, 2008, and annually thereafter,
the board shall provide an analysis of local water management entity performance to the chairs of
the house and senate committees having jurisdiction over environment and natural resources policy.
    Subd. 4. Corrective actions. (a) In addition to other authorities, the Board of Water and Soil
Resources may, based on its evaluation in subdivision 3, reduce, withhold, or redirect grants and
other funding if the local water management entity has not corrected deficiencies as prescribed in a
notice from the board within one year from the date of the notice.
   (b) The board may defer a decision on a termination petition filed under section 103B.221,
103C.225, or 103D.271 for up to one year to conduct or update the evaluation under subdivision
3 or to communicate the results of the evaluation to petitioners or to local and state government
agencies.

makes a purchase by credit card that is not approved by the supervisors, the officer or employee is
personally liable for the amount of the purchase. A purchase by credit card must otherwise comply
with all statutes, rules, or soil and water conservation district policy applicable to soil and water
conservation district purchases.

buffer strips of perennial vegetation approved by the drainage authority or side inlet controls, or
both, adjacent to a public drainage ditch, where necessary to control erosion and sedimentation,
improve water quality, or maintain the efficiency of the drainage system. Preference should be
given to planting native species of a local ecotype. The approved perennial vegetation shall not
impede future maintenance of the ditch. The permanent strips of perennial vegetation shall be
16-1/2 feet in width measured outward from the top edge of the existing constructed channel.
Drainage system rights-of-way for the acreage and additional property required for the permanent
strips must be acquired by the authority having jurisdiction.

project, and filed with the auditor or watershed district. Within 30 days after the damages statement
is filed, the auditor or watershed district shall prepare property owners' reports according to section
103E.323, subdivision 1, clauses (1), (2), (6), (7), and (8), and mail a copy of the property owner's
report and damages statement to each owner of property affected by the proposed project.
   (d) After a damages statement is filed, the drainage authority shall set a time, by order, not more
than 30 days after the date of the order, for a hearing on the project. At least ten days before the
hearing, the auditor or watershed district shall give notice by mail of the time and location of the
hearing to the owners of property and political subdivisions likely to be affected by the project.
    (e) The drainage authority shall make findings and order the repairs to be made if the drainage
authority determines from the evidence presented at the hearing and by the viewers and engineer,
if appointed, that the repairs are necessary for the drainage system and the costs of the repairs are
within the limitations of section 103E.705.

    (b) The drainage authority may determine the cost of the repair per mile of open ditch on the
ditch system. Property that is in violation of the grass requirement shall be assessed a cost of 20
percent of the repair cost per open ditch mile multiplied by the length of open ditch in miles on the
property in violation.
    (c) After the amount of the additional assessment is determined and applied to the repair cost,
the balance of the repair cost may be apportioned pro rata as provided in subdivision 1.
   Sec. 119. [103F.518] REINVEST IN MINNESOTA CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment of program. (a) The board, in consultation with the technical
committee established in subdivision 11, shall establish and administer a reinvest in Minnesota
(RIM) clean energy program that is in addition to the program under section 103F.515. Selection
of land for the clean energy program must be based on its potential benefits for bioenergy crop
production, water quality, soil health, reduction of chemical inputs, soil carbon storage, biodiversity,
and wildlife habitat.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, "diverse native prairie" means a prairie planted from a mix
of local Minnesota native prairie species. A selection from all available native prairie species may
be made so as to match species appropriate to local site conditions.
   Subd. 2. Eligible land. Eligible land under this section must:
   (1) be owned by the landowner, or a parent or other blood relative of the landowner, for at least
one year before the date of application;
   (2) be at least five acres in size;
   (3) not be currently set aside, enrolled, or diverted under another federal or state government

program; and
    (4) have been in agricultural use, as defined in section 17.81, subdivision 4, or have been set
aside, enrolled, or diverted under another federal or state program for at least two of the last five
years before the date of application.
    Subd. 3. Designation of project areas. The board shall develop a process to designate defined
project areas. The designation process shall prioritize projects that include coordinated cooperation
of a cellulosic biofuel facility or a bioenergy production facility, target impaired waters, or support
other state or local natural resource plans, goals, or objectives.
    Subd. 4. Easements. The board may acquire, or accept by gift or donation, easements on eligible
land. An easement may be permanent or of limited duration. An easement of limited duration may
not be acquired if it is for a period less than 20 years. The negotiation and acquisition of easements
authorized by this section are exempt from the contractual provisions of chapters 16B and 16C.
      Subd. 5. Nature of property rights acquired. (a) An easement must prohibit:
      (1) agricultural crop production, unless approved by the board for energy production purposes;
and
   (2) spraying with chemicals, except as necessary to comply with noxious weed control laws,
emergency pest control necessary to protect public health, or as needed to establish a productive
planting as determined by the technical committee under subdivision 11.
      (b) An easement is subject to the terms of the agreement provided in subdivision 6.
   (c) Agricultural crop production and harvest are limited to native, perennial bioenergy crops.
Harvest shall occur outside of bird nesting season.
    (d) An easement must allow repairs, improvements, and inspections necessary to maintain public
drainage systems provided the easement area is restored to the condition required by the terms of
the easement.
   (e) An easement may allow nonnative perennial prairie or pasture established by September 1,
2007, that meet the other objectives outlined in subdivision 7.
   (f) An easement may allow grazing of livestock only if practiced under a plan, approved by the
board, that protects water quality, wildlife habitat, and biodiversity.
    Subd. 6. Agreements by landowner. The board may enroll eligible land in the reinvest in
Minnesota clean energy program by signing an agreement in recordable form with a landowner
in which the landowner agrees:
      (1) to convey to the state an easement that is not subject to any prior title, lien, or encumbrance;
    (2) to seed the land subject to the easement, as specified in the agreement, at seeding rates
determined by the board, or carry out other long-term capital improvements approved by the board;
and
      (3) that the easement duration may be lengthened through mutual agreement with the board.
      Subd. 7. Payments for easements. The board must develop a tiered payment system for
62ND DAY]                              FRIDAY, MAY 4, 2007                                        3141

easements partially based on the benefits of the bioenergy crop production for water quality, soil
health, reduction in chemical inputs, soil carbon storage, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat using
cash rent or a similar system as may be determined by the board. The payment system must provide
that the highest per-acre payment is for diverse native prairie and perennials.
    Subd. 8. Easement renewal. When an easement of limited duration expires, a new easement and
agreement for an additional period of not less than 20 years may be acquired by agreement of the
board and the landowner under the terms of this section. The board may adjust payment rates as a
result of renewing an agreement and easement only after examining the condition of the established
plantings, conservation practices, and land values.
    Subd. 9. Correction of easement boundary lines. To correct errors in legal descriptions for
easements that affect the ownership interest in the state and adjacent landowners, the board may,
in the name of the state, with the approval of the attorney general, convey, without consideration,
interests of the state necessary to correct legal descriptions of boundaries. The conveyance must be
by quitclaim deed or release in a form approved by the attorney general.
    Subd. 10. Enforcement and damages. (a) A landowner who violates the term of an easement
or agreement under this section, or induces, assists, or allows another to do so, is liable to the state
for treble damages if the trespass is willful, but liable for double damages only if the trespass is not
willful. The amount of damages is the amount needed to make the state whole or the amount the
landowner has gained due to the violation, whichever is greater.
    (b) Upon the request of the board, the attorney general may commence an action for specific
performances, injunctive relief, damages, including attorney fees, and any other appropriate relief
to enforce this section in district court in the county where all or part of the violation is alleged to
have been committed, or where the landowner resides or has a principal place of business.
    Subd. 11. Technical committee. To ensure that public benefits, including water quality, soil
health, reduction of chemical inputs, soil carbon storage, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat are
secured along with bioenergy crop production, the Board of Water and Soil Resources shall appoint
a technical committee consisting of one representative from the Departments of Agriculture,
Natural Resources, and Commerce and the Pollution Control Agency; two farm organizations;
one sustainable agriculture farmer organization; three rural economic development organizations;
three environmental organizations; and three conservation or wildlife organizations. The board and
technical committee shall consult with private sector organizations and University of Minnesota
researchers involved in biomass establishment and bioenergy or biofuel conversion. The technical
committee is to develop program guidelines and standards, as appropriate to ensure that reinvest in
Minnesota clean energy program contracts provide public benefits commensurate with the public
investment. The technical committee shall review and make recommendations on the guidelines
and standards every five years.
   Sec. 120. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under a
replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a local
governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by the
board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481, under
a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. Mining

reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the
local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (e),
the local government unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at
least ten years unless the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local
government unit may require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk
of conversion to a nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity
to a municipality or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill stormwater
management, and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter unless the design includes pretreatment of runoff and the pond is
functioning as a wetland.

previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    ­
    (­)
     i­ (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.
    ­j­ (k) This section and sections 103G.223 to 103G.2242, 103G.2364, and 103G.2365 apply to
    (­)
the state and its departments and agencies.
    ­
    (k
     ­­) (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish
credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph.
    ­
    (­)
      l­ (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in
the filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on-site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
   Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,

delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.

on the basis of its percentage of presettlement wetlands remaining. After receipt of satisfactory
documentation from the local government, the board shall change the classification of a county
or watershed. If requested by the local government unit, the board must assist in developing the
documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.

transportation projects, except that wetlands affected in less than 50 percent areas must be replaced
in less than 50 percent areas, and wetlands affected in the seven-county metropolitan area must be
replaced at a ratio of two to one in: (i) the affected county or, (ii) in another of the seven metropolitan
counties, or (iii) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially within the seven-county
metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the seven-county metropolitan
area.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in greater than 80 percent areas
may follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) by wetland banking after evaluating on-site
replacement and replacement within the watershed; (2) replaced in an adjacent wetland bank service
area if wetland bank credits are not reasonably available in the same wetland bank service area as
the affected wetland, as determined by a comprehensive inventory approved by the board; and (3)
statewide.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in the seven-county metropolitan
area must follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) in the affected county; (2) in another of
the seven metropolitan counties; or (3) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially
within the seven-county metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the
seven-county metropolitan area.
    (d) The exception in paragraph (a), clause ­(5
                                                 ­­) (6), does not apply to replacement completed
using wetland banking credits established by a person who submitted a complete wetland banking
application to a local government unit by April 1, 1996.
    ­
    (­) (e) When reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities
     c­
are not available in siting priorities listed in paragraph (a), the applicant may seek opportunities at
the next level.
   ­(d
     ­­) (f) For the purposes of this section, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial
replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
    (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.

    Subd. 2. Drainage. (a) For the purposes of this subdivision, "public drainage system" means
a drainage system as defined in section 103E.005, subdivision 12, and any ditch or tile lawfully
connected to the drainage system.
   (b) A replacement plan is not required for draining of type 1 wetlands, or up to five acres of type
2 or 6 wetlands, in an unincorporated area on land that has been assessed drainage benefits for a
public drainage system, provided that:
      (1) during the 20-year period that ended January 1, 1992:
    (i) there was an expenditure made from the drainage system account for the public drainage
system;
      (ii) the public drainage system was repaired or maintained as approved by the drainage authority;
or
   (iii) no repair or maintenance of the public drainage system was required under section 103E.705,
subdivision 1, as determined by the public drainage authority; and
      (2) the wetlands are not drained for conversion to:
      (i) platted lots;
      (ii) planned unit, commercial, or industrial developments; or
    (iii) any development with more than one residential unit per 40 acres, except for parcels subject

same 40 acres.
If wetlands drained under this paragraph are converted to uses prohibited under clause (2) during
the ten-year period following drainage, the wetlands must be replaced under section 103G.222.
    (c) A replacement plan is not required for draining or filling of wetlands, except for draining types
3, 4, and 5 wetlands that have been in existence for more than 25 years, resulting from maintenance
and repair of existing public drainage systems.
    (d) A replacement plan is not required for draining or filling of wetlands, except for draining
wetlands that have been in existence for more than 25 years, resulting from maintenance and repair
of existing drainage systems other than public drainage systems.

   (e) A replacement plan is not required for draining agricultural land that: (1) was planted with
annually seeded crops before July 5, except for crops that are normally planted after that date, in
eight out of the ten most recent years prior to the impact; (2) was in a crop rotation seeding of pasture
grass, cover crop, or legumes, or was fallow for a crop production purpose, in eight out of the ten
most recent years prior to the impact; or (3) was enrolled in a state or federal land conservation
program and met the requirements of clause (1) or (2) before enrollment.
    (f) The public drainage authority may, as part of the repair, install control structures, realign the
ditch, construct dikes along the ditch, or make other modifications as necessary to prevent drainage
of the wetland.
    (g) Wetlands of all types that would be drained as a part of a public drainage repair project are
eligible for the permanent wetlands preserve under section 103F.516. The board shall give priority
to acquisition of easements on types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands that have been in existence for more than
25 years on public drainage systems and other wetlands that have the greatest risk of drainage from
a public drainage repair project.

    Subd. 2a. Wetland boundary or type determination. (a) A landowner may apply for a wetland
boundary or type determination from the local government unit. The landowner applying for the
determination is responsible for submitting proof necessary to make the determination, including,
but not limited to, wetland delineation field data, observation well data, topographic mapping, survey
mapping, and information regarding soils, vegetation, hydrology, and groundwater both within and
outside of the proposed wetland boundary.
    (b) A local government unit that receives an application under paragraph (a) may seek the
advice of the Technical Evaluation Panel as described in subdivision 2, and, if necessary, expand
the Technical Evaluation Panel. The local government unit may delegate the decision authority
for wetland boundary or type determinations w ­­t

establish other procedures it considers appropriate.
    (c) The local government unit decision must be made in compliance with section 15.99.
Within ten calendar days of the decision, the local government unit decision must be mailed to
the landowner, members of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the watershed district or watershed
management organization, if one exists, and individual members of the public who request a copy.
    (d) Appeals of decisions made by designated local government staff must be made to the local
government unit. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a ruling on an appeal must be made by
the local government unit within 30 days from the date of the filing of the appeal.
   (e) The local government unit decision is valid for three years unless the Technical Evaluation
Panel determines that natural or artificial changes to the hydrology, vegetation, or soils of the area
have been sufficient to alter the wetland boundary or type.

returned to the petitioner. Appeal may be made by:
   (1) the wetland owner;
   (2) any of those to whom notice is required to be mailed under subdivision 7; or
   (3) 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.
   (b) Within 30 days after receiving a petition, the board shall decide whether to grant the petition
and hear the appeal. The board shall grant the petition unless the board finds that:
   (1) the appeal is meritless, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay;
   (2) the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies;
   (3) expanded technical review is needed;
   (4) the local government unit's record is not adequate; or
   (5) the petitioner has not posted a letter of credit, cashier's check, or cash if required by the local
government unit.
    (c) In determining whether to grant the appeal, the board shall also consider the size of the
wetland, other factors in controversy, any patterns of similar acts by the local government unit or
petitioner, and the consequences of the delay resulting from the appeal.
    (d) All appeals must be heard by the committee for dispute resolution of the board, and a decision
made within 60 days of filing the local government unit's record and the written briefs submitted for
the appeal. The decision must be served by mail on the parties to the appeal, and is not subject to
the provisions of chapter 14. A decision whether to grant a petition for appeal and a decision on the
merits of an appeal must be considered the decision of an agency in a contested case for purposes
of judicial review under sections 14.63 to 14.69.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the board shall establish a fee schedule to defray the
administrative costs of appeals made to the board under this subdivision. Fees established under
this authority shall not exceed $1,000. Establishment of the fee is not subject to the rulemaking
process of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.

credit as determined by the local government unit, including enrollment in a statewide wetlands
bank:
    (1) reestablishment of permanent native, noninvasive vegetative cover on a wetland on
agricultural land that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation seeding of
pasture grasses or legumes, or was in a land retirement program during the past ten years;
   (2) buffer areas of permanent native, noninvasive vegetative cover established or preserved on
upland adjacent to replacement wetlands;
    (3) wetlands restored for conservation purposes under terminated easements or contracts; and
    (4) water quality treatment ponds constructed to pretreat storm water runoff prior to discharge
to wetlands, public waters, or other water bodies, provided that the water quality treatment ponds
must be associated with an ongoing or proposed project that will impact a wetland and replacement
credit for the treatment ponds is based on the replacement of wetland functions and on an approved
stormwater management plan for the local government.

informed consent used for the program must meet the informed consent protocols developed by the
National Institutes of Health;
    (3) educational and outreach materials that are culturally appropriate for dissemination to
program participants and communities. Priority shall be given to the development of materials
specifically designed to ensure that parents are informed about all of the benefits of breastfeeding
so that the program does not result in an unjustified fear of toxins in breast milk, which might
inadvertently lead parents to avoid breastfeeding. The materials shall communicate relevant
scientific findings; data on the accumulation of pollutants to community health; and the required
responses by local, state, and other governmental entities in regulating toxicant exposures;
   (4) a training program that is culturally sensitive specifically for health care providers, health
educators, and other program administrators;
   (5) a designation process for state and private laboratories that are qualified to analyze
biospecimens and report the findings; and

timber offered at the public sale and not sold may thereafter be sold at private sale by the county
auditor at not less than the appraised value thereof, until the time as the county board may withdraw
the timber from sale. The appraised value of the timber and the forestry practices to be followed in
the cutting of said timber shall be approved by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (b) Payment of the full sale price of all timber sold on tax-forfeited lands shall be made in cash at
the time of the timber sale, except in the case of oral or sealed bid auction sales, the down payment
shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised value, and the balance shall be paid prior to entry.
In the case of auction sales that are partitioned and sold as a single sale with predetermined cutting
blocks, the down payment shall be no less than 15 percent of the appraised price of the entire timber
sale which may be held until the satisfactory completion of the sale or applied in whole or in part
to the final cutting block. The value of each separate block must be paid in full before any cutting
may begin in that block. With the permission of the county contract administrator the purchaser
may enter unpaid blocks and cut necessary timber incidental to developing logging roads as may
be needed to log other blocks provided that no timber may be removed from an unpaid block until
separately scaled and paid for. If payment is provided as specified in this paragraph as security
under paragraph (a) and no cutting has taken place on the contract, the county auditor may credit
the security provided, less any down payment required for an auction sale under this paragraph, to
any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under this chapter to which the contract
holder requests in writing that it be credited, provided the request and transfer is made within the
same calendar year as the security was received.

timber, including biomass, as appraised or scaled. Any parcels of land from which timber is to be
sold by scale of cut products shall be so designated in the published notice of sale under paragraph
(a), in which case the notice shall contain a description of the parcels, a statement of the estimated
quantity of each species of timber, and the appraised price of each species of timber for 1,000 feet,
per cord or per piece, as the case may be. In those cases any bids offered over and above the appraised
prices shall be by percentage, the percent bid to be added to the appraised price of each of the
different species of timber advertised on the land. The purchaser of timber from the parcels shall
pay in cash at the time of sale at the rate bid for all of the timber shown in the notice of sale as
estimated to be standing on the land, and in addition shall pay at the same rate for any additional
amounts which the final scale shows to have been cut or was available for cutting on the land at
the time of sale under the terms of the sale. Where the final scale of cut products shows that less
timber was cut or was available for cutting under terms of the sale than was originally paid for, the
excess payment shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the purchaser,
to be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county. No
timber, except hardwood pulpwood, may be removed from the parcels of land or other designated
landings until scaled by a person or persons designated by the county board and approved by the
commissioner of natural resources. Landings other than the parcel of land from which timber is
cut may be designated for scaling by the county board by written agreement with the purchaser of
the timber. The county board may, by written agreement with the purchaser and with a consumer
designated by the purchaser when the timber is sold by the county auditor, and with the approval
of the commissioner of natural resources, accept the consumer's scale of cut products delivered at
the consumer's landing. No timber shall be removed until fully paid for in cash. Small amounts of
timber not exceeding $3,000 in appraised valuation may be sold for not less than the full appraised
value at private sale to individual persons without first publishing notice of sale or calling for bids,
provided that in case of a sale involving a total appraised value of more than $200 the sale shall be

made subject to final settlement on the basis of a scale of cut products in the manner above provided
and not more than two of the sales, directly or indirectly to any individual shall be in effect at one
time.
    (d) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, and at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for use as cottage and camp sites
and for agricultural purposes and for the purpose of taking and removing of hay, stumpage, sand,
gravel, clay, rock, marl, and black dirt from the land, and for garden sites and other temporary uses
provided that no leases shall be for a period to exceed ten years; provided, further that any leases
involving a consideration of more than $12,000 per year, except to an organized subdivision of the
state shall first be offered at public sale in the manner provided herein for sale of timber. Upon
the sale of any leased land, it shall remain subject to the lease for not to exceed one year from the
beginning of the term of the lease. Any rent paid by the lessee for the portion of the term cut off by
the cancellation shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the lessee, to
be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county.
    (e) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations, or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for the purpose of taking and
removing for use for road construction and other purposes tax-forfeited stockpiled iron-bearing
material. The county auditor must determine that the material is needed and suitable for use in
the construction or maintenance of a road, tailings basin, settling basin, dike, dam, bank fill, or
other works on public or private property, and that the use would be in the best interests of the
public. No lease shall exceed ten years. The use of a stockpile for these purposes must first be
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. The request shall be deemed approved unless
the requesting county is notified to the contrary by the commissioner of natural resources within
six months after receipt of a request for approval for use of a stockpile. Once use of a stockpile has
been approved, the county may continue to lease it for these purposes until approval is withdrawn
by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (f) The county auditor, with the approval of the county board is authorized to grant permits,
licenses, and leases to tax-forfeited lands for the depositing of stripping, lean ores, tailings, or waste
products from mines or ore milling plants, upon the conditions and for the consideration and for the
period of time, not exceeding 15 years, as the county board may determine. The permits, licenses,
or leases are subject to approval by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (g) Any person who removes any timber from tax-forfeited land before said timber has been
scaled and fully paid for as provided in this subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (h) The county auditor may, with the approval of the county board, and without first offering
at public sale, grant leases, for a term not exceeding 25 years, for the removal of peat and for
the production or removal of farm-grown closed-loop biomass as defined in section 216B.2424,
subdivision 1, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands upon the terms and conditions
as the county board may prescribe. Any lease for the removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop
biomass, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands must first be reviewed and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources if the lease covers 320 or more acres. No lease for the
removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop biomass, or short-rotation woody crops shall be made by
the county auditor pursuant to this section without first holding a public hearing on the auditor's

intention to lease. One printed notice in a legal newspaper in the county at least ten days before the
hearing, and posted notice in the courthouse at least 20 days before the hearing shall be given of the
hearing.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c) to the contrary, the St. Louis County auditor
may, at the discretion of the county board, sell timber to the party who bids the highest price for all
the several kinds of timber, as provided for sales by the commissioner of natural resources under
section 90.14. Bids offered over and above the appraised price need not be applied proportionately
to the appraised price of each of the different species of timber.
    (j) In lieu of any payment or deposit required in paragraph (b), as directed by the county board
and under terms set by the county board, the county auditor may accept an irrevocable bank letter
of credit in the amount equal to the amount otherwise determined in paragraph (b). If an irrevocable
bank letter of credit is provided under this paragraph, at the written request of the purchaser, the
county may periodically allow the bank letter of credit to be reduced by an amount proportionate
to the value of timber that has been harvested and for which the county has received payment. The
remaining amount of the bank letter of credit after a reduction under this paragraph must not be less
than 20 percent of the value of the timber purchased. If an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash
deposit is provided for the down payment required in paragraph (b), and no cutting of timber has
taken place on the contract for which a letter of credit has been provided, the county may allow the
transfer of the letter of credit to any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under
this chapter to which the contract holder requests in writing that it be credited.

and active monitoring of forest pests, and gaps in the adequacy of the current oversight and detection
system;
    (2) how the state may establish a flexible, yet comprehensive, system of tree monitoring so that
trees in all areas of Minnesota will be covered by active early pest detection efforts. In analyzing
this, the task force shall consider possible roles for certified tree inspectors, volunteers, and state
and local government;
   (3) current storm damage response and how that might be improved for forest health and to
minimize vulnerability to pest infection;

government programs in which eligibility is defined as household income at or below 50 percent
of state median income is deemed to be automatically eligible for protection under this section and
no other verification of income may be required.
    Subd. 7. Prohibitions and requirements. (a) This subdivision applies during the cold weather
period.
    (b) A utility may not charge a deposit or delinquency charge to a customer who has entered into
a payment agreement or a customer who has appealed to the commission under subdivision 8.
   (c) A utility may not disconnect service during the following periods:
   (1) during the pendency of any appeal under subdivision 8;
   (2) earlier than ten working days after a utility has deposited in first class mail, or seven working
days after a utility has personally served, the notice required under subdivision 4 to a customer in
an occupied dwelling;
    (3) earlier than ten working days after the utility has deposited in first class mail the notice
required under subdivision 4 to the recorded billing address of the customer, if the utility has
reasonably determined from an on-site inspection that the dwelling is unoccupied;
   (4) on a Friday, unless the utility makes personal contact with, and offers a payment agreement
consistent with this section to the customer;
   (5) on a Saturday, Sunday, holiday, or the day before a holiday;
   (6) when utility offices are closed;
   (7) when no utility personnel are available to resolve disputes, enter into payment agreements,
accept payments, and reconnect service; or
   (8) when commission offices are closed.
    (d) A utility may not discontinue service until the utility investigates whether the dwelling is
actually occupied. At a minimum, the investigation must include one visit by the utility to the
dwelling during normal working hours. If no contact is made and there is reason to believe that
the dwelling is occupied, the utility must attempt a second contact during nonbusiness hours. If
personal contact is made, the utility representative must provide notice required under subdivision
4 and, if the utility representative is not authorized to enter into a payment agreement, the telephone
number the customer can call to establish a payment agreement.
    (e) Each utility must reconnect utility service if, following disconnection, the dwelling is found to
be occupied and the customer agrees to enter into a payment agreement or appeals to the commission
because the customer and the utility are unable to agree on a payment agreement.
   Subd. 8. Disputes; customer appeals. (a) A utility must provide the customer and any
designated third party with a commission-approved written notice of the right to appeal:
  (1) a utility determination that the customer's household income is more than 50 percent of state
median household income; or
   (2) when the utility and customer are unable to agree on the establishment or modification of a

payment agreement.
    (b) A customer's appeal must be filed with the commission no later than seven working days
after the customer's receipt of a personally served appeal notice, or within ten working days after
the utility has deposited a first class mail appeal notice.
   (c) The commission must determine all customer appeals on an informal basis, within 20
working days of receipt of a customer's written appeal. In making its determination, the commission
must consider one or more of the factors in subdivision 6.
     (d) Notwithstanding any other law, following an appeals decision adverse to the customer,
a utility may not disconnect utility heating service for seven working days after the utility has
personally served a disconnection notice, or for ten working days after the utility has deposited a
first class mail notice. The notice must contain, in easy-to-understand language, the date on or after
which disconnection will occur, the reason for disconnection, and ways to avoid disconnection.
    Subd. 8a. Cooperative and municipal disputes. Complaints in connection with utility heating
service during the cold weather period filed against a municipal or a cooperative electric association
with the commission under section 216B.17, subdivision 6 or 6a, are governed by section 216B.097.
    Subd. 9. Customers above 50 percent of state median income. During the cold weather period,
a customer whose household income is above 50 percent of state median income:
    (1) has the right to a payment agreement that takes into consideration any extenuating
circumstances of the household; and
   (2) may not be disconnected and must be reconnected if the customer makes timely payments
under a payment agreement accepted by a utility.
Subdivision 7, paragraph (b), does not apply to customers whose household income is above 50
percent of state median income.
     Subd. 10. Reporting. Annually on November 1, a utility must electronically file with the
commission a report, in a format specified by the commission, specifying the number of utility
heating service customers whose service is disconnected or remains disconnected for nonpayment
as of October 1 and October 15. If customers remain disconnected on October 15, a utility must
file a report each week between November 1 and the end of the cold weather period specifying:
    (1) the number of utility heating service customers that are or remain disconnected from service
for nonpayment; and
    (2) the number of utility heating service customers that are reconnected to service each week.
The utility may discontinue weekly reporting if the number of utility heating service customers that
are or remain disconnected reaches zero before the end of the cold weather period.
The data reported under this subdivision are presumed to be accurate upon submission and must be
made available through the commission's electronic filing system.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.097, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Application; notice to residential customer. (a) A municipal utility or a
cooperative electric association must not disconnect and must reconnect the utility service of a

caused the undercharge. The agreement must cover a period equal to the time over which the
undercharge occurred or a different time period that is mutually agreeable to the customer and the
utility, except that the duration of a payment agreement offered by a utility to a customer whose
household income is at or below 50 percent of state median household income must consider the
financial circumstances of the customer's household.

a lack of compensation would present financial hardship to the intervenor. Compensation may not
exceed $50,000 for a single intervenor in any proceeding. For the purpose of this subdivision,
"materially assisted" means that the intervenor's participation and presentation was useful and
seriously considered, or otherwise substantially contributed to the commission's deliberations in
the proceeding.
    (c) In determining whether an intervenor has materially assisted the commission's deliberation,
the commission must consider, among other factors, whether:
    (1) the intervenor represented an interest that would not otherwise have been adequately
represented;
   (2) the evidence or arguments presented or the positions taken by the intervenor were an
important factor in producing a fair decision;
     (3) the intervenor's position promoted a public purpose or policy;
  (4) the evidence presented, arguments made, issues raised, or positions taken by the intervenor
would not have been a part of the record without the intervenor's participation; and
   (5) the administrative law judge or the commission adopted, in whole or in part, a position
advocated by the intervenor.
    (d) In determining whether the absence of compensation would present financial hardship to the
intervenor, the commission must consider:
   (1) whether the costs presented in the intervenor's claim reflect reasonable fees for attorneys and
expert witnesses and other reasonable costs; and
     (2) the ratio between the costs of intervention and the intervenor's unrestricted funds.
    (e) An intervenor seeking compensation must file a request and an affidavit of service with the
commission, and serve a copy of the request on each party to the proceeding. The request must be
filed 30 days after the later of (1) the expiration of the period within which a petition for rehearing,
amendment, vacation, reconsideration, or reargument must be filed or (2) the date the commission
issues an order following rehearing, amendment, vacation, reconsideration, or reargument.

   (f) The compensation request must include:
    (1) the name and address of the intervenor or representative of the nonprofit organization the
intervenor is representing;
   (2) proof of the organization's nonprofit, tax-exempt status;
   (3) the name and docket number of the proceeding for which compensation is requested;
    (4) a list of actual annual revenues and expenses of the organization the intervenor is representing
for the preceding year and projected revenues, revenue sources, and expenses for the current year;
   (5) the organization's balance sheet for the preceding year and a current monthly balance sheet;
   (6) an itemization of intervenor costs and the total compensation request; and
    (7) a narrative explaining why additional organizational funds cannot be devoted to the
intervention.
    (g) Within 30 days after service of the request for compensation, a party may file a response,
together with an affidavit of service, with the commission. A copy of the response must be served
on the intervenor and all other parties to the proceeding.
   (h) Within 15 days after the response is filed, the intervenor may file a reply with the commission.
A copy of the reply and an affidavit of service must be served on all other parties to the proceeding.
   (i) If additional costs are incurred as a result of additional proceedings following the
commission's initial order, the intervenor may file an amended request within 30 days after the
commission issues an amended order. Paragraphs (e) to (h) apply to an amended request.
   (j) The commission must issue a decision on intervenor compensation within 60 days of a filing
by an intervenor.
   (k) A party may request reconsideration of the commission's compensation decision within 30
days of the decision.
    (l) If the commission issues an order requiring payment of intervenor compensation, the utility
that was the subject of the proceeding must pay the compensation to the intervenor, and file with
the commission proof of payment, within 30 days after the later of (1) the expiration of the period
within which a petition for reconsideration of the commission's compensation decision must be filed
or (2) the date the commission issues an order following reconsideration of its order on intervenor
compensation.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.16, subdivision 15, is amended to read:
    Subd. 15. Low-income affordability programs. (a) The commission m       ­­ay
                                                                               ­ must consider ability
to pay as a factor in setting utility rates and may establish affordability programs for low-income
residential ratepayers in order to ensure affordable, reliable, and continuous service to low-income
utility customers. By September 1, 2007, a public utility serving low-income residential ratepayers
who use natural gas for heating must file an affordability program with the commission. For
purposes of this subdivision, "low-income residential ratepayers" means ratepayers who receive
energy assistance from the low-income home energy assistance program (LIHEAP).

    (c) The commission must issue orders necessary to implement, administer, and evaluate
affordability programs, and to allow a utility to recover program costs, including administrative
costs, on a timely basis. The commission may not allow a utility to recover administrative costs,
excluding start-up costs, in excess of five percent of total program costs, or program evaluation
costs in excess of two percent of total program costs. The commission must permit deferred
accounting, with carrying costs, for recovery of program costs incurred during the period between
general rate cases.
   (d) Public utilities may use information collected or created for the purpose of administering
energy assistance to administer affordability programs.
  Sec. 20. [216B.1637] RECOVERY OF CERTAIN LIMITED UTILITY GREENHOUSE
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.
     A public utility that owns a nuclear power plant and a public utility furnishing gas service may
file for recovery of investments and expenses associated with the replacement of cast iron natural
gas distribution and service lines owned by the utility and to replace breakers that contain sodium
hexafluoride in order to reduce the risk of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.
Upon a finding that the projects are consistent with the public interest and do not impose excessive
costs on customers, the commission shall provide timely recovery of the utility's investment and
expenses on any approved projects through a rate adjustment mechanism similar to that provided
for transmission projects under section 216B.16, subdivision 7b, paragraphs (b) to (d).
    Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.241, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
62ND DAY]                                              FRIDAY, MAY 4, 2007                                                                 3201

    Subd. 6. Renewable energy research. (a) A public utility that owns a nuclear generation
facility in the state shall spend five percent of the total amount that utility is required to spend under
this section to support basic and applied research and demonstration activities at the University of
Minnesota Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment for the development of renewable
energy sources and technologies. The utility shall transfer the required amount to the University
of Minnesota on or before July 1 of each year and that annual amount shall be deducted from the
amount of money the utility is required to spend under this section. The University of Minnesota
shall transfer at least ten percent of these funds to at least one rural campus or experiment station.

performance standards and systems modeling must be completed to predict commercial
performance, risk, and synergies. In addition, the proposed pilots should meet as many of the
following criteria as possible:
   (1) advance energy security;
   (2) capitalize on the state's native resources;
   (3) result in economically competitive infrastructure being put in place;
   (4) be located where it will link well with existing and related projects and be accessible to the
public, now or in the future;
   (5) demonstrate multiple, integrated aspects of renewable hydrogen infrastructure;
   (6) include an explicit public education and awareness component;
   (7) be scalable to respond to changing circumstances and market demands;
   (8) draw on firms and expertise within the state where possible;
   (9) include an assessment of its economic, environmental, and social impact; and
   (10) serve other needs beyond hydrogen development.
   Sec. 23. [216B.813] MINNESOTA RENEWABLE HYDROGEN INITIATIVE.
    Subdivision 1. Road map. The Department of Commerce shall coordinate and administer
directly or by contract the Minnesota renewable hydrogen initiative. If the department decides to
contract for its duties under this section, it must contract with a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization
within the state to develop the road map. The initiative may be run as a public-private partnership
representing business, academic, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations. The initiative
must oversee the development and implementation of a renewable hydrogen road map, including

appropriate technology deployments, that achieve the hydrogen goal of section 216B.013. The
road map should be compatible with the United States Department of Energy's National Hydrogen
Energy Roadmap and be based on an assessment of marketplace economics and the state's
opportunities in hydrogen, fuel cells, and related technologies, so as to capitalize on strengths. The
road map should establish a vision, goals, general timeline, strategies for working with industry,
and measurable milestones for achieving the state's renewable hydrogen goal. The road map should
describe how renewable hydrogen and fuel cells fit in Minnesota's overall energy system, and
should help foster a consistent, predictable, and prudent investment environment. The department
must report to the legislature on the progress in implementing the road map by November 1 of
each odd-numbered year.
    Subd. 2. Grants. (a) The commissioner of commerce shall operate a competitive grant program
for projects to assist the state in attaining its renewable hydrogen energy goals. The commissioner
of commerce shall assemble an advisory committee made up of industry, university, government,
and nongovernment organizations to:
   (1) help identify the most promising technology deployment projects for public investment;
   (2) advise on the technical specifications for those projects; and
   (3) make recommendations on project grants.
    (b) The commissioner shall give preference to project concepts included in the department's
most recent biennial report: Strategic Demonstration Projects to Accelerate the Commercialization
of Renewable Hydrogen and Related Technologies in Minnesota. Projects eligible for funding must
combine one or more of the hydrogen production options listed in the department's report with an
end use that has significant commercial potential, preferably high visibility, and relies on fuel cells
or related technologies. Each funded technology deployment must include an explicit education
and awareness-raising component, be compatible with the renewable hydrogen deployment criteria
defined in section 216B.812, and receive 50 percent of its total cost from nonstate sources. The 50
percent requirement does not apply for recipients that are public institutions.

   Sec. 27. [216C.385] CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCE TEAMS.
    Subdivision 1. Findings. The legislature finds that community-based energy programs are
an effective means of implementing improved energy practices including conservation, greater
efficiency in energy use, and the production and use of renewable resources such as wind, solar,
biomass, and biofuels. Further, community-based energy programs are found to be a public purpose
for which public money may be spent.
    Subd. 2. Mission, organization, and membership. The clean energy resource teams (CERT's)
project is an innovative state, university, and nonprofit partnership that serves as a catalyst for
community energy planning and projects. The mission of CERT's is to give citizens a voice in the
energy planning process by connecting them with the necessary technical resources to identify
and implement community-scale renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In 2003, the
Department of Commerce designated the CERT's project as a statewide collaborative venture
and recognized six regional teams based on their geography: Central, Northeast, Northwest,
Southeast, Southwest, and West-Central. Membership of CERT's may include but is not limited
to representatives of utilities; federal, state, and local governments; small business; labor; senior
citizens; academia; and other interested parties. The Department of Commerce may certify
additional clean energy resource teams by regional geography, including teams in the Twin Cities
metropolitan area.

vegetation to prevent its collection in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide; and
   (2) "geologic carbon sequestration" means injecting carbon dioxide into underground geologic
formations where it can be stored for long periods of time to prevent its escape to the atmosphere.
   Sec. 35. TERRESTRIAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION ACTIVITIES.
    Subdivision 1. Study; scope. The Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota is requested
to conduct a study assessing the potential capacity for carbon sequestration in Minnesota's terrestrial
systems. The study must:
    (1) conduct a statewide inventory and construct a database of lands across several land types,
such as forests, agricultural lands, peatlands, and wetlands, that have the potential to sequester
significant quantities of carbon and of lands that currently contain large stocks of carbon that are at
risk of being emitted to the atmosphere as a result of changes in land use and climate;
    (2) quantify the ability of various land use practices, such as the growth of different species of
crops, grasses, and trees, to sequester carbon and their impacts on other ecological services of value,
including air and water quality, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat;
    (3) identify a network of benchmark monitoring sites to measure the impact of long-term,
large-scale factors, such as changes in climate, carbon dioxide levels, and land use, on the terrestrial
carbon sequestration capacity of various land types, to improve understanding of carbon-terrestrial
interactions and dynamics;
   (4) identify long-term demonstration projects to measure the impact of deliberate sequestration
practices, including the establishment of biofuel production systems, on forest, agricultural, wetland,
and prairie ecosystems; and
   (5) evaluate current state policies and programs that affect the levels of terrestrial sequestration
on public and private lands and identify gaps and recommend policy changes to increase
sequestration rates.
    Subd. 2. Coordination of terrestrial carbon sequestration activities. Planning and
implementation of the study described in subdivision 1 will be coordinated by the Minnesota
Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration Initiative, a task force consisting of representatives from the
University of Minnesota, the Department of Agriculture, the Board of Water and Soil Resources,
the Department of Commerce, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Pollution Control
Agency and agricultural, forestry, conservation, and business stakeholders.

assessing the potential capacity for geologic carbon sequestration in the Midcontinent Rift system
in Minnesota. The study must assess the potential of porous and permeable sandstone layers deeper
than one kilometer below the surface that are capped by less permeable shale and must identify
potential risks to carbon storage, such as areas of low permeability in injection zones, low storage
capacity, and potential seal failure. The study must identify the most promising formations and
geographic areas for physical analysis of carbon sequestration potential. The study must review
geologic maps, published reports and surveys, and any relevant unpublished raw data with respect
to attributes that are pertinent for the long-term sequestration of carbon in geologic formations,
in particular, those that bear on formation injectivity, capacity, and seal effectiveness. The study
must examine the following characteristics of key sedimentary units within the Midcontinent Rift
system in Minnesota:
   (1) likely depth, temperature, and pressure;
   (2) physical properties, including the ability to contain and transmit fluids;
   (3) the type of rocks present;
   (4) structure and geometry, including folds and faults; and
   (5) hydrogeology, including water chemistry and water flow.
    (b) The commissioner of natural resources, in consultation with the Minnesota Geological
Survey, shall contract for a study to estimate the properties of the Midcontinent Rift system in
Minnesota, as described in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (5), through the use of computer models
developed for similar geologic formations located outside of Minnesota which have been studied
in greater detail.

initial registration or renew an existing registration. Revocation of or refusal to renew a registration

   Subdivision 1. Records retention. Every registrant must keep, and use in the registrant's
business, such books, accounts, and records, including electronic records, as will enable the
commissioner to determine whether the registrant is complying with this chapter and of the rules,
orders, and directives adopted by the commissioner under this chapter. Every registrant must
preserve such books, accounts, and records for at least six years after making the final entry on
any transaction recorded therein. Examinations of the books, records, and method of operations

    Subd. 2. Statements to debtors. Each registrant must maintain and must make available records

debtor. A statement showing amounts received from the debtor, disbursements to each creditor,
amounts which any creditor has agreed to accept as payment in full for any debt owed the creditor
by the debtor, charges deducted by the registrant, and such other information as the commissioner

debtor to the registrant.
    Subd. 2. Monthly maintenance fee. The registrant may charge a periodic fee for account
maintenance or other purposes, but only if the fee is reasonable for the services provided and does
not exceed the lesser of 15 percent of the monthly payment amount or $75.
   Subd. 3. Additional fees unauthorized. A registrant may not impose any fee or other charge or
3246                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [62ND DAY

receive any funds or other payment other than the initial fee or monthly maintenance fee authorized
by this section.
    Subd. 4. Amount of periodic payments retained. The registrant may retain as payment for
the fees authorized by this section no more than 15 percent of any periodic payment made to the
registrant by the debtor. The remaining 85 percent must be disbursed to listed creditors under and
in accordance with the debt management services agreement. No fees or charges may be received
or retained by the registrant for any handling of recurring payments. Recurring payments include
current rent, mortgage, utility, telephone, maintenance as defined in section 518.27, child support,
insurance premiums, and such other payments as the commissioner may by rule prescribe.
    Subd. 5. Advance payments. No fees or charges may be received or retained for any payments
by the debtor made more than the following number of days in advance of the date specified in the
debt management services agreement on which they are due: (1) 42 days in the case of contracts
requiring monthly payments; (2) 15 days in the case of agreements requiring biweekly payments; or
(3) seven days in the case of agreements requiring weekly payments. For those agreements which do
not require payments in specified amounts, a payment is deemed an advance payment to the extent
it exceeds twice the average regular payment previously made by the debtor under that contract.
This subdivision does not apply when the debtor intends to use the advance payments to satisfy
future payment of obligations due within 30 days under the contract. This subdivision supersedes
any inconsistent provision of this chapter.
   Subd. 6. Consent of creditors. A registrant must actively seek to obtain the consent of all
creditors to the debt management services plan set forth in the debt management services agreement.
Consent by a creditor may be express and in writing, or may be evidenced by acceptance of a
payment made under the debt management services plan set forth in the contract. The registrant
must notify the debtor within ten days after any failure to obtain the required consent and of the
debtor's right to cancel without penalty. The notice must be in a form as the commissioner shall
prescribe. Nothing contained in this section is deemed to require the return of any origination fee
and any fees earned by the registrant prior to cancellation or default.
    Subd. 7. Withdrawal of creditor. Whenever a creditor withdraws from a debt management
services plan, or refuses to participate in a debt management services plan, the registrant must
promptly notify the debtor of the withdrawal or refusal. In no case may this notice be provided
more than 15 days after the debt management services provider learns of the creditor's decision to
withdraw from or refuse to participate in a plan. This notice must include the identity of the creditor
withdrawing from the plan, the amount of the monthly payment to that creditor, and the right of the
debtor to cancel the agreement under section 332A.11.
    Subd. 8. Payments held in trust. The registrant must maintain a separate trust account and
deposit in the account all payments received from the moment that they are received, except that
the registrant may commingle the payment with the registrant's own property or funds, but only to
the extent necessary to ensure the maintenance of a minimum balance if the financial institution
at which the trust account is held requires a minimum balance to avoid the assessment of fees or
penalties for failure to maintain a minimum balance. All disbursements, whether to the debtor or to
the creditors of the debtor, or to the registrant, must be made from such account.
   Subd. 9. Timely payment of creditors. The registrant must disburse any funds paid by or on
behalf of a debtor to creditors of the consumer within 42 days after receipt of the funds, or earlier if

necessary to comply with the due date in the agreement between the debtor and the creditor, unless
the reasonable payment of one or more of the debtor's obligations requires that the funds be held
for a longer period so as to accumulate a sum certain, or where the debtor's payment is returned for
insufficient funds or other reason that makes the withholding of such payments in the net interest of
the debtor.

within, the metropolitan area, and (2) to ensure that rail transit lines will interface with each other
and other transportation facilities and services so as to provide a unified, integrated, and efficient
multimodal transportation system.
   Subd. 4. Expenditure of state funds. No state funds may be expended by the Metropolitan
Council to study a particular light rail transit or commuter rail facility unless the funds are
appropriated in legislation that identifies the route, including the origin and destination.

items in the preliminary design plan and the preliminary engineering plan for the facilities proposed
but with greater detail and specificity needed for construction. The final design plan must include,
at a minimum:
    (1) final plans for the physical design of facilities, including the right-of-way definition;
environmental impacts and mitigation measures; intermodal coordination with bus operations and
routes; and civil engineering plans for vehicles, track, stations, parking, and access, including
disability access; and
    (2) final plans for civil engineering for electrification, communication, and other similar
facilities; operational rules, procedures, and strategies; capital costs; ridership; operating costs and

revenues, and sources of funds for operating subsidies; financing for construction and operation;
an implementation method; and other similar matters.
    The final design plan must be stated with sufficient particularity and detail to allow the proposer
to begin the acquisition and construction of operable facilities. If a design-build implementation
method is proposed, instead of civil engineering plans the final design plan must state detailed design
criteria and performance standards for the facilities.

    473.3994 LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT; DESIGN PLANS.
    Subd. 1a. Designation of responsible authority. For each proposed light rail transit facility in
the metropolitan area, the governor must designate either the Metropolitan Council or the state of
Minnesota acting through the commissioner of transportation as the entity responsible for planning,
designing, acquiring, constructing, and equipping the facility. For the purposes of this section and
section 473.3997, the term "responsible authority" means the entity designated by the governor for
a particular light rail transit facility. Notwithstanding such designation, the commissioner and the
council may enter into one or more cooperative agreements with respect to the planning, designing,
acquiring, constructing, or equipping of a particular light rail transit facility that provide for the
parties to exercise their respective authorities in support of the project in a manner that best serves
the project and the public.
