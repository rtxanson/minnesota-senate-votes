need determinations must be performed by a physician, a registered nurse working under direct
supervision of a physician, a physician's assistant, a nurse practitioner, a licensed practical nurse,
or a discharge planner. Nonemergency medical transportation level of need determinations must
not be performed more than semiannually on any individual, unless the individual's circumstances
have sufficiently changed so as to require a new level of need determination. Individuals residing
in licensed nursing facilities and individuals requiring stretcher transportation are exempt from a
level of need determination and are eligible for special transportation services until the individual
no longer resides in a licensed nursing facility or no longer requires stretcher transportation."

eligible for MinnesotaCare according to this section. All other provisions of sections 256L.01 to

unless otherwise specified.
    (b) Parents who enroll in the MinnesotaCare program must also enroll their children, if the
children are eligible. Children may be enrolled separately without enrollment by parents. However,
if one parent in the household enrolls, both parents must enroll, unless other insurance is available. If
one child from a family is enrolled, all children must be enrolled, unless other insurance is available.
If one spouse in a household enrolls, the other spouse in the household must also enroll, unless other
insurance is available. Families cannot choose to enroll only certain uninsured members.

payment rates determined under this section rather than section 256B.431, the commissioner shall
establish a rate under this subdivision. The nursing facility must enter into a written contract with
the commissioner.
    (b) A nursing facility's case mix payment rate for the first rate year of a facility's contract under
this section is the payment rate the facility would have received under section 256B.431.
    (c) A nursing facility's case mix payment rates for the second and subsequent years of a
facility's contract under this section are the previous rate year's contract payment rates plus an
inflation adjustment and, for facilities reimbursed under this section or section 256B.431, an
adjustment to include the cost of any increase in Health Department licensing fees for the facility
taking effect on or after July 1, 2001. The index for the inflation adjustment must be based on the
change in the Consumer Price Index-All Items (United States City average) (CPI-U) forecasted by
the commissioner of finance's national economic consultant, as forecasted in the fourth quarter of
the calendar year preceding the rate year. The inflation adjustment must be based on the 12-month
period from the midpoint of the previous rate year to the midpoint of the rate year for which the
rate is being determined. For the rate years beginning on July 1, 1999, July 1, 2000, July 1, 2001,

fees taking effect on or after July 1, 2001, shall be provided. Beginning in 2005, adjustment to the
property payment rate under this section and section 256B.431 shall be effective on October 1. In
determining the amount of the property-related payment rate adjustment under this paragraph, the
commissioner shall determine the proportion of the facility's rates that are property-related based
on the facility's most recent cost report.
    (d) The commissioner shall develop additional incentive-based payments of up to five percent
above a facility's operating payment rate for achieving outcomes specified in a contract. The
commissioner may solicit contract amendments and implement those which, on a competitive
basis, best meet the state's policy objectives. The commissioner shall limit the amount of any
incentive payment and the number of contract amendments under this paragraph to operate the
incentive payments within funds appropriated for this purpose. The contract amendments may
specify various levels of payment for various levels of performance. Incentive payments to facilities
under this paragraph may be in the form of time-limited rate adjustments or onetime supplemental
payments. In establishing the specified outcomes and related criteria, the commissioner shall
consider the following state policy objectives:
   (1) successful diversion or discharge of residents to the residents' prior home or other
community-based alternatives;
   (2) adoption of new technology to improve quality or efficiency;
   (3) improved quality as measured in the Nursing Home Report Card;

desirable."

OR ASSETS.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. The State Board of Investment, when requested by the city of
Duluth, may invest the funds or assets of the city's community investment trust fund in a special
account for that purpose in the combined investment funds established in section 11A.14, subject
to the policies and procedures established by the State Board of Investment. Use of the funds in the
account is restricted to debt service payments for the city's street improvement program or to any
other use approved in accordance with Section 54(E) of the home rule charter of the city of Duluth.
    Subd. 2. Account maintenance and investment. The city may deposit money in the account

   Sec. 2. [353.95] ACCOUNT FOR DULUTH POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment. The Public Employees Retirement Association may administer
an account representing the irrevocable trust fund established by the city of Duluth to be used
only to fund and pay for the postemployment benefits owed to retired employees in accordance
with language contained in labor agreements between the city and its employee bargaining units,
or between participating subgroups in the city's health plan and their retirees. The city of Duluth
investment committee shall serve as trustee of the irrevocable trust.

    Subd. 2. Definition. For purposes of this section, "postemployment benefit" means a benefit
giving rise to a liability under Statement 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, and
therefore does not include benefits to be paid by a Minnesota public pension plan listed in section
356.20, subdivision 2, or 356.30, subdivision 3, and benefits provided on a defined contribution
individual account basis.
   Subd. 3. Account maintenance and investment. (a) The Public Employees Retirement
Association may charge the city fees for reasonable administrative costs, and the amount of
those fees is appropriated to the association from the account. The Public Employees Retirement
Association may establish other terms and conditions for participation in the account.
    (b) The Public Employees Retirement Association must certify all money in the account to the
State Board of Investment for investment in the combined investment funds established in section
11A.14, subject to the policies and procedures established by the State Board of Investment.
Investment earnings must be credited to the account of the city. At least quarterly, the State Board
of Investment shall provide to the city of Duluth the total rate of return for the assets invested by
the board for the city of Duluth under this section. The State Board of Investment shall also include
in its annual report the annual total rate of return results for those assets.
    Subd. 4. Management and termination of account. The city may deposit money in the account
and may withdraw money from the account as needed for postemployment benefits owed on behalf
of retired employees of the city or its subgroups. Such transactions must be at a time and in a
manner required by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association. The
city of Duluth must ensure that the investment and management of the assets complies with the
prudent investor rule in section 501B.151 and that withdrawals comply with the requirements of
this section. The account may be terminated only to the extent the city's postemployment benefit
actuarial liability is satisfied or otherwise defeased. The city shall file with the state auditor an
investment policy statement under section 356.219, subdivision 3, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 5. Status of irrevocable fund. (a) All money in the account representing the irrevocable
fund created in this section is held in trust for the exclusive benefit of retired employees of the city
and of subgroups participating in the city's health plan, and is not subject to claims by creditors of the
state, the city, the city's subgroups, or the current and former employees of the city or its subgroups.
    (b) The irrevocable trust fund underlying the account created in this section must be deemed an
arrangement equivalent to a trust for all legal purposes.
    EFFECTIVE DATE; LOCAL APPROVAL. This section is effective the day following the
day on which the chief clerical officer of the city of Duluth timely completes its compliance with
Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021, subdivision 3, following approval by the Duluth City Council
in compliance with Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021, subdivision 2.
   Sec. 3. INTENT AND PURPOSE; NO PRECEDENT.
    (a) Sections 1 and 2 are intended to resolve specific expenditure and funding issues that have
arisen in the city of Duluth.
    (b) Nothing in sections 1 and 2 may be interpreted as establishing a precedent for potential
solutions to postemployment benefit expenditure and funding problems in other jurisdictions that
may be fashioned by the 2007 legislature."
