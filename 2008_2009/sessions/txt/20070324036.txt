   Page 14, after line 10, insert:
   "Sec. 4. [13.595] GRANTS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given them.
   (a) "Completion of the evaluation process" means that the granting agency has completed
negotiating the grant agreement with the selected grantee.
   (b) "Grant agreement" has the meaning given in section 16B.97, subdivision 1.
   (c) "Grantee" means a person that applies for or receives a grant.
   (d) "Granting agency" means the state government entity that provides the grant.
    (e) "Opened" means the act that occurs once the deadline for submitting a response to a proposal
to the granting agency has been reached.
    (f) "Request for proposal" means the data outlining the responsibilities the granting agency wants
the grantee to assume.
   (g) "Response" means the data submitted by a grantee as required by a request for proposal.
    Subd. 2. Request for applications. Data created by a granting agency to create a request for
proposal is classified as nonpublic until the request for proposal is published. To the extent that a
granting agency involves persons outside the granting agency to create the request for proposal, the
data remain nonpublic in the hands of all persons who may not further disseminate any data that are
created or reviewed as part of the request for proposal development. At publication, the data in the
request for proposal is public.
    Subd. 3. Responses to request for proposals. (a) Responses submitted by a grantee are private
or nonpublic until the responses are opened. Once the responses are opened, the name and address
of the grantee and the amount requested is public. All other data in a response is private or nonpublic
data until completion of the evaluation process. After a granting agency has completed the evaluation
process, all remaining data in the responses is public with the exception of trade secret data as defined
and classified in section 13.37. A statement by a grantee that the response is copyrighted or otherwise
protected does not prevent public access to the response.
36TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MARCH 24, 2007                                       1317

    (b) If all responses are rejected prior to completion of the evaluation process, all data, other
than that made public at the opening, remain private or nonpublic until a resolicitation of proposals
results in completion of the evaluation process or a determination is made to abandon the grant.
If the rejection occurs after the completion of the evaluation process, the data remain public. If a
resolicitation of proposals does not occur within one year of the grant opening date, the remaining
data become public.
   Subd. 4. Evaluation data. (a) Data created or maintained by a granting agency as part of the
evaluation process referred to in this section are protected nonpublic data until completion of the
evaluation process at which time the data are public with the exception of trade secret data as defined
and classified in section 13.37.
    (b) If a granting agency asks individuals outside the granting agency to assist with the
evaluation of the responses, the granting agency may share not public data in the responses with
those individuals. The individuals participating in the evaluation may not further disseminate the
not public data they review."
   Page 15, after line 17, insert:
   "Sec. 10. [16B.97] GRANTS MANAGEMENT.
   Subdivision 1. Grant agreement. (a) A grant agreement is a written instrument or electronic
document defining a legal relationship between a granting agency and a grantee when the principal
purpose of the relationship is to transfer cash or something of value to the recipient to support
a public purpose authorized by law instead of acquiring by professional or technical contract,
purchase, lease, or barter property or services for the direct benefit or use of the granting agency.
    (b) This section does not apply to capital project grants to political subdivisions as defined by
section 16A.86.
    Subd. 2. Grants governance. The commissioner shall provide leadership and direction for
policy related to grants management in Minnesota in order to foster more consistent, streamlined
interaction between executive agencies, funders, and grantees that will enhance access to grant
opportunities and information and lead to greater program accountability and transparency. The
commissioner has the duties and powers stated in this section. An executive agency must do what
the commissioner requires under this section.
   Subd. 3. Discretionary powers. The commissioner has the authority to:
   (1) review grants management practices and propose policy and procedure improvements to the
governor, legislature, executive agencies, and the federal government;
   (2) sponsor, support, and facilitate innovative and collaborative grants management projects with
public and private organizations;
   (3) review, recommend, and implement alternative strategies for grants management;
   (4) collect and disseminate information, issue reports relating to grants management, and sponsor
and conduct conferences and studies; and

   Subd. 4. Duties. (a) The commissioner shall:
    (1) create general grants management policies and procedures that are applicable to all executive
agencies. The commissioner may approve exceptions to these policies and procedures for particular
grant programs. Exceptions shall expire or be renewed after five years. Executive agencies shall
retain management of individual grants programs;
   (2) provide a central point of contact concerning statewide grants management policies and
procedures;
   (3) serve as a resource to executive agencies in such areas as training, evaluation, collaboration,
and best practices in grants management;
    (4) ensure grants management needs are considered in the development, upgrade, and use of
statewide administrative systems and leverage existing technology wherever possible;
    (5) oversee and approve future professional and technical service contracts and other information
technology spending related to executive agency grants management activities;
   (6) provide a central point of contact for comments about executive agencies violating statewide
grants governance policies and about fraud and waste in grants processes;
    (7) forward received comments to the appropriate agency for further action, and may follow up
as necessary;
    (8) provide a single listing of all available executive agency competitive grant opportunities and
resulting grant recipients;
   (9) selectively audit executive agency grants to ensure funds are spent as intended;
   (10) selectively review development and implementation of executive agency grants, policies,
and practices; and
   (11) selectively review executive agency compliance with best practices.
   (b) The commissioner may determine that it is cost-effective for agencies to develop and use
shared grants management technology systems. This system would be governed under section
16E.01, subdivision 3, paragraph (b).
   Sec. 11. [16B.98] GRANTS MANAGEMENT PROCESS.
    Subdivision 1. Limitation. As a condition of receiving a grant from an appropriation of state
funds, the recipient of the grant must agree to minimize administrative costs. The granting agency
is responsible for negotiating appropriate limits to these costs so that the state derives the optimum
benefit for grant funding.
    Subd. 2. Ethical practices and conflict of interest. An employee of the executive branch
involved directly or indirectly in grants processes, at any level, is subject to the code of ethics in
section 43A.38.
    Subd. 3. Conflict of interest. (a) The commissioner must develop policies regarding code of
ethics and conflict of interest designed to prevent conflicts of interest for employees, committee
members, or others involved in the recommendation, awarding, and administration of grants. The
36TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MARCH 24, 2007                                       1319

policies must apply to employees who are directly or indirectly in the grants process, which may
include the following:
      (1) developing request for proposals or evaluation criteria;
      (2) drafting, recommending, awarding, amending, revising, or entering into grant agreements;
      (3) evaluating or monitoring performance; or
      (4) authorizing payments.
      (b) The policies must include:
    (1) a process to make all parties to the grant aware of policies and laws relating to conflict of
interest, and training on how to avoid and address potential conflicts; and
  (2) a process under which those who have a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest
must disclose the matter.
    (c) If the employee, appointing authority, or commissioner determines that a conflict of interest
exists, the matter shall be assigned to another employee who does not have a conflict of interest. If it
is not possible to assign the matter to an employee who does not have a conflict of interest, interested
personnel shall be notified of the conflict and the employee may proceed with the assignment.
    Subd. 4. Reporting of violations. A state employee who discovers evidence of violation of
laws or rules governing grants is encouraged to report the violation or suspected violation to the
employee's supervisor, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, or the legislative auditor.
The legislative auditor shall report to the Legislative Audit Commission if there are multiple
complaints about the same agency. The auditor's report to the Legislative Audit Commission under
this section must disclose only the number and type of violations alleged. An employee making
a good faith report under this section has the protections provided for under section 181.932,
prohibiting the employer from discriminating against the employee.
    Subd. 5. Creation and validity of grant agreements. (a) A grant agreement is not valid and
the state is not bound by the grant unless:
      (1) the grant has been executed by the head of the agency or a delegate who is party to the grant;
and
    (2) the accounting system shows an encumbrance for the amount of the grant in accordance with
policy approved by the commissioner.
    (b) The combined grant agreement and amendments must not exceed five years without specific,
written approval by the commissioner according to established policy, procedures, and standards,
or unless the commissioner determines that a longer duration is in the best interest of the state.
    (c) A fully executed copy of the grant agreement with all amendments and other required records
relating to the grant must be kept on file at the granting agency for a time equal to that required of
grantees in subdivision 8.
   (d) Grant agreements must comply with policies established by the commissioner for minimum
grant agreement standards and practices.
1320                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [36TH DAY

    (e) The attorney general may periodically review and evaluate a sample of state agency grants
to ensure compliance with applicable laws.
   Subd. 6. Grant administration. A granting agency shall diligently administer and monitor any
grant it has entered into.
    Subd. 7. Grant payments. Payments to the grantee may not be issued until the grant agreement
is fully executed.
    Subd. 8. Audit. (a) A grant agreement made by an executive agency must include an audit
clause that provides that the books, records, documents, and accounting procedures and practices
of the grantee or other party that are relevant to the grant or transaction are subject to examination
by the granting agency and either the legislative auditor or the state auditor, as appropriate, for a
minimum of six years from the grant agreement end date, receipt and approval of all final reports,
or the required period of time to satisfy all state and program retention requirements, whichever is
later. If a grant agreement does not include an express audit clause, the audit authority under this
subdivision is implied.
    (b) If the granting agency is a local unit of government, and the governing body of the local unit of
government requests that the state auditor examine the books, records, documents, and accounting
procedures and practices of the grantee or other party according to this subdivision, the granting
agency shall be liable for the cost of the examination. If the granting agency is a local unit of
government, and the grantee or other party requests that the state auditor examine all books, records,
documents, and accounting procedures and practices related to the grant, the grantee or other party
that requested the examination shall be liable for the cost of the examination.
    Subd. 9. Authority of attorney general. The attorney general may pursue remedies available
by law to avoid the obligation of an agency to pay under a grant or to recover payments made
if activities under the grant are so unsatisfactory, incomplete, or inconsistent that payment would
involve unjust enrichment. The contrary opinion of the granting agency does not affect the power
of the attorney general under this subdivision.
   Subd. 10. Grants with Indian tribes and bands. Notwithstanding any other law, an agency
may not require an Indian tribe or band to deny its sovereignty as a requirement or condition of a
grant with an agency."

                         MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS - CONTINUED

   Without objection, remaining on the Order of Business of Motions and Resolutions, the Senate
reverted to the Orders of Business of Reports of Committees and Second Reading of Senate Bills.

                                    REPORTS OF COMMITTEES

   Senator Pogemiller moved that the Committee Reports at the Desk be now adopted. The motion
prevailed.

   Senator Moua from the Committee on Judiciary, to which was re-referred
   S.F. No. 310: A bill for an act relating to human services; expanding the definition of chemically
dependent person; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, sections 253B.02, subdivision 2; 626.5561,
subdivisions 1, 2; repealing Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.5563.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Page 1, after line 19, insert:
   "Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.065, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Early intervention criteria. (a) A court shall order early intervention treatment of a
proposed patient who meets the criteria under paragraph (b) or (c). The early intervention treatment
must be less intrusive than long-term inpatient commitment and must be the least restrictive
treatment program available that can meet the patient's treatment needs.
    (b) The court shall order early intervention treatment if the court finds all of the elements of the
following factors by clear and convincing evidence:
   (1) the proposed patient is mentally ill;
   (2) the proposed patient refuses to accept appropriate mental health treatment; and
    (3) the proposed patient's mental illness is manifested by instances of grossly disturbed behavior
or faulty perceptions and either:
    (i) the grossly disturbed behavior or faulty perceptions significantly interfere with the proposed
patient's ability to care for self and the proposed patient, when competent, would have chosen
substantially similar treatment under the same circumstances; or
    (ii) due to   the mental illness, the proposed patient received court-ordered inpatient treatment
under section     253B.09 at least two times in the previous three years; the patient is exhibiting
symptoms or        behavior substantially similar to those that precipitated one or more of the
court-ordered     treatments; and the patient is reasonably expected to physically or mentally
deteriorate to    the point of meeting the criteria for commitment under section 253B.09 unless
treated.
  For purposes of this paragraph, a proposed patient who was released under section 253B.095 and
whose release was not revoked is not considered to have received court-ordered inpatient treatment

under section 253B.09.
    (c) The court may order early intervention treatment if the court finds by clear and convincing
evidence that a pregnant woman is a chemically dependent person. A chemically dependent person
for purposes of this section is a woman who has during pregnancy engaged in excessive use, for
a nonmedical purpose, of controlled substances or their derivatives, alcohol, or inhalants that will
pose a substantial risk of damage to the brain or physical development of the fetus.

                                 ญhญ paragraphs (b) and (c), none of the following constitute a refusal
to accept appropriate mental health treatment:
   (1) a willingness to take medication but a reasonable disagreement about type or dosage;
   (2) a good-faith effort to follow a reasonable alternative treatment plan, including treatment as
specified in a valid advance directive under chapter 145C or section 253B.03, subdivision 6d;
   (3) an inability to obtain access to appropriate treatment because of inadequate health care
coverage or an insurer's refusal or delay in providing coverage for the treatment; or
   (4) an inability to obtain access to needed mental health services because the provider will only
accept patients who are under a court order or because the provider gives persons under a court
order a priority over voluntary patients in obtaining treatment and services."
   Renumber the sections in sequence
   Amend the title numbers accordingly
   And when so amended the bill do pass. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

the following requirements:
    (a) Premium rates must be no more than 25 percent above and no more than 25 percent below
the index rate charged to individuals for the same or similar coverage, adjusted pro rata for rating
periods of less than one year. The premium variations permitted by this paragraph must be based only
upon health status, claims experience, and occupation. For purposes of this paragraph, health status
includes refraining from tobacco use or other actuarially valid lifestyle factors associated with good
health, provided that the lifestyle factor and its effect upon premium rates have been determined by
the commissioner to be actuarially valid and have been approved by the commissioner. Variations

permitted under this paragraph must not be based upon age or applied differently at different ages.
This paragraph does not prohibit use of a constant percentage adjustment for factors permitted to
be used under this paragraph.
    (b) Premium rates may vary based upon the ages of covered persons only as provided in this
paragraph. In addition to the variation permitted under paragraph (a), each health carrier may use
an additional premium variation based upon age of up to plus or minus 50 percent of the index rate.
    (c) A health carrier may request approval by the commissioner to establish separate geographic
regions determined by the health carrier and to establish separate index rates for each such region.
The commissioner shall grant approval if the following conditions are met:
    (1) the geographic regions must be applied uniformly by the health carrier;
   (2) each geographic region must be composed of no fewer than seven counties that create a
contiguous region; and
    (3) the health carrier provides actuarial justification acceptable to the commissioner for the
proposed geographic variations in index rates, establishing that the variations are based upon
differences in the cost to the health carrier of providing coverage.
    (d) Health carriers may use rate cells and must file with the commissioner the rate cells they use.
Rate cells must be based upon the number of adults or children covered under the policy and may
reflect the availability of Medicare coverage. The rates for different rate cells must not in any way
reflect generalized differences in expected costs between principal insureds and their spouses.
   (e) In developing its index rates and premiums for a health plan, a health carrier shall take into
account only the following factors:
    (1) actuarially valid differences in rating factors permitted under paragraphs (a) and (b); and
   (2) actuarially valid geographic variations if approved by the commissioner as provided in
paragraph (c).
   (f) All premium variations must be justified in initial rate filings and upon request of
the commissioner in rate revision filings. All rate variations are subject to approval by the
commissioner.
   (g) The loss ratio must comply with the section 62A.021 requirements for individual health
plans.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (g), the rates must not be approved, unless the
commissioner has determined that the rates are reasonable. In determining reasonableness,

to the calendar year or years that the proposed premium rate would be in effect, and shall consider
actuarially valid changes in risks associated with the enrollee populations, and actuarially valid
changes as a result of statutory changes in Laws 1992, chapter 549.
    (i) An insurer may, as part of a minimum lifetime loss ratio guarantee filing under section
62A.02, subdivision 3a, include a rating practices guarantee as provided in this paragraph. The
rating practices guarantee must be in writing and must guarantee that the policy form will be

offered, sold, issued, and renewed only with premium rates and premium rating practices that
comply with subdivisions 2, 3, 4, and 5. The rating practices guarantee must be accompanied by an
actuarial memorandum that demonstrates that the premium rates and premium rating system used
in connection with the policy form will satisfy the guarantee. The guarantee must guarantee refunds
of any excess premiums to policyholders charged premiums that exceed those permitted under
subdivision 2, 3, 4, or 5. An insurer that complies with this paragraph in connection with a policy
form is exempt from the requirement of prior approval by the commissioner under paragraphs (c),
(f), and (h).
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Premium growth limits. (a) For calendar year 2008 and each year thereafter, the
commissioner shall set annual premium growth limits for health plan companies. The premium
limits set by the commissioner for calendar years 2008 to 2013 shall not exceed the regional
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers for the preceding calendar year plus two percentage
points and an additional one percentage point to be used to finance the implementation of the
electronic medical record system described under section 62J.495. The commissioner shall ensure
that the additional percentage point is being used to provide financial assistance to health care
providers to implement electronic medical record systems either directly or through an increase in
reimbursement.
    (b) For the calendar years beyond 2013, the rate of premium growth shall be limited to the
change in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers for the previous calendar year plus two
percentage points. The commissioners of health and commerce shall make a recommendation to
the legislature by January 15, 2012, regarding the continuation of the additional percentage point
to the growth limit described in paragraph (a). The recommendation shall be based on the progress
made by health care providers in instituting an electronic medical record system and in creating a
statewide interactive electronic health record system.
    (c) The commissioner may add additional percentage points as needed to the premium limit for
a calendar year if a major disaster, bioterrorism, or a public health emergency occurs that results
in higher health care costs. Any additional percentage points must reflect the additional cost to the
health care system directly attributed to the disaster or emergency.
   (d) The commissioner shall publish the annual premium growth limits in the State Register by
January 31 of the year that the limits are to be in effect.
    (e) For the purposes of this subdivision, premium growth is measured as the percentage change
in per member, per month premium revenue from the current year to the previous year. Premium
growth rates shall be calculated for the following lines of business: individual, small group, and
large group. Data used for premium growth rate calculations shall be submitted as part of the cost
containment filing under section 62J.38.
   (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "health plan company" has the meaning given in section
62J.041.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Cost containment duties. The commissioner shall:
   (1) establish statewide and regional cost containment goals for total health care spending

under this section and collect data as described in sections 62J.38 to 62J.41 to monitor statewide
achievement of the cost containment goals and premium growth limits;
    (2) divide the state into no fewer than four regions, with one of those regions being the
Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan statistical area but excluding Chisago, Isanti, Wright, and
Sherburne Counties, for purposes of fostering the development of regional health planning and
coordination of health care delivery among regional health care systems and working to achieve
the cost containment goals;
   (3) monitor the quality of health care throughout the state and take action as necessary to ensure
an appropriate level of quality;
    (4) issue recommendations regarding uniform billing forms, uniform electronic billing
procedures and data interchanges, patient identification cards, and other uniform claims and
administrative procedures for health care providers and private and public sector payers. In
developing the recommendations, the commissioner shall review the work of the work group on
electronic data interchange (WEDI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) at the
national level, and the work being done at the state and local level. The commissioner may adopt
rules requiring the use of the Uniform Bill 82/92 form, the National Council of Prescription Drug
Providers (NCPDP) 3.2 electronic version, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 1500
form, or other standardized forms or procedures;
   (5) undertake health planning responsibilities;
    (6) authorize, fund, or promote research and experimentation on new technologies and health
care procedures;
    (7) within the limits of appropriations for these purposes, administer or contract for statewide
consumer education and wellness programs that will improve the health of Minnesotans and
increase individual responsibility relating to personal health and the delivery of health care
services, undertake prevention programs including initiatives to improve birth outcomes, expand
childhood immunization efforts, and provide start-up grants for worksite wellness programs;
   (8) undertake other activities to monitor and oversee the delivery of health care services in
Minnesota with the goal of improving affordability, quality, and accessibility of health care for all
Minnesotans; and
   (9) make the cost containment goal and premium growth limit data available to the public in a
consumer-oriented manner.

changes in basic benefits, and legislative initiatives that materially change health care costs, as long
as these adjustments are consistent with the methodology submitted by the health plan company to
the commissioner, and approved by the commissioner as actuarially justified. T                                                                  ญญ hญeญญm ญญ   t ญo

health plan company reserves and net worth as established under chapters 60A, 62C, 62D, 62H,
and 64B, with respect to the health plan companies that each commissioner respectively regulates
to assess the degree to which savings resulting from the establishment of cost containment goals are
passed on to consumers in the form of lower premium rates.
    (b) Health plan companies shall fully reflect in the premium rates the savings generated by
the cost containment goals. No premium rate, currently reviewed by the Department of Health
or Commerce, may be approved for those health plan companies unless the health plan company
establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner of commerce or the commissioner of health, as
appropriate, that the proposed new rate would comply with this paragraph.
    (c) Health plan companies, except those licensed under chapter 60A to sell accident and sickness
insurance under chapter 62A, shall annually before the end of the fourth fiscal quarter provide to the
commissioner of health or commerce, as applicable, a projection of the level of reserves the company
expects to attain during each quarter of the following fiscal year. These health plan companies
shall submit with required quarterly financial statements a calculation of the actual reserve level
attained by the company at the end of each quarter including identification of the sources of any
significant changes in the reserve level and an updated projection of the level of reserves the health
plan company expects to attain by the end of the fiscal year. In cases where the health plan company
has been given a certificate to operate a new health maintenance organization under chapter 62D, or
been licensed as a community integrated service network under chapter 62N, or formed an affiliation
with one of these organizations, the health plan company shall also submit with its quarterly financial
statement, total enrollment at the beginning and end of the quarter and enrollment changes within
each service area of the new organization. The reserve calculations shall be maintained by the
commissioners as trade secret information, except to the extent that such information is also required
to be filed by another provision of state law and is not treated as trade secret information under such
other provisions.
