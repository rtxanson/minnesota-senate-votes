a retention election shall be ineligible to be nominated to fill the resulting vacancy.
    (c) A judge seeking to retain judicial office shall be considered a candidate for election to that

    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­­
                   l­a b­e

instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
    (b) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
    (c) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships between
written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that stresses
learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and spelling.
   (d) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read orally with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
    (e) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.
    (f) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.

competence assessment consistent with subdivision 2c before being granted an initial teaching
license to provide direct instruction to pupils in prekindergarten or elementary programs. The board
must require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program to
provide remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in
their institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination or Minnesota
reading instruction competence assessment, including those for whom English is a second
language. The colleges and universities must provide assistance in the specific academic areas of
deficiency in which the person did not achieve a qualifying score. School districts must provide
similar, appropriate, and timely remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component
and mentoring to those persons employed by the district who completed their teacher education
program outside the state of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach in Minnesota and did
not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English

who do not achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the distribution of all candidates' scores,
the number of candidates who have taken the examination at least once before, and the number of
candidates who have taken the examination at least once before and achieve a qualifying score.
    (c) A person who has completed an approved teacher preparation program and obtained a
one-year license to teach, but has not successfully completed the skills examination, may renew
the one-year license for two additional one-year periods. Each renewal of the one-year license is
contingent upon the licensee:
   (1) providing evidence of participating in an approved remedial assistance program provided
by a school district or postsecondary institution that includes a formal diagnostic component in the
specific areas in which the licensee did not obtain qualifying scores; and
    (2) attempting to successfully complete the skills examination during the period of each one-year
license.
   (d) The Board of Teaching must grant continuing licenses only to those persons who have met
board criteria for granting a continuing license, which includes successfully completing the skills
examination in reading, writing, and mathematics and, where applicable, the reading instruction
competence assessment.
    (e) All colleges and universities approved by the board of teaching to prepare persons for teacher
licensure must include in their teacher preparation programs a common core of teaching knowledge
and skills to be acquired by all persons recommended for teacher licensure. This common core
shall meet the standards developed by the interstate new teacher assessment and support consortium
in its 1992 "model standards for beginning teacher licensing and development." Amendments to
standards adopted under this paragraph are covered by chapter 14. The board of teaching shall report
annually to the education committees of the legislature on the performance of teacher candidates
on common core assessments of knowledge and skills under this paragraph during the most recent
