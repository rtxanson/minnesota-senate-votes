the extent the city's postemployment benefit actuarial liability is satisfied or otherwise defeased.
    Subd. 5. Status of irrevocable fund. (a) All monies in the irrevocable fund created in this section
are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of retired employees of the city or subgroups participating
in the city's health plan, and are not subject to claims by creditors of the state, the city, the city's
subgroups, or the current and former employees of the city or its subgroups.
    (b) The irrevocable fund created in this section shall be deemed an arrangement equivalent to a
trust for all legal purposes.
