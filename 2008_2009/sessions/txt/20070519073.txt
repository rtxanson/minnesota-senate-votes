      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 174.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; purpose. A public transit participation program is established
to carry out the objectives stated in section 174.21 by providing financial assistance from the state,
including the greater Minnesota transit ­   fu
                                             ­n ­ account established in section 16A.88, to eligible
                                               ­d
recipients outside of the metropolitan area.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 174.24, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Operating assistance; recipient classifications. (a) The commissioner shall
determine the total operating cost of any public transit system receiving or applying for assistance
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To be eligible for financial assistance,
an applicant or recipient shall provide to the commissioner all financial records and other
information and shall permit any inspection reasonably necessary to determine total operating cost
and correspondingly the amount of assistance that may be paid to the applicant or recipient. Where
more than one county or municipality contributes assistance to the operation of a public transit
system, the commissioner shall identify one as lead agency for the purpose of receiving money
under this section.
     (b) Prior to distributing operating assistance to eligible recipients for any contract period,
the commissioner shall place all recipients into one of the following classifications: urbanized
area service, small urban area service, rural area service, and elderly and disabled service. The
commissioner shall distribute funds under this section so that the percentage of total operating
cost paid by any recipient from local sources will not exceed the percentage for that recipient's
classification, except as provided in an undue hardship case. The percentages must be: for urbanized
area service and small urban area service, 20 percent; for rural area service, 15 percent; and for
elderly and disabled service, 15 percent. The remainder of the total operating cost will be paid
from state funds less any assistance received by the recipient from any federal source. For purposes
of this subdivision, "local sources" means all local sources of funds and includes all operating
revenue, tax levies, and contributions from public funds, except that the commissioner may exclude
from the total assistance contract revenues derived from operations the cost of which is excluded
from the computation of total operating cost. Total operating costs of the Duluth Transit Authority
or a successor agency does not include costs related to the Superior, Wisconsin service contract
and the Independent School District No. 709 service contract. F                                       ­o ­­

from local sources by one or more other recipients inside or outside the classification. However, the
commissioner may not reduce or increase any recipient's percentage under this paragraph for more

custodians to reflect a change in the appointment.
    (d) At the request of the license or cardholder, the department shall cancel the standby or
temporary custodian indication without additional charge. However, this paragraph does not
prohibit a fee that may be applicable for a duplicate or replacement license or card, renewal of a
license, or other service applicable to a driver's license or identification card.
    (e) Notwithstanding sections 13.08, subdivision 1, and 13.69, the department and department
employees are conclusively presumed to be acting in good faith when employees rely on statements
made, in person or by telephone, by persons purporting to be law enforcement and subsequently
release information described in paragraph (b). When acting in good faith, the department and
department personnel are immune from civil liability and not subject to suit for damages resulting
from the release of this information.

subdivision is legally valid and enforceable; and
    (2) are immune from all civil liability and not subject to suit for damages resulting from a claim
that the designation was not legally valid and enforceable.

     Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.015, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
   Subd. 24. Game birds. "Game birds" means migratory waterfowl, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed
grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, Canada spruce grouse, prairie chickens, gray partridge, bob-white quail,
wild turkeys, coots, gallinules, sora and Virginia rails, mourning dove, American woodcock, and
common snipe.
     Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.015, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 26c. Immediately released or immediately returned to the water. "Immediately
released" or "immediately returned to the water" means that a fish must not be retained longer than
is needed at the site of capture to unhook, identify, measure, or photograph the fish. Placing a fish
on a stringer, in a live well, or in a cooler, bucket, or other container is not "immediately released"
or "immediately returned to the water."
     Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.401, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

     Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.405, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Personal possession. (a) A person acting under a license or traveling from an area where
a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp
validation and a valid state driver's license, state identification card, or other form of identification
provided by the commissioner, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but
the actual license has not been issued and received. A person charged with violating the license
possession requirement shall not be convicted if the person produces in court or the office of the
arresting officer, the actual license previously issued to that person, which was valid at the time
of arrest, or satisfactory proof that at the time of the arrest the person was validly licensed. Upon

request of a conservation officer or peace officer, a licensee shall write the licensee's name in the
presence of the officer to determine the identity of the licensee.
    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.
    (d) A license or stamp issued electronically and not immediately provided to the licensee shall
be mailed to the licensee within 30 days of purchase of the license or stamp validation, except for a
pictorial turkey stamp or a pictorial trout and salmon stamp. A pictorial turkey stamp or a pictorial
trout and salmon stamp shall be mailed to the licensee after purchase of a license or stamp validation
only if the licensee pays an additional $2 fee.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.405, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Replacement licenses. (a) The commissioner may permit licensed deer hunters to
change zone, license, or season options. The commissioner may issue a replacement license if the
applicant submits the original deer license and unused tags that are being replaced and the applicant
pays any increase in cost between the original and the replacement license. A refund of the difference
in fees may be issued when a person changes from a regular deer license to a youth deer license.
When a person submits both an archery and a firearms license for replacement, the commissioner
may apply the value of both licenses towards the replacement license fee.
    (b) A replacement license may be issued only if the applicant has not used any tag from the
original license or licenses and meets the conditions of paragraph (c). The original license or licenses

  Sec. 61. [114E.10] NATURE OF RIGHTS; ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY;
SUBORDINATION OF INTERESTS.
    (a) Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property subject to the
environmental convenant, the environmental agency, or any other political subdivision or unit of
local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder.
The interest of a holder is an interest in real property. The holder is the grantee of the real property
interest conveyed under an environmental covenant.
    (b) Unless an environmental agency is a holder, any right that the agency may have with respect
to an environmental covenant does not constitute an interest in real property. Approval of an
environmental covenant does not make the environmental agency a holder unless it has authority
under law other than this chapter to acquire an interest in real property for purposes related to
an environmental response project and it is expressly identified as a holder in the environmental
covenant.
   (c) An environmental agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental
covenant, but an environmental agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an
73RD DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 19, 2007                                       5709

environmental covenant. As provided in section 114E.15, an environmental covenant is not valid
unless signed by the environmental agency and the environmental agency may set reasonable
conditions for its approval of an environmental covenant. When the environmental agency is a
federal agency, the covenant must also be approved and signed by the state environmental agency
that has authority under state law to address the release or threatened release involved in the
environmental response project. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound
by the obligations the person expressly assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does
not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter
except as provided in the covenant.
   (d) The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an
environmental covenant is created or amended:
   (1) an interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant
unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant;
    (2) this chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest
to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant;
    (3) a subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant or in a separate
record that is recorded. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a
common interest community, the environmental covenant or the subordination agreement may be
signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners' association; and
    (4) an agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects
the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the
person with respect to the environmental covenant.
   Sec. 62. [114E.15] CONTENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANT.
   (a) An environmental covenant must:
    (1) state on its first page that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed pursuant to
this chapter;
   (2) contain a legally sufficient description of the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) describe the activity and use limitations on the real property;
   (4) identify every holder;
    (5) be signed and acknowledged by the environmental agency, every holder, and every owner
of the fee simple title to the real property subject to the covenant; and
   (6) identify the name and location of any administrative record for the environmental response
project reflected in the environmental covenant.
    (b) In addition to the information required by paragraph (a), an environmental covenant may
contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by the persons who signed it,
including any:
   (1) requirements for notice of any transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed
5710                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [73RD DAY

changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the
contamination or the environmental response project on, the real property subject to the covenant;
      (2) requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant;
   (3) rights of access to the real property granted in connection with implementation or
enforcement of the covenant;
    (4) a brief narrative description of the contamination and environmental response project,
including the contaminants of concern, the pathways of exposure, limits on exposure, and the
location and extent of the contamination;
    (5) limitation on amendment or termination of the covenant in addition to those contained in
sections 114E.40 and 114E.45;
      (6) rights of the holder in addition to its right to enforce the covenant pursuant to section 114E.50;
and
    (7) waiver of a party's right to consent to the amendment or termination of a covenant under
section 114E.45, paragraph (a), clause (3).
   (c) The environmental agency may set reasonable conditions for its approval of an environmental
covenant, including:
    (1) requiring that persons specified by the agency that have interests in the real property also
sign the covenant;
   (2) requiring that a person who holds a prior interest in the real property subject to the covenant
agree to subordinate that interest where applicable; and
   (3) requiring the inclusion within the text of the covenant information, restrictions, or
requirements as described in paragraph (b).
      Sec. 63. [114E.20] VALIDITY; EFFECT ON OTHER INSTRUMENTS.
      (a) An environmental covenant created under this chapter runs with the land.
      (b) An environmental covenant that is otherwise effective is valid and enforceable even if:
      (1) it is not appurtenant to an interest in real property;
      (2) it can be or has been assigned to a person other than the original holder;
      (3) it is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law;
      (4) it imposes a negative burden;
    (5) it imposes an affirmative obligation on a person having an interest in the real property or on
the holder;
      (6) the benefit or burden does not touch or concern real property;
      (7) there is no privity of estate or contract;
      (8) the holder dies, ceases to exist, resigns, or is replaced; or

   (9) the owner of an interest in the real property subject to the environmental covenant and the
holder are the same person.
    (c) Any instrument that imposes activity and use limitations, including any conservation
easement, declaration, restrictive covenant, or similar instrument created before the effective date
of this chapter remains valid and enforceable as provided in the law under which it was created.
This chapter does not apply in any other respect to such an instrument.
    (d) This chapter does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whether designated as
an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable under the law of this state.
   Sec. 64. [114E.25] RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAND USE LAW.
    (a) This chapter does not authorize a use of real property that is otherwise prohibited by zoning,
by law other than this chapter regulating use of real property, or by a recorded instrument that has
priority over the environmental covenant.
   (b) An environmental covenant may prohibit or restrict uses of real property which are authorized
by zoning or by law other than this chapter.
    (c) An environmental agency that exercises authority under law other than this chapter to require
as part of an environmental response project the performance of a response or corrective action
that would not otherwise be an authorized use of real property under zoning or other real property
law or prior recorded instruments may include such requirement as an affirmative obligation in an
environmental covenant.
   Sec. 65. [114E.30] NOTICE.
  (a) A copy of an environmental covenant, and any amendments or notices of termination thereof,
must be provided by the persons and in the manner required by the environmental agency to:
   (1) each person that signed the covenant or their successor or assign;
   (2) each person holding a recorded interest in the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) each person in possession of the real property subject to the covenant;
   (4) each political subdivision in which real property subject to the covenant is located; and
   (5) any other person the environmental agency requires.
   (b) The validity of a covenant is not affected by failure to provide a copy of the covenant as
required under this section.
   Sec. 66. [114E.35] RECORDING.
   (a) An environmental covenant and any amendment or termination of the covenant must be
recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, as applicable, in every county in which any
portion of the real property subject to the covenant is located. For purposes of indexing, a holder
shall be treated as a grantee.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 114E.40, paragraph (f), an environmental covenant
is subject to the laws of this state governing recording and priority of interests in real property.

  Sec. 67. [114E.40] DURATION; MODIFICATION                              OR     TERMINATION           BY
ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT ACTION.
      (a) An environmental covenant is perpetual unless it is:
      (1) by its terms limited to a specific duration or terminated by the occurrence of a specific event;
      (2) terminated by consent pursuant to section 114E.45;
      (3) terminated pursuant to paragraph (b) or (e);
      (4) terminated by foreclosure of an interest that has priority over the environmental covenant; or
      (5) terminated or modified in an eminent domain proceeding, but only if:
      (i) the environmental agency that signed the covenant is a party to the proceeding;
      (ii) all persons identified in paragraph (c) are given notice of the pendency of the proceeding;
and
   (iii) the court determines, after hearing, that the activity and use limitations subject to termination
or modification are no longer required to protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (b) The environmental agency that approved an environmental covenant may determine whether
to terminate or reduce the burden on the real property of the covenant if the agency determines that
some or all of the activity and use limitations under the covenant are no longer required to protect
public health or welfare or the environment or modify the covenant if the agency determines that
modification is required to adequately protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (c) The environmental agency shall provide notice of any proposed action under paragraph (b)
to each person with a current recorded interest in the real property subject to the environmental
covenant, each holder, all other persons who originally signed the environmental covenant, or their
successors or assigns, and any other person with rights or obligations under the covenant. The
environmental agency shall provide 30 days for comment on the proposed action by parties entitled
to notice. Any person entitled to notice under this paragraph may request a contested case under
chapter 14 by making the request in writing within the 30-day comment period. A determination by
an environmental agency under this paragraph is a final agency decision subject to judicial review
in the same manner as provided in sections 14.63 to 14.68 or under applicable federal law.
    (d) Any person entitled to notice under paragraph (c) may apply in writing to the environmental
agency for a determination under paragraph (b) that an existing covenant be terminated, that the
burden of a covenant be reduced, or that covenant be modified. The application must specify the
determination sought by the applicant, the reasons why the environmental agency should make
the determination, and the information which would support it. If the environmental agency fails
to commence a proceeding under paragraph (b) within 60 days of receipt of the application, the
applicant may bring a de novo action in the district court for termination, reduction of burden, or
modification of the environmental covenant pursuant to paragraph (e).
   (e) The district court for the county in which the real property subject to an environmental
covenant is located may, under the doctrine of changed circumstances, terminate the covenant,
reduce its burden on the real property, or modify its terms in a de novo action if an environmental
agency fails to commence a proceeding within 60 days as provided under paragraph (d). The
73RD DAY]                           SATURDAY, MAY 19, 2007                                          5713

applicant under paragraph (d), any party to the environmental covenant, or any other person
identified in paragraph (c) may commence an action under this paragraph. The person commencing
the action shall serve notice of the action on the environmental agency and any person entitled
to notice under paragraph (c). The court shall terminate, reduce the burden of, or modify the
environmental covenant if the court determines that the person bringing the action shows that some
or all of the activity and use limitations under the covenant do not, or are no longer required to,
protect public health or welfare or the environment.
    (f) An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired through issuance of
a tax deed, foreclosure of a tax lien, or application of the doctrine of adverse possession, prescription,
abandonment, waiver, lack of enforcement, or acquiescence, or a similar doctrine.
    (g) An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired by application of
section 500.20 or 541.023.
   Sec. 68. [114E.45] AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION BY CONSENT.
    (a) An environmental covenant may be amended or terminated by consent only if the amendment
or termination is signed by:
   (1) the environmental agency;
   (2) the current owner of the fee simple title to the real property subject to the covenant;
   (3) every other original signatory to the covenant, or their successor or assign, unless:
   (i) the person waived the right to consent to termination or modification in the environmental
covenant or another signed and acknowledged record that is recorded;
    (ii) the person fails to object to the amendment or termination within 60 days after a notice
requesting the person's consent to amendment or termination was mailed by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the person's last known address, as obtained from the United States Postal
Service; or
   (iii) a court finds that the person no longer exists or cannot be located or identified with the
exercise of reasonable diligence; and
   (4) each holder, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d).
Any person may establish that the notice described in clause (3), item (ii), was properly mailed by
recording an affidavit to that effect from a person having knowledge of the facts, and a certified
copy of the recorded affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
    (b) If an interest in real property is subject to an environmental covenant, the interest is not
affected by an amendment of the covenant unless the current owner of the interest consents to the
amendment or has waived in the environmental covenant or other signed record the right to consent
to amendments.
   (c) Except for an assignment undertaken pursuant to a governmental reorganization, or as
otherwise provided in the environmental covenant, assignment of an environmental covenant to
a new holder is an amendment.
5714                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [73RD DAY

       (d) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) or in an environmental covenant:
       (1) a holder may not assign its interest without consent of the other parties specified in paragraph
(a);
   (2) a holder may be removed and replaced by agreement of the other parties specified in
paragraph (a); and
       (3) a court of competent jurisdiction may fill a vacancy in the position of holder.
       Sec. 69. [114E.50] ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANT.
   (a) A civil action for injunctive or other equitable relief for violation of an environmental
covenant may be maintained by:
       (1) a party to the covenant, including all holders;
       (2) the environmental agency that signed the covenant;
       (3) any person to whom the covenant expressly grants power to enforce;
    (4) a person whose interest in the real property or whose collateral or liability may be affected
by the alleged violation of the covenant; or
       (5) a political subdivision in which the real property subject to the covenant is located.
    (b) The state environmental agency that signed the covenant may use any remedy or enforcement
measure provided in section 115.071, subdivisions 3 to 5, or 116.072 to remedy violations of a
covenant. This paragraph does not limit the state environmental agency from taking action to enforce
the terms of a covenant against a person required to comply with the covenant in connection with that
person's obligation to perform response actions or as a condition of receiving a liability assurance
with respect to a release or threatened release of contaminants.
   (c) This chapter does not limit the regulatory authority of the environmental agency under law
other than this chapter with respect to an environmental response project.
    (d) A person is not responsible for or subject to liability arising from a release or threatened
release of contamination into the environment, or for remediation costs attendant thereto, solely
because it has signed, holds rights to, or otherwise has the right to enforce an environmental
covenant.
       Sec. 70. [114E.60] UNIFORMITY OF APPLICATION AND CONSTRUCTION.
    In applying and construing this chapter, consideration must be given to the need to promote
uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.
  Sec. 71. [114E.65] RELATION TO ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN GLOBAL AND
NATIONAL COMMERCE ACT.
    This chapter modifies, limits, or supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, United States Code, title 15, section 7001 et seq., but does not modify,
limit, or supersede section 101 of that act, United States Code, title 15, section 7001(a), or authorize
electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103 of that act, United States Code,

title 15, section 7003(b).
   Sec. 72. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 115.072, is amended to read:
   115.072 RECOVERY OF LITIGATION COSTS AND EXPENSES.
    In any action brought by the attorney general, in the name of the state, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter and chapters 114C, 114E, and 116, for civil penalties, injunctive relief, or in an action
to compel compliance, if the state shall finally prevail, and if the proven violation was willful, the
state, in addition to other penalties provided in this chapter, may be allowed an amount determined
by the court to be the reasonable value of all or a part of the litigation expenses incurred by the
state. In determining the amount of such litigation expenses to be allowed, the court shall give
consideration to the economic circumstances of the defendant.
    Amounts recovered under the provisions of this section and section 115.071, subdivisions 3 to
5, shall be paid into the environmental fund in the state treasury to the extent provided in section
115.073.

   (b) A license is not required for a person who complies with the applicable requirements if the
person is:
    (1) a qualified employee of state or local government who has passed the examination described
in paragraph (d) or a similar examination;
    (2) an individual who constructs an individual sewage treatment system on land that is owned
or leased by the individual and functions solely as the individual's dwelling or seasonal dwelling;
    (3) a farmer who pumps and disposes of sewage waste from individual sewage treatment
systems, holding tanks, and privies on land that is owned or leased by the farmer; or
   (4) an individual who performs labor or services for a person licensed under this section in
connection with the design, installation, maintenance, pumping, or inspection of an individual
sewage treatment system at the direction and under the personal supervision of a person licensed
under this section.
    A person constructing an individual sewage treatment system under clause (2) must consult with
a site evaluator or designer before beginning construction. In addition, the system must be inspected
before being covered and a compliance report must be provided to the local unit of government after
the inspection.
    (c) The commissioner, in conjunction with the University of Minnesota Extension Service or
another higher education institution, shall ensure adequate training exists for individual sewage
treatment system professionals.
    (d) The commissioner shall conduct examinations to test the knowledge of applicants for
licensing and shall issue documentation of licensing.

acquire an easement by condemnation only if the agency is unable, after reasonable efforts, to
acquire an interest in real property by purchase or donation. The provisions of chapter 117 govern
condemnation proceedings by the agency under this subdivision. A donation of an interest in real
property to the agency is not effective until the agency executes a certificate of acceptance. The
state is not liable under this chapter solely as a result of acquiring an interest in real property under
this subdivision. Agency approval of an environmental convenant under chapter 114E is sufficient
evidence of acceptance of an interest in real property where the agency is expressly identified as a
holder in the covenant.

   Subdivision 1. Public corporation; listed powers. (a) Each county is a body politic and
corporate and may:
   (1) Sue and be sued.
    (2) Acquire and hold real and personal property for the use of the county, and lands sold for
taxes as provided by law.
   (3) Purchase and hold for the benefit of the county real estate sold by virtue of judicial
proceedings, to which the county is a party.
    (4) Sell, lease, and convey real or personal estate owned by the county, and give contracts or
options to sell, lease, or convey it, and make orders respecting it as deemed conducive to the interests
of the county's inhabitants.
   (5) Make all contracts and do all other acts in relation to the property and concerns of the county
necessary to the exercise of its corporate powers.
    (b) No sale, lease, or conveyance of real estate owned by the county, except the lease of a
residence acquired for the furtherance of an approved capital improvement project, nor any contract
or option for it, shall be valid, without first advertising for bids or proposals in the official newspaper
of the county for three consecutive weeks and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area
where the property is located. The notice shall state the time and place of considering the proposals,
contain a legal description of any real estate, and a brief description of any personal property. Leases
that do not exceed $15,000 for any one year may be negotiated and are not subject to the competitive
bid procedures of this section. All proposals estimated to exceed $15,000 in any one year shall be
considered at the time set for the bid opening, and the one most favorable to the county accepted,
but the county board may, in the interest of the county, reject any or all proposals.
    (c) Sales of personal property the value of which is estimated to be $15,000 or more shall be
made only after advertising for bids or proposals in the county's official newspaper, on the county's
Web site, or in a recognized industry trade journal. At the same time it posts on its Web site or
publishes in a trade journal, the county must publish in the official newspaper, either as part of the
minutes of a regular meeting of the county board or in a separate notice, a summary of all requests
for bids or proposals that the county advertises on its Web site or in a trade journal. After publication
in the official newspaper, on the Web site, or in a trade journal, bids or proposals may be solicited
and accepted by the electronic selling process authorized in section 471.345, subdivision 17. Sales
of personal property the value of which is estimated to be less than $15,000 may be made either
on competitive bids or in the open market, in the discretion of the county board. "Web site" means
a specific, addressable location provided on a server connected to the Internet and hosting World
Wide Web pages and other files that are generally accessible on the Internet all or most of a day.
    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the county may, when acquiring real
property for county highway right-of-way, exchange parcels of real property of substantially
similar or equal value without advertising for bids. The estimated values for these parcels shall be
determined by the county assessor.
   (e) If real estate or personal property remains unsold after advertising for and consideration of
bids or proposals the county may employ a broker to sell the property. The broker may sell the
property for not less than 90 percent of its appraised market value as determined by the county. The

broker's fee shall be set by agreement with the county but may not exceed ten percent of the sale
price and must be paid from the proceeds of the sale.
    (f) A county or its agent may rent a county-owned residence acquired for the furtherance of
an approved capital improvement project subject to the conditions set by the county board and not
subject to the conditions for lease otherwise provided by paragraph (a), clause (4), and paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (e), and (g).
    (g) In no case shall lands be disposed of without there being reserved to the county all iron ore
and other valuable minerals in and upon the lands, with right to explore for, mine and remove the
iron ore and other valuable minerals, nor shall the minerals and mineral rights be disposed of, either
before or after disposition of the surface rights, otherwise than by mining lease, in similar general
form to that provided by section 93.20 for mining leases affecting state lands. The lease shall be
for a term not exceeding 50 years, and be issued on a royalty basis, the royalty to be not less than
25 cents per ton of 2,240 pounds, and fix a minimum amount of royalty payable during each year,
whether mineral is removed or not. Prospecting options for mining leases may be granted for periods
not exceeding one year. The options shall require, among other things, periodical showings to the
county board of the results of exploration work done.
    (h) Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, the county may, when selling
real property owned in fee simple that cannot be improved because of noncompliance with local
ordinances regarding minimum area, shape, frontage, or access, proceed to sell the nonconforming
parcel without advertising for bid. At the county's discretion, the real property may be restricted
to sale to adjoining landowners or may be sold to any other interested party. The property shall be
sold to the highest bidder, but in no case shall the property be sold for less than 90 percent of its
fair market value as determined by the county assessor. All owners of land adjoining the land to be
sold shall be given a written notice at least 30 days before the sale. This paragraph shall be liberally
construed to encourage the sale of nonconforming real property and promote its return to the tax
roles.

   (4) recommendations for streamlining and consolidating metropolitan area water supply
decision-making and approval processes; and

planning activities and capital investments.

     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.057, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Credit adjustments, refunds. (a) If an employer makes an application for a credit
adjustment of any amount paid under this chapter or section 116L.20 within four years of the
date that the payment was due, in a manner and format prescribed by the commissioner, and
the commissioner determines that the payment or any portion was erroneous, the commissioner
shall make an adjustment and issue a credit without interest. If a credit cannot be used, the
commissioner shall refund, without interest, the amount erroneously paid. The commissioner, on
the commissioner's own motion, may make a credit adjustment or refund under this subdivision.

    The unemployment law judge must order an additional evidentiary hearing if an involved party
shows that evidence which was not submitted at the evidentiary hearing: (1) would likely change
the outcome of the decision and there was good cause for not having previously submitted that
evidence; or (2) would show that the evidence that was submitted at the evidentiary hearing was
likely false and that the likely false evidence had an effect on the outcome of the decision.
     (d) If the involved applicant or involved employer who filed the request for reconsideration
failed to participate in the evidentiary hearing conducted under subdivision 1, an order setting aside
the findings of fact and decision and directing that an additional evidentiary hearing be conducted
must be issued if the party who failed to participate had good cause for failing to do so. In the notice

    (g) The base tax rate and any additional assessments are assessed on all taxpaying employers to
cover a portion of the costs to the trust fund for unemployment benefits paid that do not affect any
single employer's future experience rating because:
       (1) the employer's experience rating is limited by the maximum under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b);
       (2) the employer has ceased doing business; or
  (3) the unemployment benefits paid have been determined not to be used in computing the
employer's experience rating under section 268.047, subdivision 2 or 3.

   (c) The use of 125 percent of unemployment benefits paid under paragraph (a), rather than 100
percent of the amount of unemployment benefits paid, is done in order for the trust fund to recover
from all taxpaying employers a portion of the costs of unemployment benefits paid that do not affect
any individual employer's future experience rating because of the reasons set out in subdivision 2,
paragraph (g).

30 calendar days of the date of acquisition. Any successor employer that fails to notify the
commissioner is subject to the penalties under section 268.184, subdivision 1a, if the successor's
experience rating was lower than the predecessor's experience rating at the time of the acquisition.

    For purposes of this chapter, an "acquisition" means anything that results in the obtaining by the
successor employer, in any way or manner, of the organization, trade or business, or workforce of
the predecessor employer.

commissioner or an employer;
    (2) failed to accept suitable employment when offered; or
    (3) avoided an offer of suitable employment.

employment to fail to apply for, accept, or avoid suitable employment. Good cause includes:
    (1) the applicant is employed in other suitable employment;
    (2) the applicant is in reemployment assistance training;
    (3) the applicant formerly worked for the employer and the loss of employment occurred
prior to the commencement of a labor dispute, was permanent or for an indefinite period, and the
applicant failed to apply for or accept the employment because a labor dispute was in progress at
the establishment; or
    (4) the applicant formerly worked for the employer and quit that employment because of a good
reason caused by the employer.
    (c) This subdivision only applies to offers of suitable employment with a new or a former

    This article substitutes the term "disqualify" or similar terms with the term "ineligible" or
similar terms in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 268. Both terms are currently used throughout the

for simplification, to achieve consistency and avoid confusion, as the terms have the same common
meaning and the same effect under the statute.

raised an issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section. A statement of "protest" or a similar
term without more information does not constitute raising an issue of ineligibility for purposes of
this section.

268.095, subdivision 10.
   (e) The commissioner may issue a determination on an issue of ineligibility at any time within
24 months from the establishment of a benefit account based upon information from any source,
even if the issue of ineligibility was not raised by the applicant or an employer.
    This paragraph does not prevent the imposition of a penalty under section 268.18, subdivision
2, or 268.182.
    (f) A determination of eligibility or determination of ineligibility is final unless an appeal is
filed by the applicant or notified employer within 20 calendar days after sending. The determination
must contain a prominent statement indicating the consequences of not appealing. Proceedings on
the appeal are conducted in accordance with section 268.105.
    (g) An issue of ineligibility required to be determined under this section includes any question
regarding the denial or allowing of unemployment benefits under this chapter except for issues under
section 268.07. An issue of ineligibility for purposes of this section includes any question of effect
on an employer under section 268.047.
    (h) Except for issues of ineligibility as a result of a quit or discharge of the applicant, the employer
will be (1) sent a copy of the determination of eligibility or a determination of ineligibility, or
(2) considered an involved employer for purposes of an appeal under section 268.105, only if the
employer raised the issue of ineligibility.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.035, subdivision 23a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23a. Suitable employment. (a) Suitable employment means employment in the
applicant's labor market area that is reasonably related to the applicant's qualifications. In
determining whether any employment is suitable for an applicant, the degree of risk involved
to the health and safety, physical fitness, prior training, experience, length of unemployment,
prospects for securing employment in the applicant's customary occupation, and the distance of the
employment from the applicant's residence ­ sh

temporary or permanent nature of the applicant's separation from employment and whether the
applicant has favorable prospects of finding employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation at the applicant's past wage level within a reasonable period of time.
   If prospects are unfavorable, employment at lower skill or wage levels is suitable if the
applicant is reasonably suited for the employment considering the applicant's education, training,
work experience, and current physical and mental ability.
   The total compensation must be considered, including the wage rate, hours of employment,
method of payment, overtime practices, bonuses, incentive payments, and fringe benefits.
    (c) When potential employment is at a rate of pay lower than the applicant's former rate,
consideration must be given to the length of the applicant's unemployment and the proportion of
difference in the rates. Employment that may not be suitable because of lower wages during the
early weeks of the applicant's unemployment may become suitable as the duration of unemployment
lengthens.
    (d) For an applicant seasonally unemployed, suitable employment includes temporary work in
a lower skilled occupation that pays average gross weekly wages equal to or more than 150 percent
of the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount.
    (e) If a majority of the applicant's wage credits were earned from part-time employment,
part-time employment in a position with comparable skills and comparable hours that pays average
gross weekly wages equal to or more than 150 percent of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount ­

                  a­l­b
                      ­­e is considered suitable employment.
    (f) To determine suitability of employment in terms of shifts, the arrangement of hours in addition
to the total number of hours is to be considered. Employment on a second, third, rotating, or split
shift is suitable employment if it is customary in the occupation in the labor market area.

   (2) the wages, hours, or other conditions of employment are substantially less favorable than
those prevailing for similar employment in the labor market area; or
   (3) as a condition of becoming employed, the applicant would be required to join a company
union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.

   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.052, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Method of payment by political subdivision. A political subdivision or
instrumentality thereof is authorized and directed to pay its liabilities by money collected from
taxes or other revenues. Every political subdivision authorized to levy taxes except school districts
may include in its tax levy the amount necessary to pay its liabilities. School districts may levy
according to section 126C.43, subdivision 2. If the taxes authorized to be levied cause the total
amount of taxes levied to exceed any limitation upon the power of a political subdivision to levy
taxes, the political subdivision may levy taxes in excess of the limitations in the amounts necessary
to meet its liability. The expenditures authorized ­sh

of government as defined in any home rule charter. The governing body of a municipality, for the
purpose of meeting its liabilities, in the event of a deficit, may issue its obligations payable in
not more than two years, in an amount that may cause its indebtedness to exceed any statutory
or charter limitations, without an election, and may levy taxes in the manner provided in section
475.61.

personal, of the person liable, from the date of assessment. The term "date of assessment" means
the date the obligation was due.
    (b) The lien is not enforceable against any purchaser, mortgagee, pledgee, holder of a Uniform
Commercial Code security interest, mechanic's lien, or judgment lien creditor, until a notice of lien
has been filed with the county recorder of the county where the property is situated, or in the case of
personal property belonging to a nonresident person in the Office of the Secretary of State. When the

county recorders, the date and time of receipt of the notice and county recorder's file number, and for
notices filed electronically with the secretary of state, the secretary of state's recording information,

a purchaser of tangible personal property purchased at retail or personal property listed as exempt
in sections 550.37, 550.38, and 550.39.
    (f) A notice of lien filed has priority over any security interest arising under chapter 336, article
9, that is perfected prior in time to the lien imposed by this subdivision, but only if:
     (1) the perfected security interest secures property not in existence at the time the notice of lien
is filed; and
    (2) the property comes into existence after the 45th calendar day following the day the notice of
lien is filed, or after the secured party has actual notice or knowledge of the lien filing, whichever
is earlier.

under chapter 550.
  (i) The lien may be imposed upon property defined as homestead property in chapter 510 but
may be enforced only upon the sale, transfer, or conveyance of the homestead property.

    Subd. 2. Levy. (a) If any amount due under this chapter or section 116L.20, from an applicant or
an employer, is not paid when due, the amount may be collected by the commissioner by direct levy
upon all property and rights of property of the person liable for the amount due except that exempt
from execution under section 550.37. The term "levy" includes the power of distraint and seizure
by any means.
    (b) In addition to a direct levy, the commissioner may issue a warrant to the sheriff of any county
who shall proceed within 60 calendar days to levy upon the property or rights to property of the
delinquent person within the county, except that exempt under section 550.37. The sheriff shall sell
that property necessary to satisfy the total amount due, together with the commissioner's and sheriff's
costs. The sales ­sh

calendar day period.

commenced a legal action for collection.

of the total amount due ­

                         ­­ l­ must not be sold until any determination of liability has become final.

No sale ­sh
          ­­ l­ may be made unless a portion of the amount due remains unpaid for a period of more
           a­l
than 30 calendar days after the determination of liability becomes final. Seized property may be sold
at any time if:
   (1) the delinquent person consents in writing to the sale; or
    (2) the commissioner determines that the property is perishable or may become greatly reduced
in price or value by keeping, or that the property cannot be kept without great expense.
    (g) Where a levy has been made to collect the amount due and the property seized is properly
included in a formal proceeding commenced under sections 524.3-401 to 524.3-505 and maintained
under full supervision of the court, the property ­

are completed or until the court orders.

                            ­­a­l

    (1) gives a surety bond equal to the appraised value of the owner's interest in the property, as
determined by the commissioner, or
   (2) deposits with the commissioner security in a form and amount the commissioner considers
necessary to insure payment of the liability.
    (i) If a levy or sale would irreparably injure rights in property that the court determines superior
to rights of the state, the court may grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of the levy or to
prohibit the sale.
    (j) Any person who fails or refuses to surrender without reasonable cause any property or rights

or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount due.
    (k) If the commissioner has seized the property of any individual, that individual may, upon
giving 48 hours notice to the commissioner and to the court, bring a claim for equitable relief
before the district court for the release of the property upon terms and conditions the court considers
equitable.
    (l) Any person in control or possession of property or rights to property upon which a levy has
been made who surrenders the property or rights to property, or who pays the amount due ­     sh

the property or rights to property.

levied upon if the commissioner determines that the release will facilitate the collection of the

expiration of nine months from the date of levy.

under chapter 550.

finance, or to any state agency that disburses its own funds, that a person, applicant, or employer has
a liability under this chapter or section 116L.20, and that the state has purchased personal services,
supplies, contract services, or property from that person, the commissioner of finance or the state
agency shall set off and pay to the commissioner an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid liability
from funds appropriated for payment of the obligation of the state otherwise due the person. No
amount ­  sh

    Subd. 16. Actively seeking suitable employment defined. (a) "Actively seeking suitable
employment" means those reasonable, diligent efforts an individual in similar circumstances would
make if genuinely interested in obtaining suitable employment under the existing conditions in the
labor market area. Limiting the search to positions that are not available or are above the applicant's
training, experience, and qualifications is not "actively seeking suitable employment."
    (b) To be considered "actively seeking suitable employment" an applicant ­ sh
                                                                                ­­

of work and request suitable employment.
   (c) If reasonable prospects of suitable employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation do not exist, the applicant must actively seek other suitable employment to be
considered "actively seeking suitable employment." This applies to an applicant who is seasonally
unemployed.
    (d) An applicant who is seeking employment only through a union is not actively seeking suitable
employment unless the applicant is in an occupation where it is required by union rule that all
the hiring in that locality is done through the union or that all members are restricted to obtaining
employment among signatory contractors in the construction industry. The applicant must be a union
member in good standing, registered with the union for employment, and in compliance with other
union rules to be considered "actively seeking suitable employment."

a continued biweekly request by that applicant. An applicant may ask that one of the other allowed

as administrative capacity in determining whether to allow an applicant to change the designated
method for filing a continued biweekly request for unemployment benefits.
   Sec. 64. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 268.086, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

   (3) that would compel an average, reasonable worker to quit and become unemployed rather
than remaining in the employment.
   (b) The analysis required in paragraph (a) must be applied to the specific facts of each case.

   (c) If an applicant was subjected to adverse working conditions by the employer, the applicant
must complain to the employer and give the employer a reasonable opportunity to correct the adverse

harassment of which the employer was aware, or should have been aware, and the employer failed to
take timely and appropriate action. Sexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, sexually motivated physical contact or other conduct or communication of a sexual
nature when:
    (1) the applicant's submission to the conduct or communication is made a term or condition of
the employment;
   (2) the applicant's submission to or rejection of the conduct or communication is the basis for
decisions affecting employment; or
   (3) the conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an
applicant's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

    Section 1. LUMBER COMPANY EXTRA BENEFITS.
   Subdivision 1. Extra benefits; availability. Extra unemployment benefits are available to an
applicant if the applicant was laid off due to lack of work after April 1, 2006, from the Ainsworth
Lumber Company plants in Bemidji, Cook, and Grand Rapids, and established a benefit account
under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.07, prior to March 1, 2007.
    Subd. 2. Payment from fund; effect on employer. Extra unemployment benefits are payable
from the unemployment insurance trust fund. Extra unemployment benefits paid under this
section will not be used in computing the experience rating of Ainsworth Lumber Company under
Minnesota Statutes, section 268.047.

   Subd. 3. Eligibility conditions. An applicant is eligible to receive extra unemployment benefits
under this section for any week through December 31, 2007, following the effective date of the
applicant's benefit account of regular unemployment benefits, as a result of a layoff described under
subdivision 1, if:
   (1) a majority of the applicant's wage credits were with Ainsworth Lumber Company or
Ainsworth Engineered;
   (2) the applicant meets the eligibility requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 268.085;
   (3) the applicant is not subject to a disqualification under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.095;
    (4) the applicant is not entitled to regular unemployment benefits and the applicant is not entitled
to receive unemployment benefits under any other state or federal law for that week; and
    (5) the applicant is enrolled in, or has within the last two weeks successfully completed, a
program that qualifies as reemployment assistance training under Minnesota Statutes, section
268.035, subdivision 21a, except that an applicant whose training is scheduled to begin in more
than 30 days may be considered to be in training if: (i) the applicant's chosen training program does
not offer an available start date within 30 days; (ii) the applicant is scheduled to begin training on
the earliest available start date for the chosen training program; and (iii) the applicant is scheduled
to begin training in no more than 60 days.
    Subd. 4. Weekly amount of extra benefits. The weekly extra unemployment benefits amount
available to an applicant is the same as the applicant's weekly regular unemployment benefit amount
on the benefit account established as a result of a layoff under subdivision 1.
   Subd. 5. Maximum amount of extra unemployment benefits. (a) The maximum amount
of extra unemployment benefits available is equal to 13 weeks at the applicant's weekly extra
unemployment benefits amount.
    (b) If an applicant qualifies for a new regular benefit account under Minnesota Statutes,
section 268.07, at any time after exhausting regular unemployment benefits as a result of the
layoff under subdivision 1, the applicant must apply for and exhaust entitlement to those new
regular unemployment benefits. The maximum amount of extra unemployment benefits available
is reduced by any new regular unemployment benefits available if the majority of wage credits on
that new regular benefit account were with Ainsworth Lumber Company or Ainsworth Engineered.
    Subd. 6. Program expiration. This extra unemployment benefit program expires on December
31, 2007. No extra unemployment benefits may be paid for any week after the expiration of this
program.
    Subd. 7. Findings. The legislature finds that providing extra unemployment benefits to assist
laid-off workers of Ainsworth Lumber Company, while in training, is appropriate because:
   (1) the unemployment rate in the applicant's county of employment is higher than the statewide
average rate of unemployment;
    (2) the average weekly wages paid in the applicant's county of employment is below the
statewide average weekly wage;
   (3) the applicant's weekly wage is higher than the statewide average weekly wage; and

    (4) the dislocated worker program has determined that the applicant does not currently possess
skills making reemployment in a comparable position likely.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 1377 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
     That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 1377 be further amended as follows:
     Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
                                                            "ARTICLE 1
              GENERAL LAWS GOVERNING BOARDS AND ADVISORY GROUPS
     Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 15.059, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Expiration date. (a) Unless a different date is specified by law, the existence of each
advisory council and committee expires on the date specified in the law establishing the group
or on June 30, 2­0
                 ­0­3
                    ­ 2009, whichever is sooner. This subdivision applies whether or not the law
establishing the group provides that the group is governed by this section. The secretary of state
must notify the primary appointing authority or chair of an advisory council or committee of its
scheduled expiration before the start of the annual legislative session immediately preceding the
group's scheduled expiration.
     (b) An advisory council or committee does not expire in accordance with paragraph (a) if it:
     (1) is an occupational licensure advisory group to a licensing board or agency;
     (2) administers and awards grants; or
     (3) is required by federal law or regulation.
                                                             ARTICLE 2

carry out all the responsibilities under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as provided by Public
Law 108-364, as amended. The Minnesota Assistive Technology Advisory Council is established
to fulfill the responsibilities required by the Assistive Technology Act, as provided by Public Law
108-364, as amended. Because the existence of this council is required by federal law, this council
does not expire and the expiration date provided in section 15.059, subdivision 5, does not apply.
    (b) The governor shall appoint the membership of the council as required by the Assistive
Technology Act of 1998, as provided by Public Law 108-364, as amended. After the governor
has completed the appointments required by this subdivision, the commissioner of administration,
or the commissioner's designee, shall convene the first meeting of the council following the
appointments. Members shall serve two-year terms commencing July 1 of each odd-numbered
year, and receive the compensation specified by the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, as provided
by Public Law 108-364, as amended. The members of the council shall select their chair at the first
meeting following their appointment.
       Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16B.181, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Public entities; purchases from corrections industries. (a) The commissioner of
corrections, in consultation with the commissioner of administration, shall prepare updated lists of
the items available for purchase from Department of Corrections industries and annually forward a
copy of the most recent list to all public entities within the state. A public entity that is supported
in whole or in part with funds from the state treasury may purchase items directly from corrections
industries. The bid solicitation process is not required for these purchases.
    (b) The commissioner of administration shall develop a contract or contracts to enable public
entities to purchase items directly from corrections industries. The commissioner of administration,
in consultation with the commissioner of corrections, shall determine the fair market price for listed
items. The commissioner of administration shall require that all requests for bids or proposals,
for items provided by corrections industries, be forwarded to the commissioner of corrections to
enable corrections industries to submit bids. The commissioner of corrections shall consult with the
commissioner of administration prior to introducing new products to the state agency market.
   (c) No public entity may evade the intent of this section by adopting slight variations
in specifications, when Minnesota corrections industry items meet the reasonable needs and
specifications of the public entity.
       (d) The commissioners of administration and corrections shall develop annual performance
measures outlining goals to maximize inmate work program participation. T                                                                      ­h­­ e­­ co­m­m  ­­si­­

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.03, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Change in classification of data; effect of dissemination among agencies. (a) The
classification of data in the possession of an entity shall change if it is required to do so to comply
with either judicial or administrative rules pertaining to the conduct of legal actions or with a specific
statute applicable to the data in the possession of the disseminating or receiving entity.
   (b) If data on individuals is classified as both private and confidential by this chapter, or any
other statute or federal law, the data is private.
    (c) To the extent that government data is disseminated to a government entity by another
government entity, the data disseminated shall have the same classification in the hands of the
entity receiving it as it had in the hands of the entity providing it.
    (d) If a government entity disseminates data to another government entity, a classification
provided for by law in the hands of the entity receiving the data does not affect the classification
of the data in the hands of the entity that disseminates the data.
    (e) To the extent that judicial branch data is disseminated to government entities by the judicial
branch, the data disseminated shall have the same level of accessibility in the hands of the agency
receiving it as it had in the hands of the judicial branch entity providing it.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Access to data by individual. Upon request to a responsible authority or designee, an
individual shall be informed whether the individual is the subject of stored data on individuals, and
whether it is classified as public, private or confidential. Upon further request, an individual who
is the subject of stored private or public data on individuals shall be shown the data without any
charge and, if desired, shall be informed of the content and meaning of that data. After an individual
has been shown the private data and informed of its meaning, the data need not be disclosed to that
individual for six months thereafter unless a dispute or action pursuant to this section is pending or
additional data on the individual has been collected or created. The responsible authority or designee
shall provide copies of the private or public data upon request by the individual subject of the data.
The responsible authority or designee may require the requesting person to pay the actual costs of
making, ­ and certifying,

made pursuant to this subdivision, or within ten days of the date of the request, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays, if immediate compliance is not possible.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.04, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Procedure when data is not accurate or complete. (a) An individual subject of
the data may contest the accuracy or completeness of public or private data. To exercise this
right, an individual shall notify in writing the responsible authority describing the nature of the
disagreement. The responsible authority shall within 30 days either: (1) correct the data found
to be inaccurate or incomplete and attempt to notify past recipients of inaccurate or incomplete
data, including recipients named by the individual; or (2) notify the individual that the authority

believes the data to be correct. Data in dispute shall be disclosed only if the individual's statement
of disagreement is included with the disclosed data.
    The determination of the responsible authority may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act relating to contested cases. Upon receipt of an appeal by an individual,
the commissioner shall, before issuing the order and notice of a contested case hearing required by
chapter 14, try to resolve the dispute through education, conference, conciliation, or persuasion. If
the parties consent, the commissioner may refer the matter to mediation. Following these efforts,
the commissioner shall dismiss the appeal or issue the order and notice of hearing.

entity shall transfer or disseminate any private or confidential data on individuals to the private
international organization known as Interpol, except through the Interpol-United States National
Central Bureau, United States Department of Justice.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.072, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Opinion; when required. (a) Upon request of a government entity, the
commissioner may give a written opinion on any question relating to public access to government
data, rights of subjects of data, or classification of data under this chapter or other Minnesota
statutes governing government data practices. Upon request of any person who disagrees with a
determination regarding data practices made by a government entity, the commissioner may give
a written opinion regarding the person's rights as a subject of government data or right to have
access to government data.
    (b) Upon request of a body subject to chapter 13D, the commissioner may give a written opinion
on any question relating to the body's duties under chapter 13D. Upon request of a person who
disagrees with the manner in which members of a governing body perform their duties under chapter
13D, the commissioner may give a written opinion on compliance with chapter 13D. A governing
body or person requesting an opinion under this paragraph must pay the commissioner a fee of $200.
Money received by the commissioner under this paragraph is appropriated to the commissioner for
the purposes of this section.
    (c) If the commissioner determines that no opinion will be issued, the commissioner shall give
the government entity or body subject to chapter 13D or person requesting the opinion notice of the
decision not to issue the opinion within five business days of receipt of the request. If this notice is
not given, the commissioner shall issue an opinion within 20 days of receipt of the request.
   (d) For good cause and upon written notice to the person requesting the opinion, the
commissioner may extend this deadline for one additional 30-day period. The notice must state
73RD DAY]                                      SATURDAY, MAY 19, 2007                                                            5865

the reason for extending the deadline. The government entity or the members of a body subject
to chapter 13D must be provided a reasonable opportunity to explain the reasons for its decision
regarding the data or how they perform their duties under chapter 13D. The commissioner or the
government entity or body subject to chapter 13D may choose to give notice to the subject of the
data concerning the dispute regarding the data or compliance with chapter 13D.
    (e) This section does not apply to a determination made by the commissioner of health under
section 13.3805, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), or 144.6581.
   (f) A written, numbered, and published opinion issued by the attorney general shall take
precedence over an opinion issued by the commissioner under this section.
     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.08, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Action to compel compliance. (a) In addition to the remedies provided in subdivisions
1 to 3 or any other law, any aggrieved person seeking to enforce the person's rights under this chapter
or obtain access to data may bring an action in district court to compel compliance with this chapter
and may recover costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, as determined by the
court. If the court determines that an action brought under this subdivision is frivolous and without
merit and a basis in fact, it may award reasonable costs and attorney fees to the responsible authority.
If the court issues an order to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court may impose a
civil penalty of up to $300 against the government entity. This penalty is payable to the state general
fund and is in addition to damages under subdivision 1. The matter shall be heard as soon as possible.
In an action involving a request for government data under section 13.03 or 13.04, the court may
inspect in camera the government data in dispute, but shall conduct its hearing in public and in a
manner that protects the security of data classified as not public. If the court issues an order to compel
compliance under this subdivision, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the commissioner
of administration.
   (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty under this subdivision, the court shall
consider whether the government entity has substantially complied with general data practices
under this chapter, including but not limited to, whether the government entity has:
     (1) designated a responsible authority under section 13.02, subdivision 16;
     (2) designated a data practices compliance official under section 13.05, subdivision 13;
   (3) prepared the public document that names the responsible authority and describes the
records and data on individuals that are maintained by the government entity under section 13.05,
subdivision 1;
    (4) developed public access procedures under section 13.03, subdivision 2; procedures to
guarantee the rights of data subjects under section 13.05, subdivision 8; and procedures to ensure
that data on individuals are accurate and complete and to safeguard the data's security under section
13.05, subdivision 5;

Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and disseminated through the criminal justice information
system, including, but not limited to fingerprints, photographs, identification data, arrest data,
prosecution data, criminal court data, custody and supervision data.

statewide systems are classified as private, pursuant to section 13.02, subdivision 12, except that
data created, collected, or maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that identify an
individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted,
associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement
information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the
offense. If an individual's name or other identifying information is erroneously associated with a
criminal history and a determination is made through a fingerprint verification that the individual is
not the subject of the criminal history, the name or other identifying information must be redacted
from the public criminal history data. The name and other identifying information must be retained
in the criminal history and are classified as private data.

list.
    Subd. 3. Bureau responsibilities. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall provide the
following information at a public Internet site:
