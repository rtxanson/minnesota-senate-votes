   That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 238 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:

    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.413, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Indoor area. "Indoor area" means all space between a floor and a ceiling that is
bounded by walls, doorways, or windows, whether open or closed, covering more than 50 percent
of the combined surface area of the vertical planes constituting the perimeter of the area. A wall
includes any retractable divider, garage door, or other physical barrier, whether temporary or
permanent. A 0.011 gauge window screen with an 18 by 16 mesh count is not a wall.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.413, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Place of employment. "Place of employment" means any indoor area at which two
or more individuals perform any type of a service for consideration of payment under any type
of contractual relationship, including, but not limited to, an employment relationship with or for a
private corporation, partnership, individual, or government agency. Place of employment includes
any indoor area where two or more individuals gratuitously perform services for which individuals
are ordinarily paid. A place of employment includes, but is not limited to, public conveyances,
factories, warehouses, offices, retail stores, restaurants, bars, banquet facilities, theaters, food stores,
banks, financial institutions, employee cafeterias, lounges, auditoriums, gymnasiums, restrooms,
elevators, hallways, museums, libraries, bowling establishments, employee medical facilities, and
rooms or areas containing photocopying equipment or other office equipment used in common.
Vehicles used in whole or in part for work purposes are places of employment during hours of
operation if more than one person is present. An area in which work is performed in a private
residence is a place of employment during hours of operation if:
   (1) the homeowner uses the area exclusively and regularly as a principal place of business and
has one or more on-site employees; or
    (2) the homeowner uses the area exclusively and regularly as a place to meet or deal with patients,
clients, or customers in the normal course of the homeowner's trade or business.

by five-sixteenths of one percent on sales and uses taxable under the general state sales and use tax
law. Receipts from the increase, plus penalties and interest and reduced by any refunds, are dedicated
as follows: 40 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in the heritage enhancement fund and may be
spent only to preserve, enhance, or protect the state's fish, wildlife, habitat, land, and forest resources;
and 60 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in the great outdoors Minnesota fund and may be
