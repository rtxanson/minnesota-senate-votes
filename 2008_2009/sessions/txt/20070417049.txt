displaced residents must be informed that they may be eligible for payments from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund under section 462A.40 as compensation for reasonable
relocation costs under subdivision 13, paragraphs (a) and (e).
   The governing body of the municipality may also require that other parties, including the
municipality, but excluding the park owner or its purchaser, involved in the park closing provide
additional compensation to residents to mitigate the adverse financial impact of the park closing
upon the residents.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund. (a) If
a manufactured home owner is required to move due to the conversion of all or a portion of a
manufactured home park to another use, the closure of a park, or cessation of use of the land as
a manufactured home park, the manufactured home park owner shall, upon such change in use,
pay to the commissioner of finance for deposit in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation
trust fund under section 462A.40, the lesser amount of the actual costs of moving or purchasing
the manufactured home under subdivision 13, paragraph (a) or (e), or $3,250 for each single
section manufactured home, and $6,000 for each multisection manufactured home, for which a
manufactured home owner has made application for payment of relocation costs under subdivision
13, paragraph (c). The manufactured home park owner shall make payments required under this
section to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund within 60 days of receipt, from
the home owner, of documentation of relocation costs under subdivision 13, paragraph (a) or (e).
   (b) A manufactured home park owner is not required to make the payment prescribed under
paragraph (a), nor is a manufactured home owner entitled to compensation under subdivision 13,
paragraph (a) or (e), if:
    (1) the manufactured home park owner relocates the manufactured home owner to another space
in the manufactured home park or to another manufactured home park at the park owner's expense;
   (2) the manufactured home owner is vacating the premises and has informed the manufactured
home park owner or manager of this prior to the mailing date of the closure statement under
subdivision 1;

    (3) a manufactured home owner has abandoned the manufactured home, or the manufactured
home owner is not current on the monthly lot rental, personal property taxes, or has failed to pay
the annual $12 payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund when due;
    (4) the manufactured home owner has a pending eviction action for nonpayment of lot rental
amount under section 327C.09, which was filed against the manufactured home owner prior to the
mailing date of the closure statement under subdivision 1, and the writ of recovery has been ordered
by the district court;
    (5) the conversion of all or a portion of a manufactured home park to another use, the closure
of a park, or cessation of use of the land as a manufactured home park is the result of a taking or
exercise of the power of eminent domain by a governmental entity or public utility; or
    (6) the owner of the manufactured home is not a resident of the manufactured home park, as
defined in section 327C.01, subdivision 9, or the owner of the manufactured home is a resident, but
came to reside in the manufactured home park after the mailing date of the closure statement under
subdivision 1.
    (c) Owners of manufactured homes who rent lots in a manufactured home park shall make annual
payments to the park owner, to be deposited in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust
fund under section 462A.40, in the amount of $12 per year, per manufactured home, payable on
August 15 of each year. On or before July 15 of each year, the commissioner of finance shall prepare
and forward to the park owner for circulation to its residents, a generic invoice and cover letter
explaining the purpose of the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund, the obligation
of each manufactured home owner to make an annual $12 payment into the fund, the due date,
and the need to pay to the park owner for collection, and a warning, in 14-point font, that if the
annual payments are not made when due, the manufactured home owner will not be eligible for
compensation from the fund if the manufactured home community closes. The park owner shall
receive, record, and commingle the payments and forward the payments to the commissioner of
finance by September 15 of each year, with a summary by the park owner, certifying the name,
address, and payment amount of each remitter, and noting the names and addresses of manufactured
home owners who did not pay the $12 annual payment. The commissioner of finance shall deposit
the payments in the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 13. Change in use, relocation expenses; payments by park owner. (a) If a manufactured
home owner is required to relocate due to the conversion of all or a portion of a manufactured
home park to another use, the closure of a manufactured home park, or cessation of use of the land
as a manufactured home park under subdivision 1, and the manufactured home owner complies
with the requirements of this section, the manufactured home owner is entitled to payment from
the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund equal to the manufactured home owner's
actual relocation costs for relocating the manufactured home to a new location within a 25-mile
radius of the park that is being closed, up to a maximum of $4,000 for a single-section and $8,000
for a multisection manufactured home. The actual relocation costs must include the reasonable cost
of taking down, moving, and setting up the manufactured home, including equipment rental, utility
connection and disconnection charges, minor repairs, modifications necessary for transportation of
the home, necessary moving permits and insurance, and moving costs for any appurtenances, which
meet applicable local, state, and federal building and construction codes.

   (b) A manufactured home owner is not entitled to compensation under paragraph (a) if the
manufactured home park owner is not required to make a payment to the Minnesota manufactured
home relocation trust fund under subdivision 12, paragraph (b).
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e), in order to obtain payment from the Minnesota
manufactured home relocation trust fund, the manufactured home owner shall submit to the
Housing Finance Agency, with a copy to the park owner, an application for payment, which
includes:
   (1) a copy of the closure statement under subdivision 1;
   (2) a copy of the contract with a moving or towing contractor, which includes the relocation
costs for relocating the manufactured home;
   (3) a statement with supporting materials of any additional relocation costs as outlined in
subdivision 1;
   (4) a statement certifying that none of the exceptions to receipt of compensation under
subdivision 12, paragraph (b), apply to the manufactured home owner;
    (5) a statement from the manufactured park owner that the lot rental is current and that the annual
$12 payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund has been paid when due;
and
   (6) a statement from the county where the manufactured home is located certifying that personal
property taxes for the manufactured home are paid through the end of that year.
    (d) Upon receipt of the application and supporting documentation under paragraph (c), the
Housing Finance Agency shall issue a check to the home owner for the amount of the contract price
for relocating the manufactured home and additional certified costs associated with third party
vendors, that were necessary in relocating the manufactured home, up to the maximum amounts
in paragraph (a).
    (e) In lieu of collecting a relocation payment from the Minnesota manufactured home relocation
trust fund under paragraph (a), the manufactured home owner may collect an amount from the fund
after reasonable efforts to relocate the manufactured home have failed due to the age or condition of
the manufactured home, or because there are no manufactured home parks willing or able to accept
the manufactured home within a 25-mile radius. A manufactured home owner may tender title of
the manufactured home in the manufactured home park to the manufactured home park owner, and
collect an amount to be determined by an independent appraisal. The appraiser must be agreed to
by both the manufactured home park owner and the manufactured home owner. The amount that
may be reimbursed under the fund is a maximum of $5,000 for a single-section, and $9,000 for a
multisection manufactured home. The manufactured home owner shall deliver to the manufactured
home park owner the current certificate of title to the manufactured home duly endorsed by the
owner of record, and valid releases of all liens shown on the certificate of title, and a statement from
the county where the manufactured home is located evidencing that the personal property taxes have
been paid. The manufactured home owner's application for funds under this paragraph must include
a document certifying that the manufactured home cannot be relocated, that the lot rental is current,
that the annual $12 payment to the Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund has been
paid when due, the manufactured home owner has chosen to tender title under this section, and that
49TH DAY]                           TUESDAY, APRIL 17, 2007                                       2183

the park owner agrees to make a payment to the commissioner of finance in the amount established
in subdivision 12, paragraph (a), less any costs required for demolition and removal of the home,
and any debris or refuse left on the lot, not to exceed $1,500. The manufactured home owner must
also provide a copy of the certificate of title endorsed by the owner of record, and certify to the
Housing Finance Agency, with a copy to the park owner, that none of the exceptions to receipt of
compensation under subdivision 12, paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (6), apply to the manufactured
home owner, and that the home owner will vacate the home within 60 days after receipt of payment
or the date of park closure, whichever is earlier, provided that the monthly lot rent is kept current.
    (f) The Housing Finance Agency is not liable to any person for recovery if the funds in the
Minnesota manufactured home relocation trust fund are insufficient to pay the amounts claimed. In
such event, the Housing Finance Agency shall keep a record of the time and date of its receipt of
application for payment from a claimant. If sufficient funds become available, the Housing Finance
Agency shall pay the manufactured home owner whose unpaid claim is the earliest by time and date
of the receipt of application.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Payment adjustment for smaller manufactured home parks. The total contribution
to the fund under section 462A.40 paid by the park owner under subdivision 12, paragraph (a), must
not exceed 20 percent of the sale price, or if no sale price is available, the assessed value of the
manufactured home park, except that if the sale price, or if there is no sale price, the assessed value,
is:
   (1) less than $100,000, the manufactured home park owner's contribution to the fund must not
exceed five percent of the sale price of the manufactured home park;
    (2) less than $200,000, the owner's contribution to the fund must not exceed eight percent of the
sale price of the manufactured home park;
    (3) less than $300,000, the owner's contribution to the fund must not exceed ten percent of the
sale price of the manufactured home park; and
    (4) less than $500,000, the owner's contribution to the fund must not exceed 15 percent of the
sale price of the manufactured home park.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 327C.095, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 15. Preemption of local ordinances. (a) This statute preempts and supersedes any local,
township, county, or municipal ordinances with regard to the closure or relocation or buy out
payments paid in the course of a change of use or closure of manufactured home communities. A
municipality, township, or county must not adopt an ordinance requiring more compensation by
the manufactured home park owners or its purchaser than what is provided for in this statute.
    (b) The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency must make a determination by September 15, 2007,

facility, that entity must report by individual facility. Reports must include only services that
were billed by the provider of diagnostic imaging services submitting the report. If a diagnostic
imaging facility leases capacity, technical services, or professional services to one or more other
providers of diagnostic imaging services, each provider must submit a separate annual report to
the commissioner for all diagnostic imaging services that it provided and billed. The owner of the
leased capacity must provide a report listing the names and addresses of providers to whom the
diagnostic imaging services and equipment were leased.

inquire in person about the funeral goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services
or prices offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must give the list upon beginning
discussion of either the prices of or the overall type of funeral service or disposition or specific
funeral goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services offered by the provider. This
requirement applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral establishment or elsewhere.
However, when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral establishment, an in-person
request for authorization to embalm does not, by itself, trigger the requirement to offer the general
price list. If the provider, in making an in-person request for authorization to embalm, discloses that
embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, the provider is not required to offer
the general price list. Any other discussion during that time about prices or the selection of funeral
goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services triggers the requirement to give the
consumer a general price list. The general price list must contain the following information:

provides the container;

    (h
     ­­) Upon receiving actual notice of the death of an individual with whom a funeral provider
has entered a preneed funeral agreement, the funeral provider must provide a copy of all preneed
funeral agreement documents to the person who controls final disposition of the human remains or
to the designee of the person controlling disposition. The person controlling final disposition shall
be provided with these documents at the time of the person's first in-person contact with the funeral
provider, if the first contact occurs in person at a funeral establishment, crematory, or other place
of business of the funeral provider. If the contact occurs by other means or at another location, the
documents must be provided within 24 hours of the first contact.
     Sec. 36. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.71, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
      Subd. 4. Casket, alternate container, and cremation container sales; records; required
disclosures. Any funeral provider who sells or offers to sell a casket, alternate container, or
cremation container, or cremated remains container to the public must maintain a record of each
sale that includes the name of the purchaser, the purchaser's mailing address, the name of the
decedent, the date of the decedent's death, and the place of death. These records shall be open

seeking approval to embalm, the funeral provider must disclose that embalming is not required by
law except in certain circumstances; that a fee will be charged if a funeral is selected which requires
embalming, such as a funeral with viewing; and that no embalming fee will be charged if the family
selects a service which does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate burial.
     Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.80, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Advance directives and will of decedent. A person may direct the preparation
for, type, or place of that person's final disposition, either by oral or written instructions. A person
may arrange for the preparation, type of service, and place of final disposition in advance of
need with a funeral establishment by written instructions that are dated, signed, and notarized
or witnessed. The person or persons otherwise entitled to control the final disposition under this
chapter shall faithfully carry out the reasonable and otherwise lawful directions of the decedent to
the extent that the decedent has provided resources for the purpose of carrying out the directions.
If the instructions are contained in a will, they shall be immediately carried out, regardless of the
validity of the will in other respects or of the fact that the will may not be offered for or admitted
to probate until a later date, subject to other provisions of this chapter or any other law of this state.
This subdivision shall be administered and construed so that the reasonable and lawful instructions
of the decedent or the person entitled to control the final disposition shall be faithfully and promptly
performed.
     Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.80, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Determination of right to control and duty of disposition. The right to control the
disposition of the remains of a deceased person, including the location and conditions of final
disposition, unless other directions have been given by the decedent pursuant to subdivision 1, vests
in, and the duty of final disposition of the body devolves upon, the following in the order named:
    (1) the person or persons appointed in a dated written instrument signed by the decedent. Written
instrument includes, but is not limited to, a health care directive executed under chapter 145C.
Written instrument does not include a durable or nondurable power of attorney which terminates on
the death of the principal pursuant to sections 523.08 and 523.09;
     (2) the surviving, legally recognized spouse;
     (3) a majority of the surviving biological or adopted child or children of the decedent over the

age of majority, provided that, in the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary, a funeral director
or mortician may rely on instructions given by the child or children who represent that they are the
sole surviving child, or that they constitute a majority of the surviving children;
    (4) the surviving parent or parents of the decedent each having equal authority;
    (5) a majority of the surviving biological or adopted sibling or siblings of the decedent over the
age of majority, provided that, in the absence of actual knowledge to the contrary, a funeral director
or mortician may rely on instructions given by the sibling or siblings who represent that they are the
sole surviving sibling, or that they constitute a majority of the surviving siblings;
    (6) the person or persons respectively in the next degree of kinship in the order named by law
to inherit the estate of the decedent; and
    (7) the appropriate public or court authority, as required by law.
    For purposes of this subdivision, the appropriate public or court authority includes the county
board of the county in which the death occurred if the person dies without apparent financial means
to provide for final disposition or the district court in the county in which the death occurred.
    Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.80, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Estranged persons. An estranged person gives up their rights according to subdivision
2, clauses (1) to (6). Where there is only one person in a degree of relationship to the decedent
described in subdivision 2, clauses (1) to (6), and a district court pursuant to subdivision 5,
determines that the person and the decedent were estranged at the time of death, the right to control
and the duty of disposition shall devolve to the person or persons in the next degree of relationship
pursuant to subdivision 2, clauses (1) to (6). For purposes of this subdivision, "estranged" means
having a relationship characterized by mutual enmity, hostility, or indifference.
    Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.90, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Death record. (a) Except as provided in this section, a death record must be
completed and filed for every known death by the mortician, funeral director, or other person
lawfully in charge of the final disposition of the body.
    (b) If the body is that of an individual whose identity is unknown, the person in charge of the
final disposition of the body must notify the commissioner for purposes of compliance with section
144.05, subdivision 4.

entity to which custody is transferred. The funeral establishment releasing the custody of the remains
shall retain a copy of the certificate of removal for a period of three calendar years following the date
of the transfer of custody. Following this period, and subject to any other laws requiring retention of
records, the funeral establishment may then place the records in storage or reduce them to microfilm,
microfiche, laser disc, or any other method that can produce an accurate reproduction of the original
record, for retention for a period of ten calendar years from the date of the removal of the body.
At the end of this period and subject to any other laws requiring retention of records, the funeral
establishment may destroy the records by shredding, incineration, or any other manner that protects
the privacy of the individuals identified in the records.

    (5) if used for the transportation of more than one dead human body at one time, the vehicle must
be designed so that a body or container does not rest directly on top of another body or container and

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under a
replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a local
governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by the
board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481, under
a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. Mining
reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
    For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the

    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, the local government
unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at least ten years unless
the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local government unit may
require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk of conversion to a
nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity to a municipality
or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.

the filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on-site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.

documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.

the petition and notice of hearing on the challenged voter. If the absentee ballot application was
submitted on behalf of a voter by an individual authorized under section 203B.17, subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), the county auditor must attempt to notify the individual who submitted the application
of the challenge. The county auditor may contact other registered voters to request information that
may resolve any discrepancies appearing in the application. All reasonable doubt shall be resolved
in favor of the validity of the application. If the voter's challenge is affirmed, the county auditor shall
provide the challenged voter with a copy of the petition and the decision and shall inform the voter
of the right to appeal as provided in section 201.195."

The county auditor must establish an absentee ballot board for ballots issued under sections 203B.16
to 203B.27. The board may consist of staff trained and certified as election judges, in which case,
the board is exempt from sections 204B.19, subdivision 5, and 204C.15, relating to party balance in
appointment of judges and to duties to be performed by judges of different major political parties.
    Subd. 2. Duties. The absentee ballot board must examine all returned absentee ballot envelopes
for ballots issued under sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 and accept or reject the absentee ballots in the
manner provided in section 203B.24.
    The absentee ballot board must examine the return envelopes and mark them "accepted" or
"rejected" during the 30 days before the election. If an envelope has been rejected at least five days
before the election, the ballots in the envelope must be considered spoiled ballots and the official in
charge of the absentee ballot board must provide the voter with a replacement absentee ballot and

license or state identification card number as submitted on the application, if the voter has one of
these documents; and
     (4) the voter has not already voted at that election, either in person or by absentee ballot.
    If the identification number described in clause (3) does not match the number as submitted
on the application, the election judges must make a reasonable effort to satisfy themselves through
other information provided by the applicant, or by an individual authorized to apply on behalf of
the voter, that the ballots were returned by the same person to whom the ballots were transmitted.

                          e cast pursuant to sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 may only be rejected for
the lack of one of clauses (1) to (4). In particular, failure to place the ballot within the security
envelope before placing it in the outer white envelope is not a reason to reject an absentee ballot.
   Election judges must note the reason for rejection on the back of the envelope in the space
provided for that purpose.
    Failure to return unused ballots shall not invalidate a marked ballot, but a ballot shall not be
                ffi

counted if the ­ ­d ­­

                      ­­t
the provisions of the Minnesota Election Law governing deposit and counting of ballots shall apply.

ELECTION DAY PROCEDURES.
    Subdivision 1. Death of voter. If the election judges receive proof that a voter who has returned
an absentee ballot as provided in sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 has died before the time when voting
is scheduled to begin on election day, the ballot of that voter shall be returned by the election judges
with the rejected ballots. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the counting of the
absentee ballot of a deceased voter shall not invalidate the election.
   Subd. 2. Voting more than once. If a voter whose application has been recorded under section
203B.19 casts a ballot in person on election day, an absentee ballot from that voter must not be
counted. If more than one return envelope is received from a voter whose application has been
recorded under section 203B.19, the ballots in the return envelope bearing the latest date must be
counted and the uncounted ballots must be returned by the election judges with the rejected ballots.
      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 203B.26, is amended to read:
      203B.26 SEPARATE RECORD.
    A separate record of the ballots of absent voters cast under sections 203B.16 to 203B.27 must
   ­­
be k  ­­
     ep t­­n
          i­ generated from the statewide registration system for each precinct and provided to the
election judges in the polling place on election day, along with the returned envelopes marked
"accepted" by the absentee ballot board. The content of the record must be in a form prescribed by
the secretary of state. The election judges in the polling place must note on the record any envelopes
that had been marked "accepted" by the absentee ballot board but were not counted. The election
judges must preserve the record and return it to the county auditor or municipal clerk with the
election day materials."

      "Sec. 16. REPEALER.
      Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 203B.16, subdivision 3, is repealed."
      Renumber the sections in sequence and correct the internal references
      Amend the title accordingly
      The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.

     Subd. 3. Deficient registration. No voter registration application is deficient if it contains

Minnesota state identification number, or if the voter has no current and valid Minnesota driver's
license or Minnesota state identification number, the last four digits of the voter's Social Security
number, if the voter has been issued a Social Security number, prior registration, if any, and
signature. The absence of a zip code number does not cause the registration to be deficient.
Failure to check a box on an application form that a voter has certified to be true does not cause
the registration to be deficient. The election judges shall request an individual to correct a voter
registration application if it is deficient or illegible o  ­­

                                                 t No eligible voter may be prevented from voting unless
the voter's registration application is deficient or the voter is duly and successfully challenged in
accordance with section 201.195 or 204C.12.
    A voter registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, is not deficient for lack
of date of birth. The county or municipality may attempt to obtain the date of birth for a voter
registration application accepted prior to August 1, 1983, by a request to the voter at any time
except at the polling place. Failure by the voter to comply with this request does not make the
registration deficient.
    A voter registration application accepted before January 1, 2004, is not deficient for lack
of a valid Minnesota driver's license or state identification number or the last four digits of a
Social Security number. A voter registration application submitted by a voter who does not have
a Minnesota driver's license or state identification number, or a Social Security number, is not
deficient for lack of any of these numbers.

    Subd. 2. Combined polling place. When no other election is being held in two or more precincts
on the day of a school district election, the school board may designate one or more combined
polling places at which the voters in those precincts may vote in the school district election. In school

a combined polling place for a school general election must be arranged so that it does not include
more than one board member election district.

electronic voting system is used and the county auditor of a county in which an electronic voting
system is used in more than one municipality and the county auditor of a county in which a counting
center serving more than one municipality is located shall prepare a plan which indicates acquisition
of sufficient facilities, computer time, and professional services and which describes the proposed
manner of complying with section 206.80. The plan must be signed, notarized, and submitted to
the secretary of state more than 60 days before the first election at which the municipality uses
an electronic voting system. Prior to July 1 of each subsequent general election year, the clerk or
auditor shall submit to the secretary of state notification of any changes to the plan on file with the
secretary of state. The secretary of state shall review each plan for its sufficiency and may request
technical assistance from the Department of Administration or other agency which may be operating
as the central computer authority. The secretary of state shall notify each reporting authority of the
sufficiency or insufficiency of its plan within 20 days of receipt of the plan. The attorney general,
upon request of the secretary of state, may seek a district court order requiring an election official
to fulfill duties imposed by this subdivision or by rules promulgated pursuant to this section.

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 85.054, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 13. Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area. A state park permit is not required and a fee
may not be charged for motor vehicle entry or parking at Croft Mine Historical Park and Portsmouth
Mine Lake Overlook in Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area, except for overnight camping.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103F.205, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

     Sec. 5. [103F.227] SHORELAND DEVELOPMENT; EXISTING RESORTS.
    Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies statewide and preempts local ordinances
that are inconsistent with its terms, but does not preempt local ordinances that provide additional
protection of shoreland.
    Subd. 2. Resort defined. For purposes of this section, "resort" means a shoreland commercial
establishment, existing on or before August 1, 2007, that includes buildings, lodges, structures,
dwelling units, camping or recreational vehicle sites, or enclosures, or any part thereof kept, used,
maintained, or advertised as or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations
are furnished to the public, primarily to persons seeking recreation, for periods of one day or longer,
and having for rent three or more cabins, rooms, campsites, or enclosures. A shoreland commercial
establishment must be primarily service oriented for transient lodging of guests. All cabins, rooms,
dwelling units, camping or recreational vehicle sites, or enclosures must be included in the resort
rental business. Resorts must not allow residential use of a dwelling unit or site, except dwellings
used as residences for the service providers. To qualify as a resort under this section, a resort must
be fully licensed and permitted under appropriate state and local regulations. The entire parcel of
land must be controlled and managed by the licensee.
    Subd. 3. Maintenance and replacement. (a) So long as the establishment continues to operate
as a resort, a county or municipality must allow a resort owner to:
    (1) maintain structures, including the replacement of aging or outdated components or systems
of the structure, while not increasing the structure's footprint on the land; and
     (2) replace structures damaged or lost to fire or natural disaster.
   (b) Paragraph (a), clause (2), applies only when an application for a building permit is made
within 180 days of the damage or loss.
    Subd. 4. Expansion. A county or municipality must allow a resort owner to increase a structure
footprint to minimally meet federal, state, or local dwelling standards or codes. To "minimally meet"
the standards or codes means that the replacement structure does not add new architectural elements,
such as more bedrooms, that did not exist in the original structure. Structural expansion under this
subdivision must not result in the structure being any larger than required to meet standards or codes

or the structure or any portion thereof being any closer to the shoreline than prior to the expansion.
   Subd. 5. Change in ownership. A change in ownership of a resort shall not be construed as a
conversion to a different use so long as the new owner continues to use the property as a resort.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.291, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

the public resource.
    (f) Until August 1, 2008, the commissioner shall not issue a new license to raise minnows
in a water body if the water body is the subject of a protective easement or other interest in

    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.405, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Personal possession. (a) A person acting under a license or traveling from an area where
a licensed activity was performed must have in personal possession either: (1) the proper license,
if the license has been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification
number or stamp validation, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but the
actual license has not been issued and received.
    (b) If possession of a license or a license identification number is required, a person must exhibit,
as requested by a conservation officer or peace officer, either: (1) the proper license if the license has
been issued to and received by the person; or (2) the proper license identification number or stamp
validation and a valid state driver's license, state identification card, or other form of identification
provided by the commissioner, if the license has been sold to the person by electronic means but
the actual license has not been issued and received. A person charged with violating the license
possession requirement shall not be convicted if the person produces in court or the office of the
arresting officer, the actual license previously issued to that person, which was valid at the time
of arrest, or satisfactory proof that at the time of the arrest the person was validly licensed. Upon
request of a conservation officer or peace officer, a licensee shall write the licensee's name in the
presence of the officer to determine the identity of the licensee.
    (c) If the actual license has been issued and received, a receipt for license fees, a copy of a
license, or evidence showing the issuance of a license, including the license identification number
or stamp validation, does not entitle a licensee to exercise the rights or privileges conferred by a
license.
    (d) A license or stamp issued electronically and not immediately provided to the licensee shall
be mailed to the licensee within 30 days of purchase of the license or stamp validation, except for a
pictorial turkey stamp or a pictorial trout and salmon stamp. A pictorial turkey stamp or a pictorial
trout and salmon stamp shall be mailed to the licensee after purchase of a license or stamp validation
only if the licensee pays an additional $2 fee.

change zone, license, or season options. The commissioner may issue a replacement license if the
applicant submits the original deer license and unused tags that are being replaced and the applicant
pays any increase in cost between the original and the replacement license. A refund of the difference
in fees may be issued when a person changes from a regular deer license to a youth deer license.
When a person submits both an archery and a firearms license for replacement, the commissioner

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 15.99, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Application; extensions. (a) The time limit in subdivision 2 begins upon the agency's
receipt of a written request containing all information required by law or by a previously adopted
rule, ordinance, or policy of the agency, including the applicable application fee. If an agency
receives a written request that does not contain all required information, the 60-day limit starts over
only if the agency sends written notice within 15 business days of receipt of the request telling the
requester what information is missing.
    (b) If a request relating to zoning, septic systems, watershed district review, soil and water
conservation district review, or expansion of the metropolitan urban service area requires the
approval of more than one state agency in the executive branch, the 60-day period in subdivision
2 begins to run for all executive branch agencies on the day a request containing all required
information is received by one state agency. The agency receiving the request must forward copies
to other state agencies whose approval is required.
    (c) An agency response, including an approval with conditions, meets the 60-day time limit if
the agency can document that the response was sent within 60 days of receipt of the written request.
Failure to satisfy the conditions, if any, may be a basis to revoke or rescind the approval by the
agency and will not give rise to a claim that the 60-day time limit was not met.
    (d) The time limit in subdivision 2 is extended if a state statute, federal law, or court order
requires a process to occur before the agency acts on the request, and the time periods prescribed in
the state statute, federal law, or court order make it impossible to act on the request within 60 days.
In cases described in this paragraph, the deadline is extended to 60 days after completion of the
last process required in the applicable statute, law, or order. Final approval of an agency receiving
a request is not considered a process for purposes of this paragraph.
    (e) The time limit in subdivision 2 is extended if: (1) a request submitted to a state agency
requires prior approval of a federal agency; or (2) an application submitted to a city, county, town,
school district, metropolitan or regional entity, or other political subdivision requires prior approval
of a state or federal agency. In cases described in this paragraph, the deadline for agency action is
extended to 60 days after the required prior approval is granted.
   (f) An agency may extend the time limit in subdivision 2 before the end of the initial 60-day

in less than 50 percent areas, and wetlands affected in the seven-county metropolitan area must be
replaced at a ratio of two to one in: (i) the affected county or, (ii) in another of the seven metropolitan
counties, or (iii) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially within the seven-county
metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the seven-county metropolitan
area.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in greater than 80 percent areas
may follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) by wetland banking after evaluating on-site
replacement and replacement within the watershed; (2) replaced in an adjacent wetland bank service
area if wetland bank credits are not reasonably available in the same wetland bank service area as
the affected wetland, as determined by the local government unit or by a comprehensive inventory
approved by the board; and (3) statewide.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in the seven-county metropolitan
area must follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) in the affected county; (2) in another of
the seven metropolitan counties; or (3) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially
within the seven-county metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the

    (­) (e) When reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities
     c­
are not available in siting priorities listed in paragraph (a), the applicant may seek opportunities at
the next level.
   ­(d
     ­­) (f) For the purposes of this section, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial
replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
      (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.

     e­
      ) (g) Regulatory agencies, local government units, and other entities involved in wetland
restoration shall collaborate to identify potential replacement opportunities within their
jurisdictional areas.

    (1) new placement or maintenance, repair, enhancement, or replacement of existing utility or
utility-type service, including pipelines, if:
    (i) the direct and indirect impacts of the proposed project have been avoided and minimized to
the extent possible; and
       (ii) the proposed project significantly modifies or alters less than one-half acre of wetlands;
    (2) activities associated with operation, routine maintenance, or emergency repair of existing
utilities and public work structures, including pipelines, provided the activities do not result in
additional wetland intrusion or additional draining or filling of a wetland either wholly or partially;
or
   (3) repair and updating of existing individual sewage treatment systems necessary to comply
with local, state, and federal regulations.
     (b) For maintenance, repair, and replacement, the local government unit may issue a seasonal or
annual exemption certification or the utility may proceed without local government unit certification
if the utility is carrying out the work according to approved best management practices. Work of an
emergency nature may proceed as necessary and any drain or fill activities shall be addressed with
the local government unit after the emergency work has been completed.
       Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.2241, subdivision 11, is amended to read:

     (1) appropriate erosion control measures are taken to prevent sedimentation of the water;
     (2) the activity does not block fish passage in a watercourse; and
    (3) the activity is conducted in compliance with all other applicable federal, state, and local
requirements, including best management practices and water resource protection requirements
established under chapter 103H.
    (b) An activity is exempt if it qualifies for any one of the exemptions, even though it may be
indicated as not exempt under another exemption.
   (c) Persons proposing to conduct an exempt activity are encouraged to contact the local
government unit or the local government unit's designee for advice on minimizing wetland impacts.
   (d) The board shall develop rules that provide for estimates and reporting of exempt wetland
impacts, including those in subdivisions 2, 6, and 9.
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.2242, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Evaluation. (a) Questions concerning the public value, location, size, or type of a
wetland shall be submitted to and determined by a Technical Evaluation Panel after an on-site
inspection. The Technical Evaluation Panel shall be composed of a technical professional employee
of the board, a technical professional employee of the local soil and water conservation district
or districts, a technical professional with expertise in water resources management appointed by
the local government unit, and a technical professional employee of the Department of Natural
Resources for projects affecting public waters or wetlands adjacent to public waters. The panel shall
use the "United States Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual" (January 1987),
including updates, supplementary guidance, and replacements, if any, "Wetlands of the United
States" (United States Fish and Wildlife Service Circular 39, 1971 edition), and "Classification of
Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States" (1979 edition). The panel shall provide the
wetland determination and recommendations on other technical matters to the local government
unit that must approve a replacement plan, wetland banking plan, exemption determination, no-loss
determination, or wetland boundary or type determination and may recommend approval or denial
of the plan. The authority must consider and include the decision of the Technical Evaluation Panel
in their approval or denial of a plan or determination.
      (b) Persons conducting wetland or public waters boundary delineations or type determinations
are exempt from the requirements of chapter 326. B                            ­y­­­J­an

    (c) The local government unit decision must be made in compliance with section 15.99.
Within ten calendar days of the decision, the local government unit decision must be mailed to
the landowner, members of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the watershed district or watershed
management organization, if one exists, and individual members of the public who request a copy.
    (d) Appeals of decisions made by designated local government staff must be made to the local
government unit. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a ruling on an appeal must be made by
the local government unit within 30 days from the date of the filing of the appeal.
   (e) The local government unit decision is valid for three years unless the Technical Evaluation
Panel determines that natural or artificial changes to the hydrology, vegetation, or soils of the area
have been sufficient to alter the wetland boundary or type.

returned to the petitioner. Appeal may be made by:
     (1) the wetland owner;
     (2) any of those to whom notice is required to be mailed under subdivision 7; or
     (3) 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.
   (b) Within 30 days after receiving a petition, the board shall decide whether to grant the petition
and hear the appeal. The board shall grant the petition unless the board finds that:
     (1) the appeal is meritless, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay;
     (2) the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies;
     (3) expanded technical review is needed;
     (4) the local government unit's record is not adequate; or
   (5) the petitioner has not posted a letter of credit, cashier's check, or cash if required by the local
government unit.
   (c) In determining whether to grant the appeal, the board shall also consider the size of the
wetland, other factors in controversy, any patterns of similar acts by the local government unit or

petitioner, and the consequences of the delay resulting from the appeal.
    (d) All appeals must be heard by the committee for dispute resolution of the board, and a decision
made within 60 days of filing the local government unit's record and the written briefs submitted for
the appeal. The decision must be served by mail on the parties to the appeal, and is not subject to
the provisions of chapter 14. A decision whether to grant a petition for appeal and a decision on the
merits of an appeal must be considered the decision of an agency in a contested case for purposes
of judicial review under sections 14.63 to 14.69.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the board shall establish a fee schedule to defray the
administrative costs of appeals made to the board under this subdivision. Fees established under
this authority shall not exceed $1,000. Establishment of the fee is not subject to the rulemaking
process of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.
      Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.2242, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
   Subd. 12. Replacement credits. (a) No public or private wetland restoration, enhancement, or
construction may be allowed for replacement unless specifically designated for replacement and
paid for by the individual or organization performing the wetland restoration, enhancement, or
construction, and is completed prior to any draining or filling of the wetland.
    (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to a wetland whose owner has paid back with interest the
individual or organization restoring, enhancing, or constructing the wetland.

    (1) reestablishment of permanent native, noninvasive vegetative cover on a wetland on
agricultural land that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation seeding of
pasture grasses or legumes, or was in a land retirement program during the past ten years;
   (2) buffer areas of permanent native, noninvasive vegetative cover established or preserved on
upland adjacent to replacement wetlands;

     Subd. 2. Plan contents. A comprehensive wetland protection and management plan may:
     (1) provide for classification of wetlands in the plan area based on:
     (i) an inventory of wetlands in the plan area;
    (ii) an assessment of the wetland functions listed in section 103B.3355, using a methodology
chosen by the Technical Evaluation Panel from one of the methodologies established or approved
by the board under that section; and
     (iii) the resulting public values;
    (2) vary application of the sequencing standards in section 103G.222, subdivision 1, paragraph
(b), for projects based on the classification and criteria set forth in the plan;
    (3) vary the replacement standards of section 103G.222, subdivision 1, paragraphs ­     (­

provided there is no net loss of public values within the area subject to the plan, and so long as:
    (i) in a 50 to 80 percent area, a minimum acreage requirement of one acre of replaced wetland
for each acre of drained or filled wetland requiring replacement is met within the area subject to the
plan; and
    (ii) in a less than 50 percent area, a minimum acreage requirement of two acres of replaced
wetland for each acre of drained or filled wetland requiring replacement is met within the area
subject to the plan, except that replacement for the amount above a 1:1 ratio can be accomplished
as described in section 103G.2242, subdivision 12; and
    (4) in a greater than 80 percent area, allow replacement credit, based on the classification and
criteria set forth in the plan, for any project that increases the public value of wetlands, including
activities on adjacent upland acres; ­­­

   Subdivision 1. Application. For the purposes of section 16B.328, the definitions in this section
have the meanings given.
    Subd. 2. Energy conservation. "Energy conservation" means reducing energy use and includes
using a light with lower wattage or time controls.
    Subd. 3. Cutoff luminaire. "Cutoff luminaire" means a luminaire in which 2.5 percent or less
of the lamp lumens are emitted above a horizontal plane through the luminaire's lowest part and ten
percent or less of the lamp lumens are emitted at a vertical angle 80 degrees above the luminaire's
lowest point.
    Subd. 4. Light pollution. "Light pollution" means the night sky glow caused by the scattering
of artificial light in the atmosphere.
    Subd. 5. Outdoor lighting fixture. "Outdoor lighting fixture" means any type of fixed or
movable lighting equipment that is designed or used for illumination outdoors. The term includes
billboard lighting, streetlights, searchlights, and other lighting used for advertising purposes and
area lighting. The term does not include lighting equipment that is required by law to be installed
on motor vehicles or lighting required for the safe operation of aircraft.
   Sec. 2. [16B.328] STANDARDS FOR STATE FUNDED OUTDOOR LIGHTING
FIXTURES; MODEL ORDINANCE.
    Subdivision 1. Outdoor lighting fixtures. (a) An outdoor lighting fixture may be installed or
replaced using state funds only if:
    (1) the new or replacement outdoor lighting fixture is a cutoff luminaire if the rated output of
the outdoor lighting fixture is greater than 1,800 lumens;
    (2) the minimum illuminance adequate for the intended purpose is used with consideration given
to nationally recognized standards;
    (3) for lighting of a designated highway of the state highway system, the Department of
Transportation determines that the purpose of the outdoor lighting fixture cannot be achieved by
the installation of reflective road markers, lines, warning or informational signs, or other effective
passive methods; and
   (4) full consideration has been given to energy conservation and savings, reducing glare,

minimizing light pollution, and preserving the natural night environment.
   (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply if:
   (1) a federal law, rule, or regulation preempts state law;
   (2) the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis because emergency personnel require
additional illumination for emergency procedures;
   (3) the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis for nighttime work;
    (4) special events or situations require additional illumination, provided that the illumination
installed shields the outdoor lighting fixtures from direct view and minimizes upward lighting and
light pollution;
    (5) the outdoor lighting fixture is used solely to highlight the aesthetic aspects of a single object
or distinctive building; or
   (6) a compelling safety interest exists that cannot be addressed by another method.
   (c) This subdivision does not apply to the operation and maintenance of lights or lighting systems
purchased or installed, or for which design work is completed, before August 1, 2007.
   (d) This section does not apply if a state agency or local unit of government determines that
compliance with this section would:
   (1) require an increased use of electricity;
   (2) increase the construction cost of a lighting system more than 15 percent over the construction
cost of a lighting system that does not comply with this section;
    (3) increase the cost of operation and maintenance of the lighting system more than ten percent
over the cost of operating and maintaining the existing lighting system over the life of the lighting
system; or
   (4) result in a negative safety impact.
   Subd. 2. Model ordinance. The commissioner of administration, in consultation with the
commissioner of commerce, associations for local governments, and any other interested person,
shall develop a model ordinance that can be adapted for use by cities, counties, and towns,
governing outdoor lighting to reduce light pollution. The model ordinance must include provisions
addressing elements similar to those in subdivision 1. In addition, the model ordinance must
address:
   (1) standards for lighting on private property, outdoor advertising, lighting on commercial,
industrial, or institutional property, canopies covering fueling stations, and public streets, sidewalks,
and alleys;
   (2) how illumination levels should be measured;
   (3) possible exemptions, such as for temporary emergency or hazard lighting;
   (4) recommended elements for an exterior lighting plan for a development;

   (5) treatment of nonconforming lighting;
   (6) lighting standards that might apply in special subdistricts;
   (7) light pole maximum heights; and
   (8) light trespass.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 115.56, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. License required. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), after March 31, 1996, a
person may not design, install, maintain, pump, or inspect an individual sewage treatment system
without a license issued by the commissioner.
   (b) A license is not required for a person who complies with the applicable requirements if the
person is:
    (1) a qualified employee of state or local government who has passed the examination described
in paragraph (d) or a similar examination;
    (2) an individual who constructs an individual sewage treatment system on land that is owned
or leased by the individual and functions solely as the individual's dwelling or seasonal dwelling;
    (3) a farmer who pumps and disposes of sewage waste from individual sewage treatment
systems, holding tanks, and privies on land that is owned or leased by the farmer; or
   (4) an individual who performs labor or services for a person licensed under this section in
connection with the design, installation, maintenance, pumping, or inspection of an individual
sewage treatment system at the direction and under the personal supervision of a person licensed
under this section.
    A person constructing an individual sewage treatment system under clause (2) must consult with
a site evaluator or designer before beginning construction. In addition, the system must be inspected
before being covered and a compliance report must be provided to the local unit of government after
the inspection.
    (c) The commissioner, in conjunction with the University of Minnesota Extension Service or
another higher education institution, shall ensure adequate training exists for individual sewage
treatment system professionals.
    (d) The commissioner shall conduct examinations to test the knowledge of applicants for
licensing and shall issue documentation of licensing.
    (e) Licenses may be issued only upon successful completion of the required examination and
submission of proof of sufficient experience, proof of general liability insurance, and a corporate
surety bond in the amount of at least $10,000.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), the examination and proof of experience are not required for
an individual sewage treatment system professional who, on the effective date of the rules adopted
under subdivision 1, holds a certification attained by examination and experience under a voluntary
certification program administered by the agency.
   (g) Local units of government may not require additional local licenses for individual sewage

    Subd. 3. Access to data by individual. Upon request to a responsible authority or designee, an
individual shall be informed whether the individual is the subject of stored data on individuals, and
whether it is classified as public, private or confidential. Upon further request, an individual who
is the subject of stored private or public data on individuals shall be shown the data without any
charge and, if desired, shall be informed of the content and meaning of that data. After an individual
has been shown the private data and informed of its meaning, the data need not be disclosed to that
individual for six months thereafter unless a dispute or action pursuant to this section is pending or
additional data on the individual has been collected or created. The responsible authority or designee
shall provide copies of the private or public data upon request by the individual subject of the data.
The responsible authority or designee may require the requesting person to pay the actual costs of
making, ­ and certifying,

   The responsible authority or designee shall comply immediately, if possible, with any request
made pursuant to this subdivision, or within ten days of the date of the request, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and legal holidays, if immediate compliance is not possible.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.04, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Procedure when data is not accurate or complete. (a) An individual subject of
the data may contest the accuracy or completeness of public or private data. To exercise this
right, an individual shall notify in writing the responsible authority describing the nature of the
disagreement. The responsible authority shall within 30 days either: (1) correct the data found
to be inaccurate or incomplete and attempt to notify past recipients of inaccurate or incomplete
data, including recipients named by the individual; or (2) notify the individual that the authority
believes the data to be correct. Data in dispute shall be disclosed only if the individual's statement
of disagreement is included with the disclosed data.
    The determination of the responsible authority may be appealed pursuant to the provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act relating to contested cases. Upon receipt of an appeal by an individual,
the commissioner shall, before issuing the order and notice of a contested case hearing required by
chapter 14, try to resolve the dispute through education, conference, conciliation, or persuasion. If
the parties consent, the commissioner may refer the matter to mediation. Following these efforts,
the commissioner shall dismiss the appeal or issue the order and notice of hearing.
   (b) Data on individuals that have been successfully challenged by an individual must be
completed, corrected, or destroyed by a ­s­a

international organization known as Interpol, except through the Interpol-United States National
Central Bureau, United States Department of Justice.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.072, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Opinion; when required. (a) Upon request of a government entity, the
commissioner may give a written opinion on any question relating to public access to government
data, rights of subjects of data, or classification of data under this chapter or other Minnesota
statutes governing government data practices. Upon request of any person who disagrees with a
determination regarding data practices made by a government entity, the commissioner may give
a written opinion regarding the person's rights as a subject of government data or right to have
access to government data.
    (b) Upon request of a body subject to chapter 13D, the commissioner may give a written opinion
on any question relating to the body's duties under chapter 13D. Upon request of a person who
disagrees with the manner in which members of a governing body perform their duties under chapter
13D, the commissioner may give a written opinion on compliance with chapter 13D. A governing
body or person requesting an opinion under this paragraph must pay the commissioner a fee of $200.
Money received by the commissioner under this paragraph is appropriated to the commissioner for
the purposes of this section.
    (c) If the commissioner determines that no opinion will be issued, the commissioner shall give
the government entity or body subject to chapter 13D or person requesting the opinion notice of the
decision not to issue the opinion within five business days of receipt of the request. If this notice is
not given, the commissioner shall issue an opinion within 20 days of receipt of the request.
    (d) For good cause and upon written notice to the person requesting the opinion, the
commissioner may extend this deadline for one additional 30-day period. The notice must state
the reason for extending the deadline. The government entity or the members of a body subject
to chapter 13D must be provided a reasonable opportunity to explain the reasons for its decision
regarding the data or how they perform their duties under chapter 13D. The commissioner or the
government entity or body subject to chapter 13D may choose to give notice to the subject of the
data concerning the dispute regarding the data or compliance with chapter 13D.
    (e) This section does not apply to a determination made by the commissioner of health under
section 13.3805, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), or 144.6581.
   (f) A written, numbered, and published opinion issued by the attorney general shall take
precedence over an opinion issued by the commissioner under this section.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.08, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Action to compel compliance. (a) In addition to the remedies provided in subdivisions
1 to 3 or any other law, any aggrieved person seeking to enforce the person's rights under this chapter
or obtain access to data may bring an action in district court to compel compliance with this chapter
and may recover costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, as determined by the
court. If the court determines that an action brought under this subdivision is frivolous and without
merit and a basis in fact, it may award reasonable costs and attorney fees to the responsible authority.
If the court issues an order to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court may impose a

civil penalty of up to $300 against the government entity. This penalty is payable to the state general
fund and is in addition to damages under subdivision 1. The matter shall be heard as soon as possible.
In an action involving a request for government data under section 13.03 or 13.04, the court may
inspect in camera the government data in dispute, but shall conduct its hearing in public and in a
manner that protects the security of data classified as not public. If the court issues an order to compel
compliance under this subdivision, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the commissioner
of administration.
   (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty under this subdivision, the court shall
consider whether the government entity has substantially complied with general data practices
under this chapter, including but not limited to, whether the government entity has:
     (1) designated a responsible authority under section 13.02, subdivision 16;
     (2) designated a data practices compliance official under section 13.05, subdivision 13;
   (3) prepared the public document that names the responsible authority and describes the
records and data on individuals that are maintained by the government entity under section 13.05,
subdivision 1;
    (4) developed public access procedures under section 13.03, subdivision 2; procedures to
guarantee the rights of data subjects under section 13.05, subdivision 8; and procedures to ensure
that data on individuals are accurate and complete and to safeguard the data's security under section
13.05, subdivision 5;

who are employees of the public body;
    (6) the terms of any agreement settling any dispute arising out of an employment relationship,

    Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.87, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Criminal history data. (a) Definition. For purposes of this subdivision,
"criminal history data" means all data maintained in criminal history records compiled by the
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and disseminated through the criminal justice information
system, including, but not limited to fingerprints, photographs, identification data, arrest data,
prosecution data, criminal court data, custody and supervision data.
    (b) Classification. Criminal history data maintained by agencies, political subdivisions and
statewide systems are classified as private, pursuant to section 13.02, subdivision 12, except that
data created, collected, or maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that identify an
individual who was convicted of a crime, the offense of which the individual was convicted,
associated court disposition and sentence information, controlling agency, and confinement
information are public data for 15 years following the discharge of the sentence imposed for the
offense. If an individual's name or other identifying information is erroneously associated with a
criminal history and a determination is made through a fingerprint verification that the individual is
not the subject of the criminal history, the name or other identifying information must be redacted
from the public criminal history data. The name and other identifying information must be retained
in the criminal history and are classified as private data.
   The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall provide to the public at the central office of the
bureau the ability to inspect in person, at no charge, through a computer monitor the criminal
conviction data classified as public under this subdivision.
