by Senator Senjem:
    Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.055, subdivision 12, is amended to read:
    Subd. 12. Disabled children. (a) A person is eligible for medical assistance if the person is under
age 19 and qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section 1382c(a), and
would be eligible for medical assistance under the state plan if residing in a medical institution, and
the child requires a level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility
for persons with developmental disabilities, for whom home care is appropriate, provided that the
cost to medical assistance under this section is not more than the amount that medical assistance
would pay for if the child resides in an institution. After the child is determined to be eligible under
this section, the commissioner shall review the child's disability under United States Code, title
42, section 1382c(a) and level of care defined under this section no more often than annually and
may elect, based on the recommendation of health care professionals under contract with the state
medical review team, to extend the review of disability and level of care up to a maximum of four
years. The commissioner's decision on the frequency of continuing review of disability and level of
care is not subject to administrative appeal under section 256.045. The county agency shall send a
notice of disability review to the enrollee six months prior to the date the recertification of disability
is due. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as affecting other redeterminations of medical
assistance eligibility under this chapter and annual cost-effective reviews under this section.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means an institution as defined in section
144.696, subdivision 3, 144.55, subdivision 3, or Minnesota Rules, part 4640.3600, and licensed
pursuant to sections 144.50 to 144.58. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of
care provided in a hospital if the child is determined by the commissioner to need an extensive
array of health services, including mental health services, for an undetermined period of time,
whose health condition requires frequent monitoring and treatment by a health care professional
or by a person supervised by a health care professional, who would reside in a hospital or require
frequent hospitalization if these services were not provided, and the daily care needs are more
complex than a nursing facility level of care.
8238                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [97TH DAY

    A child with serious emotional disturbance requires a level of care provided in a hospital if
the commissioner determines that the individual requires 24-hour supervision because the person
exhibits recurrent or frequent suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, recurrent or frequent
psychosomatic disorders or somatopsychic disorders that may become life threatening, recurrent or
frequent severe socially unacceptable behavior associated with psychiatric disorder, ongoing and
chronic psychosis or severe, ongoing and chronic developmental problems requiring continuous
skilled observation, or severe disabling symptoms for which office-centered outpatient treatment is
not adequate, and which overall severely impact the individual's ability to function.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "nursing facility" means a facility which provides nursing
care as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, licensed pursuant to sections 144A.02 to 144A.10,
which is appropriate if a person is in active restorative treatment; is in need of special treatments
provided or supervised by a licensed nurse; or has unpredictable episodes of active disease processes
requiring immediate judgment by a licensed nurse. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires
the level of care provided in a nursing facility if the child is determined by the commissioner to meet
the requirements of the preadmission screening assessment document under section 256B.0911 and
the home care independent rating document under section 256B.0655, subdivision 4, clause (3),
adjusted to address age-appropriate standards for children age 18 and under, pursuant to section
256B.0655, subdivision 3.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "intermediate care facility for persons with developmental
disabilities" or "ICF/MR" means a program licensed to provide services to persons with
developmental disabilities under section 252.28, and chapter 245A, and a physical plant licensed
as a supervised living facility under chapter 144, which together are certified by the Minnesota
Department of Health as meeting the standards in Code of Federal Regulations, title 42, part
483, for an intermediate care facility which provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities who require 24-hour supervision and active treatment for medical, behavioral, or
habilitation needs. For purposes of this subdivision, a child requires a level of care provided in an
ICF/MR if the commissioner finds that the child has a developmental disability in accordance with
section 256B.092, is in need of a 24-hour plan of care and active treatment similar to persons with
developmental disabilities, and there is a reasonable indication that the child will need ICF/MR
services.
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, a person requires the level of care provided in a nursing
facility if the person requires 24-hour monitoring or supervision and a plan of mental health
treatment because of specific symptoms or functional impairments associated with a serious mental
illness or disorder diagnosis, which meet severity criteria for mental health established by the
commissioner and published in March 1997 as the Minnesota Mental Health Level of Care for
Children and Adolescents with Severe Emotional Disorders.
    (f) The determination of the level of care needed by the child shall be made by the commissioner
based on information supplied to the commissioner by the parent or guardian, the child's physician
or physicians, and other professionals as requested by the commissioner. The commissioner shall
establish a screening team to conduct the level of care determinations according to this subdivision.
    (g) If a child meets the conditions in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e), the commissioner must assess
the case to determine whether:
   (1) the child qualifies as a disabled individual under United States Code, title 42, section

1382c(a), and would be eligible for medical assistance if residing in a medical institution; and
    (2) the cost of medical assistance services for the child, if eligible under this subdivision, would
not be more than the cost to medical assistance if the child resides in a medical institution to be
determined as follows:
    (i) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an ICF/MR, the cost of care for the child
in an institution shall be determined using the average payment rate established for the regional
treatment centers that are certified as ICF's/MR;
    (ii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in an inpatient hospital setting according to
paragraph (b), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3520,
items F and G; and
    (iii) for a child who requires a level of care provided in a nursing facility according to paragraph
(c) or (e), cost-effectiveness shall be determined according to Minnesota Rules, part 9505.3040,
except that the nursing facility average rate shall be adjusted to reflect rates which would be paid
for children under age 16. The commissioner may authorize an amount up to the amount medical
assistance would pay for a child referred to the commissioner by the preadmission screening team
under section 256B.0911.
    (h) Children eligible for medical assistance services under section 256B.055, subdivision 12, as
of June 30, 1995, must be screened according to the criteria in this subdivision prior to January 1,
1996. Children found to be ineligible may not be removed from the program until January 1, 1996."

    Subd. 9. Referendum revenue. (a) The revenue authorized by section 126C.10, subdivision
1, may be increased in the amount approved by the voters of the district at a referendum called
for the purpose. The referendum may be called by the board or shall be called by the board upon
written petition of qualified voters of the district. The referendum must be conducted one or two
calendar years before the increased levy authority, if approved, first becomes payable. Only one
election to approve an increase may be held in a calendar year. Unless the referendum is conducted
by mail under paragraph (g), the referendum must be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November. The ballot must state the maximum amount of the increased revenue per resident
marginal cost pupil unit. The ballot may state a schedule, determined by the board, of increased
revenue per resident marginal cost pupil unit that differs from year to year over the number of years
for which the increased revenue is authorized or may state that the amount shall increase annually
by the rate of inflation. For this purpose, the rate of inflation shall be the annual inflationary increase
calculated under subdivision 2, paragraph (b). The ballot may state that existing referendum levy
authority is expiring. In this case, the ballot may also compare the proposed levy authority to the
existing expiring levy authority, and express the proposed increase as the amount, if any, over the
expiring referendum levy authority. The ballot must designate the specific number of years, not to
exceed ten, for which the referendum authorization applies. The ballot, including a ballot on the
question to revoke or reduce the increased revenue amount under paragraph (c), must abbreviate
the term "per resident marginal cost pupil unit" as "per pupil." The notice required under section
275.60 may be modified to read, in cases of renewing existing levies at the same amount per pupil
as in the previous year:
