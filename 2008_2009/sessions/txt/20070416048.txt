   Sec. 9. [216F.081] APPLICATION OF COUNTY STANDARDS.
    A county may adopt by ordinance standards for LWECS that are more stringent than standards
in commission rules or in the commission's permit standards. The commission, in considering a
permit application for LWECS in a county that has adopted more stringent standards, shall consider
and apply those more stringent standards, unless the commission finds good cause not to apply the
standards.
   Sec. 10. STATEWIDE STUDY OF DISPERSED GENERATION POTENTIAL.
    Subdivision 1. Definition. "Dispersed generation" means an electric generation project with a
generating capacity between ten and 40 megawatts that utilizes an "eligible energy technology," as
defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.1691, subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 2. Study participants. Each electric utility subject to Minnesota Statutes, section
216B.1691, must participate collaboratively in conducting a two-phase study of the potential for
dispersed generation projects that can be developed in Minnesota.
    Subd. 3. First phase study content; report. In the first phase of the study, participants must
analyze the impacts of the addition of a total of 600 megawatts of new dispersed generation
projects distributed among the following Minnesota electric transmission planning zones: the
Northeast zone, the Northwest zone, the Southeast zone, the Southwest zone, and the West-Central
zone. Study participants must use a generally accepted 2010 year transmission system model
including all transmission facilities expected to be operating in 2010. The study must take into
consideration regional projected load growth, planned changes in the bulk transmission network,
and the long-range transmission conceptual plan being developed under Laws 2007, chapter 3,
section 2. In determining locations for the installation of dispersed generation projects that consist
of wind energy conversion systems, the study should consider, at a minimum, wind resource
availability, existing and contracted wind projects, and current dispersed generation projects in
the Midwest Independent System Operator interconnection queue. The study must analyze the
impacts of individual projects and all projects in aggregate on the transmission system, and identify
specific modifications to the transmission system necessary to remedy any problems caused by the
installation of dispersed generation projects, including cost estimates for the modifications. The
study must analyze the additional dispersed generation projects connected at the lowest voltage
level transmission that exists in the vicinity of the projected generation sites. A preliminary analysis
to identify transmission system problems must be conducted with the projects installed at initially
selected locations. The technical review committee may, after reviewing the locations selected for
installation, recommend moving the installation sites once to new locations to reduce undesirable
transmission system impacts. The commissioner of commerce must submit a report containing the
findings and recommendations of the first phase of the study to the commission no later than June
15, 2008.
   Subd. 4. Second phase study content; report. In the second phase of the study, participants
48TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007                                       2085

must analyze the impacts of an additional total of 600 megawatts of dispersed generation projects
installed among the five transmission planning zones, or a higher total capacity amount if agreed
to by both the utilities and the technical review committee. The utilities must employ an analysis
method similar to that used in the first phase of the study, and must use the most recent information
available, including information developed in the first phase. The second phase of the study must
use a generally accepted 2013 year transmission system model including all transmission facilities
that are expected to be in service at that time. The commissioner of commerce must submit a report
containing the findings and recommendations of the second phase of the study to the commission
no later than September 15, 2009.
    Subd. 5. Technical review committee. Prior to the start of the first phase of the study, the
commissioner of commerce must appoint a technical review committee consisting of between
ten and 15 individuals with experience and expertise in electric transmission system engineering,
renewable energy generation technology, and dispersed generation project development, including
representatives from the federal Department of Energy, the Midwest Independent System Operator,
and stakeholder interests. The technical review committee must oversee both phases of the study,
and must:
   (1) make recommendations to the utilities regarding the proposed methods and assumptions to
be used in the technical study;
    (2) in conjunction with the appropriate utilities, hold public meetings on each phase of the study
in each electricity transmission planning zone prior to the beginning of each phase of study, after
the impact analysis is completed, and when a draft final report is available;
   (3) establish procedures for handling commercially sensitive information; and
    (4) review the initial and final drafts of the study and make recommendations for improvement,
including problems associated with the interconnections among utility systems that may be
amenable to solution through cooperation between the utilities in each zone. During each phase
of the study, the technical review committee may recommend that the installation of dispersed
generation projects be moved to new locations that cause fewer undesirable transmission system
impacts.
   Sec. 11. WIND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY AGREEMENTS; STUDY.
    The Legislative Electric Energy Task Force shall study whether the state should regulate
easements, leases, and other agreements to acquire an interest in real property for the purpose of
wind energy development. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the duration and other
terms of those interests should be limited to promote wind energy development. The task force
must report the results of its study and any recommendations to the chairs of the energy finance
and policy committees of the legislature by February 1, 2008.
                                            ARTICLE 2
            GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE; GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
   Section 1. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal. (a) It is the goal of the state to reduce
statewide greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors producing those emissions to a level at least
2086                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [48TH DAY

80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050.
   (b) For purposes of this section, statewide greenhouse gas emissions include emissions of carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride
emitted by anthropogenic sources within the state and from the generation of electricity imported
from outside the state and consumed in Minnesota. Carbon dioxide that is injected into geological
formations to prevent its release to the atmosphere in compliance with applicable laws, and carbon
dioxide associated with the combustion of fuels other than coal, petroleum, and natural gas are not
counted as contributing to statewide greenhouse gas emissions.
    Subd. 2. Climate change action plan. By February 1, 2008, the commissioner of commerce, in
consultation with the commissioners of the Pollution Control Agency, the Housing Finance Agency,
and the Departments of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Employment and Economic Development,
and Transportation, and the chair of the Metropolitan Council, shall submit to the legislature a
climate change action plan that meets the requirements of this section.
    Subd. 3. Stakeholder process. The plan required by subdivision 2 must be developed through
a structured, broadly inclusive stakeholder-based review of potential policies and initiatives that
will reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions from a broad range of sources and activities.
The commissioner shall engage a nationally recognized independent expert entity to conduct
the stakeholder process. The report of the stakeholder process must form the basis for the plan
submitted by the commissioner under subdivision 2.
   Subd. 4. General elements of the plan. The plan must:
   (1) estimate 1990 and 2005 greenhouse gas emissions in the state and make projections of
emissions in 2015, 2025, and 2050;
    (2) identify, evaluate, and integrate a broad range of statewide greenhouse gas reduction options
for all emission sectors in the state;
   (3) assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of implementing the options; and
    (4) recommend an integrated set of reduction options and strategies for implementing the options
that will achieve the goal in subdivision 1 and interim goals recommended under subdivision 5,
including analysis of the associated costs and benefits to Minnesotans.
    Subd. 5. Specific plan requirements. (a) The plan must evaluate and recommend interim goals
as steps to achieve the goal in subdivision 1. At a minimum, the plan must evaluate and recommend
the efficacy of reducing statewide greenhouse gas emissions to a level at least 15 percent below
2005 emission levels by 2015 and to a level at least 30 percent below 2005 emission levels by 2025.
    (b) The plan must determine the feasibility, assess the costs and benefits, and recommend how
the state could adopt a regulatory system that imposes a cap on the aggregate air pollutant emissions
of a group of sources, requires those subject to the cap to own an allowance for each ton of the air
pollutant emitted, and allows for market-based trading of those allowances. The evaluation must
contain an analysis of the state implementing a cap and trade system alone, in coordination with
other states, and as a requirement of federal law applying to all states. The plan must recommend
the parameters of a cap and trade system that includes a cap that would prevent significant increases
in greenhouse gas emissions above current levels with a schedule for lowering the cap periodically
to achieve the goal in subdivision 1 and interim goals recommended under paragraph (a). The plan
48TH DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007                                      2087

must consider cost savings and cost increases on energy consumers in the state.
    (c) The plan must include recommendations for improvements in the emissions inventory and
recommend whether the state should require greenhouse gas emissions reporting from specific
sources and, if so, which sources should be required to report. The plan must also evaluate options
for an emissions registry after reviewing registries in other states and recommend a registry that
will insure the greatest opportunity for Minnesota entities to obtain marketable credits.
    Subd. 6. Regional activities. The state must, with other states in the Midwest region, develop
and implement a regional approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from activities in
the region, including consulting on a regional cap and trade system. The commissioner of
commerce shall coordinate Minnesota's regional activities under this subdivision and report to the
legislative committees in the senate and house of representatives with jurisdiction over energy
and environmental policy by February 1, 2008, and February 1, 2009, on the progress made and
recommendations for further action. The commissioner of commerce, as part of the activities
required under this subdivision, must meet with responsible officials from bordering states, other
states in the Midwest region, and states in other regions of the country to: (1) determine whether
other states are interested in establishing and cooperating in a multistate or regional greenhouse
gas cap and trade allowance program; (2) identify and prepare an inventory of greenhouse gas
reduction resources available to support a multistate or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade
allowance program; (3) seek cooperation on a regional inventory of greenhouse gas emission
sources; and (4) prepare an inventory of available renewable energy resources within a state or
region. The commissioner of commerce must develop a definition of scope of this regional activity
that is in addition to the components described in clauses (1) to (4). The commissioner must report
on the additional scoping definitions to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative
committees with jurisdiction over energy and environmental finance and policy on or before the
commencement of the 2008 regular legislative session."

possession of any kind of these liquors, in any quantity, upon the person or upon the premises leased
or occupied by any person within these limits is a public nuisance and is prima facie evidence of the
purpose of the person to barter, give away, or sell the liquor. Any person who violates this section
is guilty of a misdemeanor.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 37.21, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, the State Agricultural Society may
authorize, under terms and conditions it chooses, the sale, possession, and consumption of
intoxicating liquors at special events taking place on the fairgrounds at times other than during the
annual fair including, but not limited to, family reunions, class reunions, weddings, conventions,
and similar events. This section does not authorize the society to issue retail licenses for the sale of
alcoholic beverages. Notwithstanding subdivision 1, the State Agricultural Society may also sell
intoxicating malt liquors during the annual fair or at other times of their choosing, provided that at
least one Minnesota brewed malt liquor is made available for sale at each allowed location within
the grounds.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 340A.301, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Interest in other business. (a) Except as provided in this subdivision, a holder of a
license as a manufacturer, brewer, importer, or wholesaler may not have any ownership, in whole
or in part, in a business holding a retail intoxicating liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor license. The
commissioner may not issue a license under this section to a manufacturer, brewer, importer, or
wholesaler if a retailer of intoxicating liquor has a direct or indirect interest in the manufacturer,
brewer, importer, or wholesaler. A manufacturer or wholesaler of intoxicating liquor may use or
have property rented for retail intoxicating liquor sales only if the manufacturer or wholesaler has
owned the property continuously since November 1, 1933. A retailer of intoxicating liquor may not
use or have property rented for the manufacture or wholesaling of intoxicating liquor.
    (b) A brewer licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d), may be issued an on-sale intoxicating
liquor or 3.2 percent malt liquor license by a municipality for a restaurant operated in the place
of manufacture. Notwithstanding section 340A.405, a brewer who holds an on-sale license issued
pursuant to this paragraph or a brewer who manufactures fewer than 3,500 barrels of malt liquor
in a year may, with the approval of the commissioner, be issued a license by a municipality for
off-sale of malt liquor produced and packaged on the licensed premises. Off-sale of malt liquor
shall be limited to the legal hours for off-sale at exclusive liquor stores in the jurisdiction in which
the brewer is located, and the malt liquor sold off-sale must be removed from the premises before
the applicable off-sale closing time at exclusive liquor stores. The malt liquor shall be packaged in
64-ounce containers commonly known as "growlers.        ­" or in 750 milliliter bottles. The containers or
bottles shall bear a twist-type closure, cork, stopper, or plug. At the time of the sale, a paper or plastic
adhesive band, strip, or sleeve shall be applied to the container or bottle and extend over the top of
the twist-type closure, cork, stopper, or plug forming a seal that must be broken upon opening of the
container or bottle. The adhesive band, strip, or sleeve shall bear the name and address of the brewer.
The containers or bottles shall be identified as malt liquor, contain the name of the malt liquor, bear
the name and address of the brewer selling the malt liquor, and shall be considered intoxicating
liquor unless the alcoholic content is labeled as otherwise in accordance with the provisions of
Minnesota Rules, part 7515.1100. A brewer's total retail sales at on- or off-sale under this paragraph
48TH DAY]                                MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007                                                 2089

may not exceed 3,500 barrels per year, provided that off-sales may not total more than 500 barrels. A
brewer licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d), may hold or have an interest in other retail on-sale
licenses, but may not have an ownership interest in whole or in part, or be an officer, director, agent,
or employee of, any other manufacturer, brewer, importer, or wholesaler, or be an affiliate thereof
whether the affiliation is corporate or by management, direction, or control. Notwithstanding this
prohibition, a brewer licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d), may be an affiliate or subsidiary
company of a brewer licensed in Minnesota or elsewhere if that brewer's only manufacture of malt
liquor is:
    (i) manufacture licensed under subdivision 6, clause (d);
   (ii) manufacture in another state for consumption exclusively in a restaurant located in the place
of manufacture; or
    (iii) manufacture in another state for consumption primarily in a restaurant located in or
immediately adjacent to the place of manufacture if the brewer was licensed under subdivision 6,
clause (d), on January 1, 1995.
   (c) Except as provided in subdivision 7a, no brewer as defined in subdivision 7a or importer
may have any interest, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, in the license, business, assets, or
corporate stock of a licensed malt liquor wholesaler.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 340A.315, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. On-sale licenses allowed. Nothing in this section or in any other section of law prevents
a farm winery from obtaining a separate on-sale license and operating a business establishment
that utilizes that license, in conjunction with and within the physical facilities of the winery and its
buildings.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 340A.404, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. State-owned recreation; entertainment facilities. Notwithstanding any other law,
local ordinance, or charter provision, the commissioner may issue on-sale intoxicating liquor
licenses:

Notwithstanding section 13.591, subdivision 3, or any other law or rule to the contrary, bids are not
required to be opened and read in public if the commissioner publishes the public data specified
by section 13.591, subdivision 3, on a state Web site immediately after the deadline for receipt of
bids has passed. Bids for federal-aid highway projects must be conducted in accordance with Code
of Federal Regulations, title 23, section 635. Trunk highway construction contracts, including
design-build contracts, must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, taking into consideration
conformity with the specifications, the purpose for which the contract or purchase is intended,
the status and capability of the vendor, and other considerations imposed in the call for bids. The
commissioner may decide which is the lowest responsible bidder for all contracts and may use the
principles of life-cycle costing, when appropriate, in determining the lowest overall bid. Any or all
bids may be rejected. When competitive bids are required and all bids are rejected, new bids, if
solicited, must be called for as in the first instance, unless otherwise provided by law.

of agreements, by which a private contractor agrees with the commissioner of transportation to
provide work, supplies, or materials:
       (1) that is incidental to the construction or improvement of trunk highways; or
       (2) for maintenance of trunk highways.
A privatization transportation contract does not include a design-build contract as defined in section
161.3410, subdivision 3, and does not include services by persons licensed under section 326.02 or
326.15.
   Subd. 2. Applicability. This section applies to privatization transportation contracts in a total
amount of $25,000 or more. The requirements imposed by this section are in addition to, and do not
supersede, the requirements of any other applicable section of law.
   Subd. 3. Review of contract costs. (a) Before entering into a privatization transportation
contract, the commissioner of transportation shall prepare a comprehensive written estimate of the
cost of having the same work, supplies, or materials provided in the most cost-effective manner
by agency employees. The cost estimate must include all direct costs of having agency employees
provide the work, supplies, or materials, including the cost of pension, insurance, and other
employee benefits.
    (b) After soliciting and receiving responses, the commissioner shall publicly designate the
responder to which it proposes to award the privatization contract. The commissioner shall prepare
a comprehensive written estimate of the cost of the proposal based on the designated responder's
bid, including the cost of a transition from public to private provision of the work, any additional
unemployment and retirement benefits resulting from the transfer, and costs associated with
monitoring the proposed contract. If the designated responder proposes to perform any or all of
the desired services outside the state, the commissioner of transportation shall include in the cost
estimate, as nearly as possible, any loss of sales and income tax revenue to the state. The cost
estimate must not include trade secret data which is classified as nonpublic data under section
13.37, subdivision 2.
   (c) Before entering into a privatization transportation contact for $250,000 or more, the
commissioner shall determine that:
       (1) the cost estimated under paragraph (b) will be lower than the cost estimated under paragraph
(a);
    (2) the quality of the work, supplies, or materials to be provided by the designated responder
is likely to equal or exceed the quality of services that could be provided by Department of
Transportation employees; and
       (3) the proposed privatization contract is in the public interest.
    Subd. 4. Reports. The commissioner shall provide, no later than September 1, an annual
written report to the legislature, in compliance with sections 3.195 and 3.197, and shall submit the
report to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees having jurisdiction over
transportation. The report must list all privatization transportation contracts within the meaning of
this section that were executed or performed, whether wholly or in part, in the previous fiscal year.
The report must identify, with respect to each contract, the contractor; contract amount; duration;

work, supplies, or materials provided or to be provided; the comprehensive estimate derived under
subdivision 3, paragraph (a); the comprehensive estimate derived under subdivision 3, paragraph
(b); the actual cost to the agency of the contractor's performance of the contract; and for contracts
of at least $250,000 a statement containing the commissioner's determinations under subdivision
3, paragraph (c).

    Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 165.03, is amended to read:
    165.03 STRENGTH OF BRIDGE; INSPECTION.
    Subdivision 1. Standards generally. Each bridge, including a privately owned bridge, must
conform to the strength, width, clearance, and safety standards imposed by the commissioner for the
connecting highway or street. This subdivision applies to a bridge that is constructed after August
1, 1989, on any public highway or street. The bridge must have sufficient strength to support with
safety the maximum vehicle weights allowed under sections 169.822 to 169.829 and must have the
minimum width specified in section 165.04, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 1a. Inspection. (a) Each bridge must be inspected annually, unless a longer interval not
to exceed two years for bridges or four years for bridges classified as culverts is authorized by
the commissioner. The commissioner's authorization must be based on factors including, but not

limited to, the age and condition of the bridge, the rate of deterioration of the bridge, the type of
structure, the susceptibility of the bridge to failure, and the characteristics of traffic on the bridge.
Interim inspections at intervals of less than one year may be necessary on bridges that are posted,
bridges subjected to extreme scour conditions, bridges subject to significant substructure movement
or settlement, and for other reasons as specified or inferred in the AASHTO manual.
    (b) The thoroughness of each inspection depends on such factors as age, traffic characteristics,
state of maintenance, and known deficiencies. The evaluation of these factors is the responsibility
of the engineer assigned the responsibility for inspection as defined by rule adopted by the
commissioner of transportation.
    Subd. 2. Inspection and inventory responsibilities; rules; forms. (a) The commissioner of
transportation shall adopt official inventory and bridge inspection report forms for use in making
bridge inspections by the owners or highway authorities specified by this subdivision. B      ­­r­d

A person shall immediately apply for a salvage certificate of title if the person acquires a damaged
late-model or high-value motor vehicle with an out-of-state title and the vehicle:
     (1) is a vehicle that was acquired by an insurer through payment of damages;
     (2) is a vehicle for which the cost of repairs exceeds the value of the damaged vehicle; or
     (3) has an out-of-state salvage certificate of title as proof of ownership.
    (c) A self-insured owner of a late-model or high-value vehicle who sustains damage by collision
or other occurrence which exceeds 70 percent of its actual cash value shall immediately apply for a
salvage certificate of title. Damage, for the purpose of this calculation, does not include the actual
cost incurred to repair, replace, or reinstall inflatable safety restraints and other vehicle components
that must be replaced due to the deployment of the inflatable safety restraints.

    Subd. 2. Towing order required. A towing authority may not tow a motor vehicle from
public property unless a peace officer or parking enforcement officer has prepared, in addition
to the parking citation, a written towing report describing the motor vehicle and the reasons for
towing. The report must be signed by the officer and the tow driver. Within the Department of
Transportation's eight-county metropolitan district, an authorized employee of the department's
freeway service patrol may order a tow from a trunk highway after preparing a written towing
report provided by the Minnesota State Patrol. A citation need not be issued before the employee
orders a tow. The department employee shall ensure that the tower initially requested to remove the

vehicle is given the opportunity, to the greatest reasonable extent, to actually conduct and complete
all towing operations requested, provided that the owner of the vehicle to be towed has not already
requested that another tower remove the vehicle, in which case the tower contacted by the owner
must be given the first reasonable opportunity to conduct the towing operations required.
     Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Traffic-control signal. (a) Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals
exhibiting different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in
combination, only the colors Green, Red, and Yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian
signals carrying a word or legend. The traffic-control signal lights or colored lighted arrows
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
     (1) Green indication:
     (i) Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed straight through or turn right or
left unless a sign at such place prohibits either turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or adjacent crosswalk at the time this signal is exhibited.
    (ii) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another
indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow,
or other movement as permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic
lawfully using the intersection.
    (iii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed
across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. Every driver of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to such pedestrian, except that the pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the green signal indication is first shown.
     (2) Steady yellow indication:
    (i) Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that
the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately
thereafter when vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection, except for the continued movement
allowed by any green arrow indication simultaneously exhibited.
    (ii) Pedestrians facing a circular yellow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
signal as provided in subdivision 6, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.

before entering the intersection and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except
as follows: (A) the driver of a vehicle stopped as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk
on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection in obedience
to a red or stop signal, and with the intention of making a right turn may make the right turn, after
stopping, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting such movement, but shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that
intersection; or (B) the driver of a vehicle on a one-way street intersecting another one-way street
on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red or stop signal and may then make a
left turn into the one-way street, unless an official sign has been erected prohibiting the movement,
but shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by
the signal at that intersection.
   (ii) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in subdivision 6,
pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (iii) Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal, with the intention of making a movement
indicated by the arrow, must stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection and
must remain standing until a permissive signal indication permitting the movement indicated by the
red arrow is displayed, except as follows: when an official sign has been erected permitting a turn
on a red arrow signal, the vehicular traffic facing a red arrow signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street on which
traffic moves to the left, after stopping, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other
traffic lawfully proceeding as directed by the signal at that intersection.
    (b) In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except those which can have no application.
Any stop required must be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
must be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop must be made at the signal.
    (c) When a traffic-control signal indication or indications placed to control a certain movement
or lane are so identified by placing a sign near the indication or indications, no other traffic-control
signal indication or indications within the intersection controls vehicular traffic for that movement
or lane.

     (b) A child passenger restraint system is not required for a child who cannot, in the judgment of
a licensed physician, be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system because of a medical
condition, body size, or physical disability. A motor vehicle operator claiming exemption for a child
under this paragraph must possess a typewritten statement from the physician stating that the child
cannot be safely transported in a child passenger restraint system. The statement must give the name
and birth date of the child, be dated within the previous six months, and be made on the physician's
letterhead or contain the physician's name, address, and telephone number. A person charged with
violating subdivision 5 may not be convicted if the person produces the physician's statement in
court or in the office of the arresting officer.
    (c) A person offering a motor vehicle for rent or lease shall provide a child passenger restraint
device to a customer renting or leasing the motor vehicle who requests the device. A reasonable rent
or fee may be charged for use of the child passenger restraint device.

    (f) The commissioner, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, may suspend a certificate
issued under paragraph (b) for failure to meet annual certification requirements prescribed by
the commissioner or failure to inspect commercial motor vehicles in accordance with inspection
procedures established by the State Patrol. The commissioner shall revoke a certificate issued
under paragraph (b) if the commissioner determines after notice and an opportunity for a hearing
that the certified person issued an inspection decal for a commercial motor vehicle when the person
knew or reasonably should have known that the vehicle was in such a state of repair that it would
have been declared out of service if inspected by an employee of the State Patrol. Suspension and
revocation of certificates under this subdivision are not subject to sections 14.57 to 14.69.

include:
   (1) the full name of the person performing the inspection, and the person's inspector certification
number;
   (2) the name of the owner of the vehicle and, if applicable, the United States Department of
Transportation carrier number issued to the owner of the vehicle, or to the operator of the vehicle if

regulations; and
   (6) the inspector's certification that the inspection was complete, accurate, and in compliance
with the requirements of this section.
    (b) The owner must retain a copy of the inspection report for at least 14 months at a location in
the state where the vehicle is domiciled or maintained. The inspector must maintain a copy of the
inspection report for a period of 14 months following the inspection in a location in the state where
the inspector conducts business. During this period the report must be available for inspection by
an authorized federal, state, or local official.
    (c) The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the inspection report and revise it as necessary
to comply with state and federal law and regulations. The adoption of the report form is not subject
to the Administrative Procedure Act.

      Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.782, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Driver; daily inspection report. (a) The driver of a commercial motor vehicle
shall report in writing at the completion of each day's work on each commercial motor vehicle
the driver has operated. A person who owns one or more commercial motor vehicles and who
employs drivers for those commercial motor vehicles must require each driver to submit a written
report as required ­n
                   i­ by this section. The report must cover the following parts and accessories:
service brakes, including trailer and semitrailer brake connections; parking (hand) brake; steering
mechanism; lighting devices and reflectors; tires; horn; windshield wiper or wipers; rear vision
mirror or mirrors; coupling devices; wheels and rims; and emergency equipment.
    (b) The report must identify the vehicle and list any defect or deficiency discovered by or reported
to the driver that would affect the safe operation of the vehicle or result in its mechanical breakdown.
If no defect or deficiency is discovered by or reported to the driver, the report must so indicate. The
driver must sign the report after completing it. In the case of a commercial motor vehicle operated by
two drivers, the signature of one of the drivers satisfies the requirements of this subdivision if both
drivers agree concerning the defects or deficiencies. If a driver operates more than one commercial
motor vehicle during a day's work, a report must be prepared for each vehicle operated.
      (c) Before operating or allowing the operation of a commercial motor vehicle on which a report

    (b) Statewide, no semitrailer may exceed 48 feet in overall length, including bumper and
load, but excluding non-cargo-carrying equipment, such as refrigeration units or air compressors,
necessary for safe and efficient operation and located on the end of the semitrailer adjacent to the
truck-tractor. However, statewide, a single semitrailer may exceed 48 feet, but not 53 feet, if the
distance from the kingpin to the centerline of the rear axle group of the semitrailer does not exceed
43 feet.
    (c) Statewide, no single trailer may have an overall length exceeding 45 feet, including the tow
bar assembly but exclusive of rear bumpers that do not increase the overall length by more than six
inches.
   (d) For determining compliance with this subdivision, the length of the semitrailer or trailer must
be determined separately from the overall length of the combination of vehicles.
   (e) No semitrailer or trailer used in a three-vehicle combination may have an overall length in
excess of 28-1/2 feet, exclusive of:
    (1) non-cargo-carrying accessory equipment, including refrigeration units or air compressors and
upper coupler plates, necessary for safe and efficient operation, located on the end of the semitrailer
or trailer adjacent to the truck or truck-tractor;
   (2) the tow bar assembly; and
   (3) lower coupler equipment that is a fixed part of the rear end of the first semitrailer or trailer.

weight on any single wheel shall not exceed 10,000 pounds unless posted;
    (2) where the gross weight on any single axle exceeds 18,000 pounds, except that on paved
county state-aid highways, paved county roads, designated local routes, and state trunk highways
the gross weight on any single axle shall not exceed 20,000 pounds unless posted;
   (3) where the maximum wheel load:
  (i) on the foremost and rearmost steering axles, exceeds 600 pounds per inch of tire width or the
manufacturer's recommended load, whichever is less; or
   (ii) on other axles, exceeds 500 pounds per inch of tire width or the manufacturer's recommended
load, whichever is less. This item applies to new vehicles manufactured after August 1, 1991. For
vehicles manufactured before August 2, 1991, the maximum weight per inch of tire width is 600
pounds per inch or the manufacturer's recommended load, whichever is less, until August 1, 1996.
After July 31, 1996, this item applies to all vehicles regardless of date of manufacture;

   Sec. 78. [219.015] STATE RAIL SAFETY INSPECTOR.
     (a) The commissioner of transportation shall establish two positions of state rail safety inspector
in the Office of Freight and Commercial Vehicle Operations of the Minnesota Department of
Transportation. The commissioner shall apply to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of
the United States Department of Transportation to participate in the Federal State Rail Safety
Partnership Program for training and certification of two inspectors under authority of United
States Code, title 49, sections 20103, 20105, 20106, and 20113, and Code of Federal Regulations,
title 49, part 212. The state rail safety inspectors shall inspect mainline, secondary yard track and
industry track; inspect railroad right-of-way, including adjacent or intersecting drainage, culverts,
bridges, overhead structures, and traffic and other public crossings; inspect yards and physical
plants; review and enforce safety requirements; review maintenance and repair records; and review
railroad security measures. To the extent delegated by the commissioner, the inspectors may issue
citations for violations of this chapter, or to ensure railroad employee and public safety and welfare.
    (b) The commissioner shall annually assess railroad companies that are (1) defined as common
carriers under section 218.011, (2) classified by federal law or regulation as Class I Railroads or
Class I Rail Carriers, and (3) operating in this state by a divisor of equal proportion between carriers
in equal amounts for 365 days of the calendar year. The commissioner shall assess all start-up
or re-establishment costs, and all related costs of initiating the state rail safety inspector program
beginning July 1, 2007. The state rail inspector duties must begin and be assessed on January 1, 2008.
The assessments must be deposited in a special account in the special revenue fund, to be known as
the state rail safety inspection account. Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner
and may be expended to cover the costs incurred for the establishment and ongoing responsibilities
of the state rail safety inspector.
    (c) The commissioner may exempt a common carrier not federally classified as Class I from
violations for a period of up to two years if the common carrier applies for participation in a work
site safety coaching program, such as the "MNSharp" program administered by the Minnesota
Department of Labor and Industry, and the commissioner determines such participation to be
preferred enforcement for safety or security violations.
    (d) Any person aggrieved by an assessment levied under this section may appeal within 90 days
any assessment, violation, or administrative penalty to the Office of Administrative Hearings, with
further appeal and review by the district court.
   Sec. 79. [219.373] WALKWAYS BY TRACK.
   Subdivision 1. General standards. (a) Consistent with section 219.50, every railroad company
shall provide a walkway alongside track that has a regular surface that is smooth and safe for use

by railroad employees and other persons who have duties in proximity to trains. The walkway
must be kept reasonably free of hazards and obstructions, including, but not limited to, debris,
litter, fuel, oil, sand, boulders, posts, tie materials, holes, ruts, potholes, grains, grain products or
byproducts, fertilizer products, chemical, chemical molten, steel, tin, metallic products, solid raw
minerals, palletized products, silica products, materials spilled during revenue shipment, detached
pieces or parts of railroad rolling stock or track structure, and vegetation.
   (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) or otherwise exempted by other law, a
walkway alongside track that is required under this section must be constructed and maintained in
conformity to the standards in this section.
   (c) A walkway alongside track that is required pursuant to this section must:
   (1) provide a reasonably regular surface that is smooth and safe for use by railroad employees
and other persons who have duties in proximity to trains;
    (2) be surfaced with crushed material, asphaltic concrete, planking, or other material that does
not compromise track drainage;
   (3) unless the grade of the track is greater than one inch in eight inches, have a grade that is less
than one inch in eight inches;
   (4) if the walkway is alongside track with a curve greater than 18 degrees, be not less than one
foot wider than otherwise required; and
   (5) be kept reasonably free of hazards and obstructions in paragraph (a).
   (d) Except as provided otherwise in this section, walkways located along main-line tracks
and tracks where switching is regularly performed more than twice in a seven-day period
must be surfaced with crushed material not to exceed American Railway Engineering and
Maintenance-of-Way Association (AREMA) standard number 4, 1-1/2 inches in size, or with
asphalt, concrete, planking, grating, or similar material.
    (e) Walkways located along switching lead tracks, switches in yards, car spotting areas, and
railroad shop or repair tracks must be surfaced with crushed material not to exceed AREMA standard
number 5, three-fourths to one inch in size, or with asphalt, concrete, planking, grating, or similar
material.
    (f) This section is temporarily suspended during periods of heavy rain or snow, derailments,
rocks and earth slides, and similar abnormal periods and for a reasonable time thereafter to permit
restoration work.
    (g) Compliance with this section is not a defense to any civil action brought for the violation of
a railroad safety law, regulation, rule, or order.
    (h) The commissioner, after investigation, upon the commissioner's own motion, or upon the
petition of the aggrieved person, may determine that the safety of railroad employees requires
implementation of the applicable standards set forth in paragraphs (b) to (f), for any walkway.
   Subd. 2. Liability. Nothing in this section precludes or preempts civil liability to an injured party
under state or federal laws for failure to provide a reasonable safe walkway.

    d­) (e) The limitations prescribed in this section do not apply to the manufacturer or supplier of
any equipment or machinery installed upon real property.
   Subd. 2. Action allowed; limitation. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), in the case of ­
                              an
                               ­ a cause of action which accrues during the ninth or tenth year after
substantial completion of the construction, an action to recover damages may be brought within
two years after the date on which the cause of action accrued, but in no event may such an action
be brought more than 12 years after substantial completion of the construction. Nothing in this
subdivision shall limit the time for bringing an action for contribution or indemnity.
   Subd. 3. Not construed. Nothing in this section shall be construed as extending the period
prescribed by the laws of this state for the bringing of any action.
    Subd. 4. Applicability. For the purposes of actions based on breach of the statutory warranties set
forth in section 327A.02, or to actions based on breach of an express written warranty, such actions
shall be brought within two years of the discovery of the breach. In the case of an action under
section 327A.05, which accrues during the ninth or tenth year after the warranty date, as defined in
section 327A.01, subdivision 8, an action may be brought within two years of the discovery of the
breach, but in no event may an action under section 327A.05 be brought more than 12 years after
the effective warranty date. An action for contribution or indemnity related to actions described in
this subdivision may be brought no later than two years after the cause of action for contribution or
indemnity has accrued, based upon the time of accrual provided in subdivision 1, paragraph (c).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
all actions pending on or commenced on or after that date.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.175, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Order directing sale of real property. The executing creditor must obtain an
order from the court directing a sale of the real property that includes a homestead before service
of the notice of execution on real property containing the homestead of the debtor. The order shall
contain the following findings:
   (1) whether the real property is the homestead of a nondebtor;
   (2) the amount of the debtor's homestead exemption, if any; and
   (3) whether the fair market value of the real property exceeds the sum of the debtor's homestead
exemption and the present encumbrances.
    If the court finds that there is no nondebtor with a valid homestead interest in the real property and
that the fair market value of the homestead real property exceeds the sum of the debtor's homestead
exemption and the present encumbrances, the court shall order a sale of the real property for cash
or cash equivalents to the extent of the homestead exemption.
    Subd. 1a. Notification of homestead designation. If real property is to be sold on execution
and the property contains a portion of the homestead of the debtor, the debtor must be notified by
the executing creditor that the homestead may be sold and redeemed separately from the remaining
property. The notice in subdivision 2 must be included in the notice of execution served on the
debtor under section 550.19.

    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.175, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Sale of property. (a) If the sheriff receives a homestead property designation under
subdivision 3, the sheriff must offer and sell the designated homestead property, and the remaining
property, separately, unless the executing creditor denies the right to the exemption, objects to the
property designated, or claims the value exceeds the exemption.
    (b) If the executing creditor is dissatisfied with the homestead property designation or the debtor's
valuation of the property, upon proper motion to the district court of the county in which any part
of the property is located, the executing creditor is entitled to a court approved designation of the
homestead and a court determination of value. The court shall either approve the debtor's designation
or cause the property to be surveyed and order a homestead designation consistent with the standards
of subdivision 3 and require an appraisal of fair market value, as applicable. The court's designation
of the homestead property must conform to the debtor's request, to the extent not inconsistent with
the standards of subdivision 3.
   (c) The court, in determining appraised value, shall review any appraisals provided by the debtor
and executing creditor and may require a court appointed independent appraisal. The appraisals shall
evaluate the property's fair market value, net of reasonable costs of sale.
    (d) If the court determines that the property claimed as a homestead exceeds in value the
amount of the homestead exemption or if the court determines that the property cannot be divided
without material injury, the court shall order the sale of the entire property, including the designated
homestead.  ­­

or cash equivalents to the extent of the homestead exemption.
    (e) At the sale, no bid may be accepted unless it exceeds the amount of the homestead exemption.
If no bid exceeds the exemption, the homestead is exempt.
    (f) The cost of any court ordered survey or appraisal and of the sale must be collected on the
execution, if the debtor designated as the debtor's homestead a greater quantity of property, property
of greater value than the debtor was entitled to, or designated a parcel that does not meet the standards
of subdivision 3. In all other cases, the costs shall be borne by the executing creditor.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.175, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Real property not subject to execution. Real property that includes a homestead as
defined under section 510.01 is not subject to execution under this chapter if there is a nondebtor
with:
    (1) homestead rights under sections 507.02 and 510.01 to 510.04;
    (2) rights as a joint tenant or life tenant; or
    (3) rights to take the homestead under section 524.2-402.
    Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.18, is amended to read:
    550.18 NOTICE OF SALE.
    Before the sale of property on execution notice shall be given as follows:
48TH DAY]                                          MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007                                                                2167

    (1) if the sale be of personal property, by giving ten days posted notice of the time and place
thereof;
    (2) if the sale be of real property, on execution or on judgment, by six weeks posted and published
notice of the time and place thereof, describing the property with sufficient certainty to enable a
person of common understanding to identify it.
    (3) A judgment creditor shall record a certified copy of the order directing sale of real property
issued pursuant to section 550.175, if the real property is a homestead, with the county recorder or
registrar of titles as appropriate in the county in which the real property is located before the first
date of publication of the notice of sale required under section 550.18, clause (2).
    An officer who sells without such notice shall forfeit $100 to the party aggrieved, in addition to
paying actual damages; and a person who before the sale or the satisfaction of the execution, and
without the consent of the parties, takes down or defaces the notice posted, shall forfeit $50; but
the validity of the sale shall not be affected by either act, either as to third persons or parties to the
action.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.19, is amended to read:
     550.19 SERVICE ON JUDGMENT DEBTOR.

must, at least four weeks before the appointed time of sale, serve a copy of the notice of sale in like
manner as a summons in a civil action in the district court upon the judgment debtor if the judgment
debtor is a resident of the county and upon any person in possession of the homestead other than
the judgment debtor. In addition, the notice of sale must also be served upon all persons who have
recorded a request for notice in accordance with section 580.032.
  Sec. 10. [550.206] REPORT OF SALE OF HOMESTEAD ON EXECUTION;
CONFIRMATION; RESALE.
    Upon sale of a homestead on execution, the sheriff shall file a report of the sale with the court.
Upon the filing of the report of sale, the court shall grant an order confirming the sale, or, if it appears
upon due examination that justice has not been done, the court may order a resale on terms the court
determines are just. Upon confirmation of the sale and execution of the certificate of sale, the sheriff
shall hold the amount of the homestead exemption in trust for the judgment debtor until the debtor
vacates the property, or the redemption period expires, whichever occurs first. The balance of the
proceeds of the sale shall be applied to the execution. The sheriff shall pay any surplus thereafter in
the manner provided in section 580.09.
     Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.22, is amended to read:
     550.22 CERTIFICATE OF SALE OF REALTY.
    When a sale of real property is made upon execution, or pursuant to a judgment or order of
a court, unless otherwise specified therein, the officer shall execute and deliver to the purchaser a
certificate containing:

   (1) a description of the execution, judgment, or order;
   (2) a description of the property;
   (3) the date of the sale and the name of the purchaser;
   (4) the price paid for each parcel separately;
   (5) if subject to redemption, the time allowed by law therefor;
   (6) the amount of the debtor's homestead exemption, if any, as determined under section 550.175.
     Such certificate shall be executed, acknowledged, and recorded in the manner provided by law
for a conveyance of real property, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts ­h

expiration of the time for redemption, shall operate as a conveyance to the purchaser of all the right,
title, and interest of the person whose property is sold in and to the same, at the date of the lien upon
which the same was sold. Any person desiring to perpetuate evidence that any real property sold
under this section was not homestead real property may procure an affidavit by the person enforcing
the judgment, or that person's attorney, or someone having knowledge of the facts, setting forth that
the real property was not homestead real property. The affidavit shall be recorded by the county
recorder or registrar of titles, and the affidavit and certified copies of the affidavit shall be prima
facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 550.24, is amended to read:
   550.24 REDEMPTION OF REALTY.
    (a) Upon the sale of real property, if the estate sold is less than a leasehold of two years' unexpired
term, the sale is absolute. In all other cases the property sold, or any portion thereof which has been
sold separately, is subject to redemption as provided in this section.
    (b) The judgment debtor, the debtor's heirs, successors, legal representatives, or assigns may
redeem within one year after the day of sale, or order confirming sale if the property is a homestead,
by paying, to the purchaser or the officer making the sale, the amount for which the property was
sold with interest at the judgment rate and if the purchaser is a creditor having a prior lien, the
amount thereof, with interest at the judgment rate together with any costs as provided in sections
582.03 and 582.031.
    (c) If there is no redemption during the debtor's redemption period, creditors having a lien, legal
or equitable, on the property or some part thereof, subsequent to that on which it was sold may
redeem in the manner provided for redemption by creditors of the mortgagor in section 580.24, in
the order of their respective liens.
    (d) If the property is abandoned during the judgment debtor's redemption period, the person
holding the sheriff's certificate may request that the court reduce the judgment debtor's redemption
period to five weeks using the procedures provided for a foreclosure by action in section 582.032,
subdivision 5.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.24, is amended to read:
   580.24 REDEMPTION BY CREDITOR.
48TH DAY]                           MONDAY, APRIL 16, 2007                                         2169

    (a) If no redemption is made by the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal representatives or
assigns, the most senior creditor having a legal or equitable lien upon the mortgaged premises,
or some part of it, subsequent to the foreclosed mortgage, may redeem within seven days after
the expiration of the redemption period determined under section 580.23 or 582.032, whichever is
applicable; and each subsequent creditor having a lien may redeem, in the order of priority of their
respective liens, within seven days after the time allowed the prior lienholder by paying the amount
required under this section. However, no creditor is entitled to redeem unless, within the period
allowed for redemption by the mortgagor, the creditor:
   (1) records with each county recorder and registrar of titles where the foreclosed mortgage is
recorded a notice of the creditor's intention to redeem;
    (2) records in each office where the notice is recorded all documents necessary to create the lien
on the mortgaged premises and to evidence the creditor's ownership of the lien; and
    (3) after complying with clauses (1) and (2), delivers to the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure
sale or the sheriff's successor in office a copy of each of the documents required to be recorded under
clauses (1) and (2), with the office, date and time of filing for record stated on the first page of each
document.
    The sheriff shall maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff and shall
note the date of delivery on each document. The sheriff may charge a fee of $100 for the documents
delivered to the sheriff relating to each lien. The sheriff shall maintain copies of documents delivered
to the sheriff for a period of six months after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
    (b) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and the first day following the expiration of the prior
redemption period must be included in computing the seven-day redemption period. When the
last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, that day must be omitted from
the computation. The order of redemption by judgment creditors subsequent to the foreclosed
mortgage shall be determined by the order in which their judgments were entered as memorials
on the certificate of title for the foreclosed premises or docketed in the office of the district
court administrator if the property is not registered under chapter 508 or 508A, regardless of the
homestead status of the property. All mechanic's lienholders who have coordinate liens shall have
one combined seven-day period to redeem.
    (c) The amount required to redeem from the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale is the amount
required under section 580.23. The amount required to redeem from a person holding a certificate
of redemption is:
   (1) the amount paid to redeem as shown on the certificate of redemption; plus
   (2) interest on that amount to the date of redemption; plus
    (3) the amount claimed due on the person's lien, as shown on the affidavit under section 580.25,
clause (3).
    The amount required to redeem may be paid to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale or
the certificate of redemption, as the case may be, or to the sheriff for the holder."
   Amend the title accordingly
