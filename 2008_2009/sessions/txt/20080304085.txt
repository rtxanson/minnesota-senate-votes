    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009, for enrollees for whom federal
funding is not available, and is effective January 1, 2009, or upon federal approval, whichever is
later, for enrollees for whom federal funding is available.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.04, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Families with children. (a) Families with children with family income equal to

             ­7­5
                ­ 300 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size shall
be eligible for MinnesotaCare according to this section. All other provisions of sections 256L.01 to
256L.18, including the insurance-related barriers to enrollment under section 256L.07, shall apply
unless otherwise specified.
    (b) Parents who enroll in the MinnesotaCare program must also enroll their children, if the
children are eligible. Children may be enrolled separately without enrollment by parents. However,
if one parent in the household enrolls, both parents must enroll, unless other insurance is available. If
one child from a family is enrolled, all children must be enrolled, unless other insurance is available.
If one spouse in a household enrolls, the other spouse in the household must also enroll, unless other
insurance is available. Families cannot choose to enroll only certain uninsured members.
   (c) Beginning October 1, 2003, the dependent sibling definition no longer applies to the
MinnesotaCare program. These persons are no longer counted in the parental household and may
apply as a separate household.

is approved.
   (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The premium for the new period of eligibility must be received as
provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
    (c) For single adults and households with no children formerly enrolled in general assistance
medical care and enrolled in MinnesotaCare according to section 256D.03, subdivision 3, the first

standard and meets all other eligibility requirements, including compliance at the time of application
with citizenship or nationality documentation requirements under section 256L.04, subdivision 10,
shall be determined eligible beginning in the month of application. The applicant must provide all
required verifications within 60 days' notice of the eligibility determination or eligibility shall be
terminated. Applicants who are terminated for failure to provide all required verifications are not
eligible to apply for coverage using the delayed verification procedures specified in this subdivision
for 12 months.

for MinnesotaCare.
    (b) The commissioner shall develop and implement procedures to: (1) require enrollees to report
changes in income; (2) adjust sliding scale premium payments, based upon both increases and
decreases in enrollee income, at the time the change in income is reported; and (3) disenroll enrollees
from MinnesotaCare for failure to pay required premiums. Failure to pay includes payment with
a dishonored check, a returned automatic bank withdrawal, or a refused credit card or debit card
payment. The commissioner may demand a guaranteed form of payment, including a cashier's check
or a money order, as the only means to replace a dishonored, returned, or refused payment.

    (c) Premiums are calculated on a calendar month basis and may be paid on a monthly, quarterly,
or semiannual basis, with the first payment due upon notice from the commissioner of the premium
amount required. The commissioner shall inform applicants and enrollees of these premium payment
options. Premium payment is required before enrollment is complete and to maintain eligibility
in MinnesotaCare. Premium payments received before noon are credited the same day. Premium
payments received after noon are credited on the next working day.
      (d) Nonpayment of the premium will result in disenrollment from the plan effective ­                                   fo­­r the
first day of the calendar month following the calendar month for which the premium was due.
Persons disenrolled for nonpayment or who voluntarily terminate coverage from the program may
not reenroll until four calendar months have elapsed. P                ­­

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later, except that the effective date for the amendment to paragraph (a) related to
the expansion in eligibility to 300 percent of federal poverty guidelines is contingent on meeting
the cost containment goals established in section 62U.14 and having sufficient funding for the
expansion.

             l Children enrolled in the original children's health plan and children in families with
income equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, who have other health
insurance, are eligible if the coverage:
     (1) lacks two or more of the following:
     (i) basic hospital insurance;
     (ii) medical-surgical insurance;
     (iii) prescription drug coverage;
     (iv) dental coverage; or
     (v) vision coverage;
     (2) requires a deductible of $100 or more per person per year; or
   (3) lacks coverage because the child has exceeded the maximum coverage for a particular
diagnosis or the policy excludes a particular diagnosis.
    The commissioner may change this eligibility criterion for sliding scale premiums in order to
remain within the limits of available appropriations. The requirement of no health coverage does
not apply to newborns.

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. Until December 31, 2008, the sliding fee scale begins with a
premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families
with incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in
effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1,
1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family
size of five. The sliding fee scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five.
The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.
    (b) F­­
          am­ ­l­e
              i­i­­s Children whose gross income is above ­  27
                                                              ­5­ 300 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge for
one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum premium,
the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and administration.
In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of the total. The costs
of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and the enrollees in these
groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two enrollees shall be twice the
maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or more enrollees shall be three
times the maximum premium for one.
    (c) Beginning January 1, 2009, MinnesotaCare enrollees shall pay premiums according to the
affordability scale established in section 62U.15, subdivision 2, with the exception that children in
families with income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines shall pay a monthly

the purchase of employee health insurance in the private market. The commissioner shall collect
necessary actuarial data, employment data, current coverage data, and other needed information.
   (b) The commissioner shall develop cost estimates for three levels of insurance coverage for
long-term care workers:
   (1) the coverage provided to state employees;
   (2) the coverage provided to MinnesotaCare enrollees; and
   (3) the benefits provided under an "average" private market insurance product, but with a
deductible limited to $100 per person.
    Premium cost sharing, waiting periods for eligibility, definitions of full- and part-time
employment, and other parameters under the three options must be identical to those under the

    The commissioner may recommend a different definition of long-term care worker if this
definition presents insurmountable implementation issues.
   (d) The recommendations must include measures to:
   (1) ensure equitable treatment between employers that currently have different levels of
expenditure for employee health insurance costs; and
   (2) enforce the requirement that the rate increase be expended for the intended purpose.

    Subd. 3. Premium rate restrictions. No individual health plan may be offered, sold, issued, or

the following requirements:
    (a) Except for policies issued under section 62U.03, subdivision 5, paragraph (b), premium rates
must be no more than 25 percent above and no more than 25 percent below the index rate charged
to individuals for the same or similar coverage, adjusted pro rata for rating periods of less than one
year. The premium variations permitted by this paragraph must be based only upon health status,
claims experience, and occupation. For purposes of this paragraph, health status includes refraining
from tobacco use or other actuarially valid lifestyle factors associated with good health, provided
that the lifestyle factor and its effect upon premium rates have been determined by the commissioner
to be actuarially valid and have been approved by the commissioner. Variations permitted under this
paragraph must not be based upon age or applied differently at different ages. This paragraph does
not prohibit use of a constant percentage adjustment for factors permitted to be used under this
paragraph.
    (b) Premium rates may vary based upon the ages of covered persons only as provided in this
paragraph. In addition to the variation permitted under paragraph (a), each health carrier may use
an additional premium variation based upon age of up to plus or minus 50 percent of the index rate.

   (2) each geographic region must be composed of no fewer than seven counties that create a
contiguous region; and
    (3) the health carrier provides actuarial justification acceptable to the commissioner for the
proposed geographic variations in index rates, establishing that the variations are based upon
differences in the cost to the health carrier of providing coverage.
   (d) Health carriers may use rate cells and must file with the commissioner the rate cells they use.
6868                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [85TH DAY

Rate cells must be based upon the number of adults or children covered under the policy and may
reflect the availability of Medicare coverage. The rates for different rate cells must not in any way
reflect generalized differences in expected costs between principal insureds and their spouses.
   (e) In developing its index rates and premiums for a health plan, a health carrier shall take into
account only the following factors:
   (1) actuarially valid differences in rating factors permitted under paragraphs (a) and (b); and
   (2) actuarially valid geographic variations if approved by the commissioner as provided in
paragraph (c).
   (f) All premium variations must be justified in initial rate filings and upon request of
the commissioner in rate revision filings. All rate variations are subject to approval by the
commissioner.
   (g) The loss ratio must comply with the section 62A.021 requirements for individual health
plans.
    (h) The rates must not be approved, unless the commissioner has determined that the rates are
reasonable. In determining reasonableness, the commissioner shall consider the growth rates applied
under section 62J.04, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), to the calendar year or years that the proposed
premium rate would be in effect, actuarially valid changes in risks associated with the enrollee
populations, and actuarially valid changes as a result of statutory changes in Laws 1992, chapter
549.
     (i) An insurer may, as part of a minimum lifetime loss ratio guarantee filing under section
62A.02, subdivision 3a, include a rating practices guarantee as provided in this paragraph. The
rating practices guarantee must be in writing and must guarantee that the policy form will be
offered, sold, issued, and renewed only with premium rates and premium rating practices that
comply with subdivisions 2, 3, 4, and 5. The rating practices guarantee must be accompanied by an
actuarial memorandum that demonstrates that the premium rates and premium rating system used
in connection with the policy form will satisfy the guarantee. The guarantee must guarantee refunds
of any excess premiums to policyholders charged premiums that exceed those permitted under
subdivision 2, 3, 4, or 5. An insurer that complies with this paragraph in connection with a policy
form is exempt from the requirement of prior approval by the commissioner under paragraphs (c),
(f), and (h).

    Subd. 2. Exceptions. (a) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual conversion policies
to eligible employees otherwise eligible for conversion coverage under section 62D.104 as a result
of leaving a health maintenance organization's service area.
   (b) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual conversion policies to eligible employees
otherwise eligible for conversion coverage as a result of the expiration of any continuation of group
coverage required under sections 62A.146, 62A.17, 62A.21, 62C.142, 62D.101, and 62D.105.
  (c) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew conversion policies under section 62E.16 to eligible
employees.
  (d) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual continuation policies to eligible
employees as required.
    (e) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew individual health plans if the coverage is appropriate
due to an unexpired preexisting condition limitation or exclusion applicable to the person under the
employer's group health plan or due to the person's need for health care services not covered under
the employer's group health plan.
    (f) A health carrier may sell, issue, or renew an individual health plan, if the individual has
elected to buy the individual health plan not as part of a general plan to substitute individual health
plans for a group health plan nor as a result of any violation of subdivision 3 or 4.

    (g) Nothing in this subdivision relieves a health carrier of any obligation to provide continuation
or conversion coverage otherwise required under federal or state law.
   (h) Nothing in this chapter restricts the offer, sale, issuance, or renewal of coverage issued as a
supplement to Medicare under sections 62A.3099 to 62A.44, or policies or contracts that supplement
Medicare issued by health maintenance organizations, or those contracts governed by sections 1833,
1851 to 1859, 1860D, or 1876 of the federal Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section
1395 et seq., as amended.
   (i) Nothing in this chapter restricts the offer, sale, issuance, or renewal of individual health plans
necessary to comply with a court order.
    (j) A health carrier may offer, issue, sell, or renew an individual health plan to persons eligible
for an employer group health plan, if the individual health plan is a high deductible health plan for
use in connection with an existing health savings account, in compliance with the Internal Revenue
Code, section 223. In that situation, the same or a different health carrier may offer, issue, sell, or
renew a group health plan to cover the other eligible employees in the group.
    (k) A health carrier may offer, sell, issue, or renew an individual health plan to one or more
employees of a small employer if the individual health plan is marketed directly to employees or
through the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section 62U.02 to all employees of the
small employer and the small employer does not contribute directly or indirectly to the premiums
or facilitate the administration of the individual health plan. Except as provided in section 62U.03,
subdivision 5, paragraph (b), the requirement to market an individual health plan to all employees
does not require the health carrier to offer or issue an individual health plan to any employee. For
purposes of this paragraph, an employer is not contributing to the premiums or facilitating the
administration of the individual health plan if the employer does not contribute to the premium and
merely collects the premiums from an employee's wages or salary through payroll deductions and
submits payment for the premiums of one or more employees in a lump sum to the health carrier
or to the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section 62U.02. Except for coverage under
section 62A.65, subdivision 5, paragraph (b), or 62E.16, at the request of an employee, the health
carrier or the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section 62U.02 may bill the employer
for the premiums payable by the employee, provided that the employer is not liable for payment
except from payroll deductions for that purpose. If an employer is submitting payments under this
paragraph, the health carrier or the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange, as applicable, shall
provide a cancellation notice directly to the primary insured at least ten days prior to termination
of coverage for nonpayment of premium. Individual coverage under this paragraph may be offered
only if the small employer has not provided coverage under section 62L.03 to the employees within
the past 12 months.
    The employer must provide a written and signed statement to the health carrier or the Minnesota
Health Insurance Exchange, as applicable, stating that the employer is not contributing directly or
indirectly to the employee's premiums. The Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange under section
62U.02 shall provide all health carriers with enrolled employees of the employer with a copy of the
employer's statement. The health carrier may rely on the employer's statement and is not required
to guarantee-issue individual health plans to the employer's ­

  (1) refrain from filing an application for health coverage when other similarly situated employees
may file an application for health coverage;
   (2) file an application for health coverage during initial eligibility for coverage, the acceptance of
which is contingent on health status, when other similarly situated employees may apply for health
coverage, the acceptance of which is not contingent on health status;
    (3) seek coverage from another health carrier, including, but not limited to, MCHA; or
   (4) cause coverage to be issued on different terms because of the health status or claims
experience of that person or the person's dependents.
    Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62Q.735, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

contract, a health plan company shall give to the provider a complete copy of the proposed contract,
including:
    (1) all attachments and exhibits;
    (2) operating manuals;
   (3) a general description of the health plan company's health service coding guidelines and
requirement for procedures and diagnoses with modifiers, and multiple procedures; and
    (4) all guidelines and treatment parameters incorporated or referenced in the contract.
