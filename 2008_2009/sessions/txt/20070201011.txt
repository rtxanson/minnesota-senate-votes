                                        7. BUDGET RESOLUTION
   7.1 The Committees on Taxes and on Finance must hold hearings as necessary to determine state
revenues and appropriations for the fiscal biennium.
    7.2 Within 30 days after the last state general fund revenue and expenditure forecast for the
next fiscal biennium becomes available during the regular session in the odd-numbered year, and
after receiving from the Committee on Taxes a resolution containing its recommendation on the
maximum limit on revenues and an amount to be set aside as a budget reserve and a cash flow
account, the Committee on Finance must adopt and report to the Senate a budget resolution, in the
form of a Senate resolution. The budget resolution must set: (1) the maximum limit on revenues and
net appropriations for the next fiscal biennium for the general fund; and (2) an amount or amounts
to be set aside as a budget reserve and a cash flow account. The budget resolution must not specify,
limit, or prescribe revenues or appropriations by any category other than those specified in clauses
(1) and (2). If the Committee on Finance recommends a maximum limit on revenues or an amount for
the budget reserve or cash flow account that differs from the amount recommended by the Committee
on Taxes, the recommendation of the Committee on Finance must be referred to the Committee on
Rules and Administration before it may be considered by the Senate.
    7.3 After the Senate adopts the budget resolution, the limits in the resolution are effective during
the regular session in the year in which the resolution is adopted, unless the Senate, acting upon a
subsequent report of the Committee on Taxes as to revenues or of the Committee on Finance as to
appropriations, adopts a different limit or limits for the same fiscal biennium. During the regular
session in the even-numbered year, before the Committee on Finance reports a bill containing net
appropriations in excess of the general fund appropriations in the current fiscal biennium estimated
by the most recent state budget forecast, the Committee must adopt a budget resolution that accounts
for the net appropriations. After the Committee adopts the budget resolution, it is effective during
the regular session that year, unless the Committee adopts a different or amended resolution.
    7.4 Within 14 days after the Senate or the Committee on Finance adopts a budget resolution,
the Committee must adopt, by resolution, limits for each major appropriation bill identified in this
Rule. After the Committee adopts the resolution, the limits in the resolution are effective during the
regular session in the year in which the resolution is adopted, unless the Committee subsequently
adopts different or amended limits for the same fiscal biennium. If the Committee on Finance or the
Senate combines two or more major appropriation bills into one bill, the limits in the Committee
resolution pertaining to those bills are also combined, and the sum of the combined limits applies
to the combined bill.
   7.5 The major tax and appropriation bills are:
   (1) the omnibus tax bill;

   A major appropriation or tax bill may not be divided.
    7.6 After the adoption of a resolution by the Senate or by the Committee on Finance, the
Committee on Finance and the Committee on Taxes must reconcile each bill recommended by the
committee with the resolution or resolutions. When reporting a bill, the committee must certify
to the Senate that the committee has reconciled the fiscal effect of the bill with the resolution or
resolutions and that the bill, as reported by the committee, together with other bills reported and
expected to be reported by the committee, does not and will not exceed the limits specified in
either resolution.
    7.7 After the adoption of a resolution by the Senate or the Committee on Finance, an amendment
to a bill is out of order if it would cause any of the limits specified in either resolution to be exceeded.
Whether an amendment is out of order under this Rule is a question to be decided in the Senate by
the President and in committee by the committee chair. In making the determination, the presiding
officer may consider:
   (1) the limits in a resolution;
   (2) the effect of existing laws on revenues and appropriations;
   (3) the effect of amendments previously adopted to the bill under consideration;
    (4) the effect of bills previously recommended by a committee or bills previously passed in the
legislative session by the Senate or by the Legislature;
    (5) whether appropriation increases or revenue decreases that would result from the amendment
are offset by decreases in other appropriations or increases in other revenue specified by the
amendment; and
   (6) other information reasonably related to appropriation and revenue amounts.

                                        8. CONFIRMATIONS
   8.1 Every gubernatorial appointment requiring the advice and consent of the Senate must
be referred by the President to the appropriate committee. If a question arises as to the proper
committee, the appointment must be referred without debate to the Committee on Rules and
Administration for a report making the proper reference.

committee. Nothing prohibits a member of the minority group from serving as chair or vice chair

a complaint that members have violated the open meeting requirements of Minnesota Statutes,

bulletin boards in the Capitol and the State Office Building. A notice must be sent to the House of

Rules and Administration.

otherwise the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of correspondence, books,
papers, and documents, in the manner provided by Minnesota Statutes, section 3.153.

to members, and shall also decide all questions of order, subject to an appeal to the Senate by a
member.
    14.4 An appeal is decided by a majority vote of those present and voting. Upon an appeal from
the decision of the President, the question is, "Shall the decision of the President be the judgment
of the Senate?"
   14.5 The President shall sign all acts, memorials, addresses and resolutions. All writs, warrants,
and subpoenas issued by the Senate must be signed by the President and attested by the Secretary.
    14.6 Upon a finding by the Committee on Rules and Administration that the President refuses or
is unable to sign any of the documents described in this rule, the Chair of the Committee on Rules

   25.3 The Consent Calendar must be electronically available or printed at least one calendar day
before the matters on it are considered.
    25.4 If a member objects to consideration of a bill on the Consent Calendar at any time during its
consideration in the Senate before the question on final passage is put, and that objection is supported
by at least two other members, the bill is referred to the Committee of the Whole, and the Secretary
shall place it at the bottom of General Orders subject to Rule 22.2, except that it need not lie over
one calendar day before consideration in the Committee of the Whole.

                                      26. SPECIAL ORDERS

   26.4 As nearly as applicable, debate on the bill and all proceedings including amendments and
substitutions must be conducted as in the Committee of the Whole.
   26.5 On any question, a member may request a roll call vote, which must be entered in the
Journal.
   26.6 Unless it is otherwise disposed of, after consideration a bill on Special Orders must
immediately proceed to its third reading and final passage.

occasions to take the bill up after it was designated a special order.

                                           27. MOTIONS
    27.1 A motion or amendment must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
or committee offering it.
   27.2 When a motion is made, it must be stated by the President. If it is in writing, it must be
handed to the Secretary and read to the members.
   27.3 After a motion is stated by the President, or read by the Secretary, it is in possession of the
Senate, but may be withdrawn by the author at any time before decision or amendment.

                               28. PRECEDENCE OF MOTIONS
   28.1 When a question is under debate no motion may be made, except:
        1. To adjourn.
        2. To recess.
        3. To reconsider.
        4. To lay on the table.

          7. To postpone to a day certain.
          8. To amend.
          9. To postpone indefinitely.
   28.2 Motions numbered 1, 2, 4 and 5 above are not debatable.
   28.3 These motions have precedence in the foregoing order; but when a motion for the previous
question has been made, or the main question ordered, a motion to lay on the table is not in order.
   28.4 A motion to postpone to a day certain, to refer, to postpone indefinitely, or to amend, having
been decided, may not again be put on the same day, nor at the same stage of the bill or proposition.

                                   29. MOTION TO ADJOURN
    A motion to adjourn or a motion to adjourn to a time certain is always in order. The latter motion
is debatable solely as to the time. When either motion is rejected, it may not be renewed until further
business has been transacted.

                                30. MOTION TO RECONSIDER
    30.1 When a motion or question has been decided, a member who voted with the prevailing side
may move for reconsideration on the same day on which the vote was taken or within the next two
calendar days or, if later, the first day the Senate meets after the vote was taken. The motion takes
precedence over all other questions except a motion to adjourn or recess. When a motion to adjourn
is adopted before the disposition of the motion for reconsideration, a motion for reconsideration
must lie over until the next succeeding day the Senate meets except as provided in this rule.
    30.2 When notice of intent to move reconsideration of the final action of the Senate on a question
is given by a member, the Secretary shall retain the subject of the notice until after the expiration of
the time during which the motion can be made.
    30.3 A notice of intent to move for reconsideration is not in order after the Tuesday before the
third Saturday in May, but a motion to reconsider may be made.
   30.4 A motion for reconsideration having been once voted on may not be made again nor
reconsidered.

                       31. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION
   31.1 Unless a motion for the previous question is made specifically applicable to a subsidiary
motion, it must be in this form: "Shall the main question now be put?" If the motion for the previous
question is supported by a majority of the members present, its effect is to put an end to all debate
and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon all pending amendments in their order and then upon the
main question.
   31.2 On a motion for the previous question, a call of the Senate is in order before the President
submits the question to the Senate.
    31.3 On a motion for the previous question there is no debate. All incidental questions of order,
arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and pending the motion, must be decided,
whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate.

     A bill or resolution may be referred to committee at any time before its passage. If an amendment
is reported on the referral to any committee other than the Committee of the Whole, it must again be
read the second time, considered in Committee of the Whole, read the third time and placed on final
passage. If the referral is to the Committee of the Whole it must be placed at the head of General
Orders, except when the referral is from the Consent Calendar under Rule 25.4.

                      33. MOTION TO AMEND BILL OR RESOLUTION
    33.1 A motion to amend must be written if a member requests. It must identify the member
offering it.

of the bill, then to the page, and then to the line or lines where language is to be stricken or inserted.
    33.3 In filling blanks, the largest sum, the longest time and the greatest distance must be first
taken.
   33.4 The title to a bill may be amended by the Secretary at any time the bill is amended by the
Senate.

unanimous consent of the Senate unless it fills a blank, amends the title, is proposed to the chief
author of the bill by the Revisor of Statutes to correct technical defects found by the Revisor while
engrossing earlier amendments to the bill, or is proposed to a bill on the Consent Calendar before
the bill is given its third reading.

                               34. MOTION TO SUSPEND RULES
   34.1 A rule may be suspended by a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole Senate.

is intended to accomplish a substantially different purpose, than that of the original bill to which it
is proposed.
    35.3 An amendment to insert a constitutional amendment is not germane to a bill that does not
already include a constitutional amendment.
   35.4 Whether an amendment is germane is to be decided by the President, who may put the
question to the body if the President chooses.
    35.5 A motion to remove an amendment placed on a House bill under Rule 45.1 is out of order
if removal of the amendment would make a portion of the House bill not germane to the Senate
178                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [11TH DAY

classification, profession, or occupation, shall disclose the potential conflict of interest by following

term or during a special session held after that time that a lobbyist has violated Rule 58.1 or 58.2.
The investigatory procedures of Rule 55 apply, except as provided in this rule. The complaint and
proceedings on the complaint are private until the subcommittee has found probable cause to believe
that a violation of Rule 58.1 or 58.2 has occurred, unless they are made public by the lobbyist whose
conduct is the subject of the complaint or by the vote of at least three members of the subcommittee.
