   Subd. 5. Appointing authorities to recommend certain salaries. (a) The governor, or
other appropriate appointing authority, may submit to the Legislative Coordinating Commission
recommendations for salaries within the salary limits for the positions listed in subdivisions 2 to 4.
An appointing authority may also propose additions or deletions of positions from those listed.
   (b) Before submitting the recommendations, the appointing authority shall consult with the
commissioner of employee relations concerning the recommendations.
    (c) In making recommendations, the appointing authority shall consider the criteria established
in section 43A.18, subdivision 8, and the performance of individual incumbents. The performance
evaluation must include a review of an incumbent's progress toward attainment of affirmative action

goals. The appointing authority shall establish an objective system for quantifying knowledge,
abilities, duties, responsibilities, and accountabilities, and in determining recommendations, rate
each position by this system.
    (d) Before the appointing authority's recommended salaries take effect, the recommendations
must be reviewed and approved, rejected, or modified by the Legislative Coordinating Commission
and the legislature under section 3.855, subdivisions 2 and 3. If, when the legislature is not in session,
the commission fails to reject or modify salary recommendations of the governor within 30 calendar
days of their receipt, the recommendations are deemed to be approved.
    (e) The appointing authority shall set the initial salary of a head of a new agency or a chair of
a new metropolitan board or commission whose salary is not specifically prescribed by law after
consultation with the commissioner, whose recommendation is advisory only. The amount of the
new salary must be comparable to the salary of an agency head or commission chair having similar
duties and responsibilities.

with the commissioner. If the appointing authority increases a salary under this paragraph, the
appointing authority shall submit the new salary to the Legislative Coordinating Commission and
the full legislature for approval, modification, or rejection under section 3.855, subdivisions 2
and 3. If, when the legislature is not in session, the commission fails to reject or modify salary
recommendations of the governor within 30 calendar days of their receipt, the recommendations

establish equitable compensation relationships between female-dominated, male-dominated, and
balanced classes of employees in the executive branch. Compensation relationships are equitable
within the meaning of this subdivision when the primary consideration in negotiating, establishing,
recommending, and approving total compensation is comparability of the value of the work in
relationship to other positions in the executive branch. A recognized system for classification
analysis and its concurrent point allocation system must be used in order to attain compensation
equity. Classification range maximums must fall within the system's point allocation window.
Market-driven forces are recognized as acceptable in order to maintain employee recruitment
and retention efforts whenever the compensation rates exceed the allocated points. No contract
executed under chapter 179A may modify, waive, or abridge this section and sections 43A.07 to
43A.121, 43A.15, and 43A.17 to 43A.21, except to the extent expressly permitted in those sections.
Any compensation equity adjustments must be made from agency appropriations. Fifty percent of
the compensation governed by this system must be adjusted in fiscal year 2009 and the remaining
compensation in fiscal year 2010.

in this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, "political subdivision of this state" includes a
statutory or home rule charter city, county, town, metropolitan or regional agency, or other political
subdivision, but does not include a hospital, clinic, or health maintenance organization owned by
such a governmental unit.
    (b) Beginning in 2006, the limit in paragraph (a) shall be adjusted annually in January. The
limit shall equal the limit for the prior year increased by the percentage increase, if any, in the
Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second prior year to October of
the immediately prior year.
    (c) Deferred compensation and payroll allocations to purchase an individual annuity contract
for an employee are included in determining the employee's salary. Other forms of compensation
which shall be included to determine an employee's total compensation are all other direct and
indirect items of compensation which are not specifically excluded by this subdivision. Other forms
of compensation which shall not be included in a determination of an employee's total compensation
for the purposes of this subdivision are:
    (1) employee benefits that are also provided for the majority of all other full-time employees of
the political subdivision, vacation and sick leave allowances, health and dental insurance, disability
insurance, term life insurance, and pension benefits or like benefits the cost of which is borne by the
employee or which is not subject to tax as income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
   (2) dues paid to organizations that are of a civic, professional, educational, or governmental
nature; and
    (3) reimbursement for actual expenses incurred by the employee which the governing body
determines to be directly related to the performance of job responsibilities, including any relocation
expenses paid during the initial year of employment.
    The value of other forms of compensation shall be the annual cost to the political subdivision
for the provision of the compensation.
    (d) The salary of a medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy occupying a position that the governing
body of the political subdivision has determined requires an M.D. or D.O. degree is excluded from
the limitation in this subdivision.
    (e) The commissioner may increase the limitation in this subdivision for a position that the
commissioner has determined requires special expertise necessitating a higher salary to attract
or retain a qualified person. The commissioner shall review each proposed increase giving due
consideration to salary rates paid to other persons with similar responsibilities in the state and
nation. The commissioner may not increase the limitation until the commissioner has presented
the proposed increase to the Legislative Coordinating Commission and received the commission's
recommendation on it. The recommendation is advisory only. If the commission does not give
its recommendation on a proposed increase within 30 days from its receipt of the proposal, the
commission is deemed to have made no recommendation. If the commissioner grants or granted
an increase under this paragraph, the new limitation shall be adjusted beginning in August 2005
and in each subsequent calendar year in January by the percentage increase equal to the percentage
increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers from October of the second
prior year to October of the immediately prior year.

administrator must have at least five years of experience working as a power systems engineer
or transmission planner, or in a position dealing with power system reliability issues, and may
not have been a party or a participant in a commission energy proceeding for at least one year
prior to selection by the commissioner. The commissioner shall oversee and direct the work of the
administrator, annually review the expenses of the administrator, and annually approve the budget
of the administrator. The administrator may hire staff and may contract for technical expertise in
performing duties when existing state resources are required for other state responsibilities or when
special expertise is required. The salary of the administrator is governed by section 15A.0815,     ­

the costs among all energy utilities in proportion to their respective gross operating revenues from
sales of gas or electric service within the state during the last calendar year, and shall then render a
bill to each utility on a regular basis; and
    (2) costs relating to a specific proceeding analysis or project and shall render a bill to the specific
energy utility or utilities participating in the proceeding, analysis, or project directly, either at the
conclusion of a particular proceeding, analysis, or project, or from time to time during the course of
the proceeding, analysis, or project.
    (d) For purposes of administrative efficiency, the department shall assess energy utilities and
issue bills in accordance with the billing and assessment procedures provided in section 216B.62,
to the extent that these procedures do not conflict with this subdivision. The amount of the bills
rendered by the department under paragraph (c) must be paid by the energy utility into an account
in the special revenue fund in the state treasury within 30 days from the date of billing and is
appropriated to the department for the purposes provided in this section. The commission shall
approve or approve as modified a rate schedule providing for the automatic adjustment of charges
to recover amounts paid by utilities under this section. All amounts assessed under this section are
in addition to amounts appropriated to the commission and the department by other law.

computing and telecommunications hardware and software, the activities undertaken to secure that
hardware and software, and the activities undertaken to acquire, transport, process, analyze, store,
and disseminate information electronically. "Information and telecommunications technology
systems and services" includes all proposed expenditures for computing and telecommunications
hardware and software, security for that hardware and software, and related consulting or other
professional services.
   (b) "Information and telecommunications technology project" means an effort to acquire or
produce information and telecommunications technology systems and services.
   (c) "Telecommunications" means voice, video, and data electronic transmissions transported by

Universities unless specifically provided elsewhere in this chapter.
   (f) "Total expected project cost" includes direct staff costs, all supplemental contract staff and
vendor costs, and costs of hardware and software development or purchase. Breaking a project into
several phases does not affect the cost threshold, which must be computed on the full cost of all
aspects of the related subprojects.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16E.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Responsibilities. (a) In addition to other activities prescribed by law, the office shall
carry out the duties set out in this subdivision.
    (b) The office shall develop and establish a state information architecture to ensure that state
agency development and purchase of information and communications systems, equipment, and
services is designed to ensure that individual agency information systems complement and do not
needlessly duplicate or conflict with the systems of other agencies. When state agencies have need
for the same or similar public data, the chief information officer, in coordination with the affected
agencies, shall manage the most efficient and cost-effective method of producing and storing data
for or sharing data between those agencies. The development of this information architecture must
include the establishment of standards and guidelines to be followed by state agencies. The office
shall ensure compliance with the architecture.

    (c) The office shall assist state agencies in the planning and management of information
systems so that an individual information system reflects and supports the state agency's mission
and the state's requirements and functions. The office shall review and approve agency technology
plans to ensure consistency with enterprise information and telecommunications technology
strategy. By January 15 of each year, the chief information officer must report to the chairs and the
ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction over the
office regarding the assistance provided under this paragraph. The report must include a listing of
agencies that have developed or are developing plans under this paragraph.
   (d) The office shall review and approve agency requests for funding for the development or
purchase of information systems equipment or software before the requests may be included in the
governor's budget.
   (e) The office shall review major purchases of information systems equipment to:
   (1) ensure that the equipment follows the standards and guidelines of the state information
architecture;
   (2) ensure the agency's proposed purchase reflects a cost-effective policy regarding volume
purchasing; and
    (3) ensure that the equipment is consistent with other systems in other state agencies so that
data can be shared among agencies, unless the office determines that the agency purchasing the
equipment has special needs justifying the inconsistency.
    (f) The office shall review the operation of information systems by state agencies and ensure
that these systems are operated efficiently and securely and continually meet the standards and
guidelines established by the office. The standards and guidelines must emphasize uniformity
that is cost-effective for the enterprise, that encourages information interchange, open systems
environments, and portability of information whenever practicable and consistent with an agency's
authority and chapter 13.
    (g) The office shall conduct a comprehensive review at least every three years of the information
systems investments that have been made by state agencies and higher education institutions. The
review must include recommendations on any information systems applications that could be
