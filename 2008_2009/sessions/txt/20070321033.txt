  Page 98, line 14, before the period, insert "or that all members are restricted to obtaining

   Page 119, after line 5, insert:
                                            "ARTICLE 7
                              LUMBER COMPANY EMPLOYEES
   Section 1. LUMBER COMPANY EXTRA BENEFITS.
   Subdivision 1. Extra benefits; availability. Extra unemployment benefits are available to an
applicant if the applicant was laid off due to lack of work after April 1, 2006, from the Ainsworth
Lumber Company plants in Bemidji, Cook, and Grand Rapids, and established a benefit account
under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.07, prior to March 1, 2007.
    Subd. 2. Payment from fund; effect on employer. Extra unemployment benefits are payable
from the unemployment insurance trust fund. Extra unemployment benefits paid under this
section will not be used in computing the experience rating of Ainsworth Lumber Company under
Minnesota Statutes, section 268.047.
   Subd. 3. Eligibility conditions. An applicant is eligible to receive extra unemployment benefits
under this section for any week through December 31, 2007, following the effective date of the
applicant's benefit account of regular unemployment benefits, as a result of a layoff described under
subdivision 1, if:
   (1) a majority of the applicant's wage credits were with Ainsworth Lumber Company or
Ainsworth Engineered;
   (2) the applicant meets the eligibility requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 268.085;
   (3) the applicant is not subject to a disqualification under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.095;
    (4) the applicant is not entitled to regular unemployment benefits and the applicant is not entitled
to receive unemployment benefits under any other state or federal law for that week; and
    (5) the applicant is enrolled in, or has within the last two weeks successfully completed, a
program that qualifies as reemployment assistance training under Minnesota Statutes, section
268.035, subdivision 21a, except that an applicant whose training is scheduled to begin in more
than 30 days may be considered to be in training if: (i) the applicant's chosen training program does
not offer an available start date within 30 days; (ii) the applicant is scheduled to begin training on
the earliest available start date for the chosen training program; and (iii) the applicant is scheduled
to begin training in no more than 60 days.
    Subd. 4. Weekly amount of extra benefits. The weekly extra unemployment benefits amount
available to an applicant is the same as the applicant's weekly regular unemployment benefit amount
on the benefit account established as a result of a layoff under subdivision 1.
   Subd. 5. Maximum amount of extra unemployment benefits. (a) The maximum amount
of extra unemployment benefits available is equal to 13 weeks at the applicant's weekly extra
1054                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [33RD DAY

unemployment benefits amount.
    (b) If an applicant qualifies for a new regular benefit account under Minnesota Statutes,
section 268.07, at any time after exhausting regular unemployment benefits as a result of the
layoff under subdivision 1, the applicant must apply for and exhaust entitlement to those new
regular unemployment benefits. The maximum amount of extra unemployment benefits available
is reduced by any new regular unemployment benefits available if the majority of wage credits on
that new regular benefit account were with Ainsworth Lumber Company or Ainsworth Engineered.
   (c) The maximum amount of extra unemployment benefits available is reduced by any severance
pay, pay in lieu of notice, or any similar pay paid by Ainsworth Lumber Company or Ainsworth
Engineered to the applicant after May 1, 2006. The reduction is done as follows:
   (1) the number of weeks of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice, or any similar pay is computed
under Minnesota Statutes, section 268.085, subdivision 3, paragraph (b); and
   (2) each week of severance pay, pay in lieu of notice, or similar pay, reduces a week of extra
unemployment benefits available.
   This paragraph does not apply to payments required under the federal Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 United States Code, Section 2101, et seq.
    Subd. 6. Program expiration. This extra unemployment benefit program expires on December
31, 2007. No extra unemployment benefits may be paid for any week after the expiration of this
program.
    Subd. 7. Findings. The legislature finds that providing extra unemployment benefits to assist
laid-off workers of Ainsworth Lumber Company, while in training, is appropriate because:
   (1) the unemployment rate in the applicant's county of employment is higher than the statewide
average rate of unemployment;
    (2) the average weekly wages paid in the applicant's county of employment is below the
statewide average weekly wage;
   (3) the applicant's weekly wage is higher than the statewide average weekly wage; and
    (4) the dislocated worker program has determined that the applicant does not currently possess
skills making reemployment in a comparable position likely.
   Sec. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Section 1 is effective the first Sunday following final enactment."

   Page 1, line 4, after the second semicolon, insert "extending certain unemployment benefits;"
   And when so amended the bill do pass. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A or nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the
provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply to the school except as provided in this section. A
nonprofit corporation or cooperative that has operated a charter school successfully for a minimum
of six years may apply to operate up to two additional charter schools that replicate the original
school under the same nonprofit corporation or cooperative. Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and
465.719, a school district may create a corporation for the purpose of creating a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may form and operate a school, the sponsor must file an affidavit with the
commissioner stating its intent to authorize a charter school. The affidavit must state the terms and
conditions under which the sponsor would authorize a charter school and how the sponsor intends
to oversee the fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the terms of
the written contract between the sponsor and the charter school board of directors under subdivision
6. The commissioner must approve or disapprove the sponsor's proposed authorization within ญ     90

days of receipt of the affidavit. Failure to obtain commissioner approval precludes a sponsor from
authorizing the charter school that was the subject of the affidavit.
    (c) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as a
cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish
a the first board of directors composed of at least five nonrelated members until a timely election
ญ
for members of the charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and
bylaws.
      (d) A ญ The permanent charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five
nonrelated members. A board member must be a resident of Minnesota or a bordering state.
Any staff members who are employed at the school, including teachers providing instruction
under a contract with a cooperative, and all parents of children enrolled in the school m                                                ญญ ayญ are

    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Admission requirements. A charter school may limit admission to:
    (1) pupils within an age group or grade level;
   (2) people who are eligible to participate in the graduation incentives program under section
124D.68; or
    (3) residents of a specific geographic area where the percentage of the population of
non-Caucasian people of that area is greater than the percentage of the non-Caucasian population
in the congressional district in which the geographic area is located, and as long as the school
reflects the racial and ethnic diversity of the specific area.
    A charter school shall enroll an eligible pupil who submits a timely application, unless the
number of applications exceeds the capacity of a program, class, grade level, or building. In this case,
pupils must be accepted by lot. The charter school must develop and publish the lottery process. If
a charter school is the only school located in a town serving pupils within a particular grade level,
then pupils that are residents of the town must be given preference for enrollment before accepting
pupils by lot. If a pupil lives within two miles of a charter school and the next closest public school
is more than five miles away, the charter school must give those pupils preference for enrollment
before accepting other pupils by lot.
    A charter school shall give preference for enrollment to a sibling of an enrolled pupil and to a
foster child of that pupil's parents and to children of the school's employees before accepting other
pupils by lot.
    A charter school may not limit admission to pupils on the basis of intellectual ability, measures
of achievement or aptitude, or athletic ability.

years. Any request to extend the leave shall be granted only at the discretion of the school board. The
district may require that the request for a leave or extension of leave be made up to 90 days before
the teacher would otherwise have to report for duty. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision
and except for section 122A.46, subdivision 7, the leave is governed by section 122A.46, including,

      "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Revenue amount. (a) A school district, intermediate school district, school site,
or charter school that meets the conditions of section 122A.414 and submits an application approved
by the commissioner is eligible for alternative teacher compensation revenue.
   (b) For school district and intermediate school district applications, the commissioner must
consider only those applications to participate that are submitted jointly by a district and the
exclusive representative of the teachers. The application must contain an alternative teacher
professional pay system agreement that:
      (1) implements an alternative teacher professional pay system consistent with section 122A.414;
and
    (2) is negotiated and adopted according to the Public Employment Labor Relations Act under
chapter 179A, except that notwithstanding section 179A.20, subdivision 3, a district may enter into
a contract for a term of two or four years.
    Alternative teacher compensation revenue for a qualifying school district or site in which the
school board and the exclusive representative of the teachers agree to place teachers in the district
or at the site on the alternative teacher professional pay system equals $260 times the ratio of the
formula allowance for the current fiscal year to the formula allowance for fiscal year 2007 times the
number of pupils enrolled at the district or site on October 1 of the previous fiscal year. Alternative
teacher compensation revenue for a qualifying intermediate school district must be calculated under
section 126C.10, subdivision 34, paragraphs (a) and (b).
    (c) For a newly combined or consolidated district, the revenue shall be computed using the sum
of pupils enrolled on October 1 of the previous year in the districts entering into the combination or
consolidation. The commissioner may adjust the revenue computed for a site using prior year data
to reflect changes attributable to school closings, school openings, or grade level reconfigurations
between the prior year and the current year.

   (d) The revenue is available only to school districts, intermediate school districts, school sites,
and charter schools that fully implement an alternative teacher professional pay system by October
1 of the current school year.
       EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2008.
       Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.415, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Revenue timing. (a) Districts, intermediate school districts, school sites, or charter
schools with approved applications must receive alternative compensation revenue for each school
year that the district, intermediate school district, school site, or charter school implements an
alternative teacher professional pay system under this subdivision and section 122A.414. For fiscal
year 2007 and later, a qualifying district, intermediate school district, school site, or charter school
that received alternative teacher compensation aid for the previous fiscal year must receive at least
an amount of alternative teacher compensation revenue equal to the lesser of the amount it received
for the previous fiscal year or the amount it qualifies for under subdivision 1 for the current fiscal
year if the district, intermediate school district, school site, or charter school submits a timely
application and the commissioner determines that the district, intermediate school district, school
site, or charter school continues to implement an alternative teacher professional pay system,
consistent with its application under this section.
    (b) The commissioner shall approve applications that comply with subdivision 1, and section
122A.414, subdivisions 2, paragraph (b), and 2a, if the applicant is a charter school, in the order
in which they are received, select applicants that qualify for this program, notify school districts,
intermediate school districts, school sites, and charter schools about the program, develop and
disseminate application materials, and carry out other activities needed to implement this section.

   Senator Chaudhary from the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, to which
was referred
    S.F. No. 1137: A bill for an act relating to the environment; modifying agency service
requirements; modifying wetland replacement requirements and exemptions; providing for civil
enforcement; appropriating money; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, sections 15.99, subdivision
2; 103G.222, subdivision 1; 103G.2241, subdivisions 1, 3, 7, 9, 11; 103G.2243, subdivision 2;
103G.2372, by adding a subdivision; repealing Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.2241,
subdivision 8.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 15.99, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Application; extensions. (a) The time limit in subdivision 2 begins upon the agency's
receipt of a written request containing all information required by law or by a previously adopted
rule, ordinance, or policy of the agency, including the applicable application fee. If an agency
receives a written request that does not contain all required information, the 60-day limit starts over
only if the agency sends written notice within 15 business days of receipt of the request telling the
requester what information is missing.
    (b) If a request relating to zoning, septic systems, watershed district review, soil and water
conservation district review, or expansion of the metropolitan urban service area requires the
approval of more than one state agency in the executive branch, the 60-day period in subdivision
2 begins to run for all executive branch agencies on the day a request containing all required
information is received by one state agency. The agency receiving the request must forward copies
to other state agencies whose approval is required.
   (c) An agency response meets the 60-day time limit if the agency can document that the response
was sent within 60 days of receipt of the written request.
    (d) The time limit in subdivision 2 is extended if a state statute, federal law, or court order
requires a process to occur before the agency acts on the request, and the time periods prescribed in
the state statute, federal law, or court order make it impossible to act on the request within 60 days.
In cases described in this paragraph, the deadline is extended to 60 days after completion of the
last process required in the applicable statute, law, or order. Final approval of an agency receiving
a request is not considered a process for purposes of this paragraph.
    (e) If a complete application requires a wetland delineation or verification of a delineation,
wetland replacement plan approval, or certification of determination of exemption from wetland
replacement under section 103G.2241, the deadline in subdivision 2 for an application deemed
complete under this section is extended to 60 days after the completion of the required delineation
or verification of the delineation, replacement plan approval, or certification of determination of
exemption, whichever is later.
    ญ
    (ญ
     eญ
      ) (f) The time limit in subdivision 2 is extended if: (1) a request submitted to a state agency
requires prior approval of a federal agency; or (2) an application submitted to a city, county, town,
school district, metropolitan or regional entity, or other political subdivision requires prior approval
of a state or federal agency. In cases described in this paragraph, the deadline for agency action is

extended to 60 days after the required prior approval is granted.
   ญ(ญ) (g) An agency may extend the time limit in subdivision 2 before the end of the initial 60-day
     fญ
period by providing written notice of the extension to the applicant. The notification must state the
reasons for the extension and its anticipated length, which may not exceed 60 days unless approved
by the applicant.
   ญ
   (g
    ญญ) (h) An applicant may by written notice to the agency request an extension of the time limit
under this section.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103B.101, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 12. Authority to issue penalty orders. The board may issue an order requiring violations
to be corrected and administratively assessing monetary penalties for violations of this chapter and
chapters 103C, 103D, 103E, 103F, and 103G, any rules adopted under those chapters, and any
standards, limitations, or conditions established by the board.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.222, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) Wetlands must not be drained or filled, wholly or partially,
unless replaced by restoring or creating wetland areas of at least equal public value under a
replacement plan approved as provided in section 103G.2242, a replacement plan under a local
governmental unit's comprehensive wetland protection and management plan approved by the
board under section 103G.2243, or, if a permit to mine is required under section 93.481, under
a mining reclamation plan approved by the commissioner under the permit to mine. Mining
reclamation plans shall apply the same principles and standards for replacing wetlands by
restoration or creation of wetland areas that are applicable to mitigation plans approved as provided
in section 103G.2242. Public value must be determined in accordance with section 103B.3355 or
a comprehensive wetland protection and management plan established under section 103G.2243.
Sections 103G.221 to 103G.2372 also apply to excavation in permanently and semipermanently
flooded areas of types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands.
   (b) Replacement must be guided by the following principles in descending order of priority:
   (1) avoiding the direct or indirect impact of the activity that may destroy or diminish the wetland;
   (2) minimizing the impact by limiting the degree or magnitude of the wetland activity and its
implementation;
   (3) rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected wetland
environment;
   (4) reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations
during the life of the activity;
   (5) compensating for the impact by restoring a wetland; and
   (6) compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute wetland resources or
environments.
   For a project involving the draining or filling of wetlands in an amount not exceeding 10,000
square feet more than the applicable amount in section 103G.2241, subdivision 9, paragraph (a), the

local government unit may make an on-site sequencing determination without a written alternatives
analysis from the applicant.
    (c) If a wetland is located in a cultivated field, then replacement must be accomplished through
restoration only without regard to the priority order in paragraph (b), provided that a deed restriction
is placed on the altered wetland prohibiting nonagricultural use for at least ten years.
    (d) If a wetland is drained under section 103G.2241, subdivision 2, the local government
unit may require a deed restriction that prohibits nonagricultural use for at least ten years unless
the drained wetland is replaced as provided under this section. The local government unit may
require the deed restriction if it determines the wetland area drained is at risk of conversion to a
nonagricultural use within ten years based on the zoning classification, proximity to a municipality
or full service road, or other criteria as determined by the local government unit.
   (e) Restoration and replacement of wetlands must be accomplished in accordance with the
ecology of the landscape area affected and ponds that are created primarily to fulfill stormwater
management and water quality treatment requirements may not be used to satisfy replacement
requirements under this chapter.

on nonagricultural land, replacement must be in the ratio of two acres of replaced wetland for each
acre of drained or filled wetland.

80 percent area, replacement must be in the ratio of one acre of replaced wetland for each acre of
drained or filled wetland.
   ญญญ
   (g ) (h) Wetlands that are restored or created as a result of an approved replacement plan are
subject to the provisions of this section for any subsequent drainage or filling.
    ญ
    (h
     ญญ) (i) Except in a greater than 80 percent area, only wetlands that have been restored from
previously drained or filled wetlands, wetlands created by excavation in nonwetlands, wetlands
created by dikes or dams along public or private drainage ditches, or wetlands created by dikes
or dams associated with the restoration of previously drained or filled wetlands may be used in a
statewide banking program established in rules adopted under section 103G.2242, subdivision 1.
Modification or conversion of nondegraded naturally occurring wetlands from one type to another
are not eligible for enrollment in a statewide wetlands bank.
    ญ
    (ญ)
     iญ (j) The Technical Evaluation Panel established under section 103G.2242, subdivision 2,
shall ensure that sufficient time has occurred for the wetland to develop wetland characteristics
of soils, vegetation, and hydrology before recommending that the wetland be deposited in the
statewide wetland bank. If the Technical Evaluation Panel has reason to believe that the wetland
characteristics may change substantially, the panel shall postpone its recommendation until the
wetland has stabilized.

     ญญ) (l) For projects involving draining or filling of wetlands associated with a new public
transportation project, and for projects expanded solely for additional traffic capacity, public
transportation authorities may purchase credits from the board at the cost to the board to establish

credits. Proceeds from the sale of credits provided under this paragraph are appropriated to the
board for the purposes of this paragraph.
    ญ
    (ญ)
      lญ (m) A replacement plan for wetlands is not required for individual projects that result in
the filling or draining of wetlands for the repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or replacement of a
currently serviceable existing state, city, county, or town public road necessary, as determined by the
public transportation authority, to meet state or federal design or safety standards or requirements,
excluding new roads or roads expanded solely for additional traffic capacity lanes. This paragraph
only applies to authorities for public transportation projects that:
   (1) minimize the amount of wetland filling or draining associated with the project and consider
mitigating important site-specific wetland functions on-site;
     (2) except as provided in clause (3), submit project-specific reports to the board, the Technical
Evaluation Panel, the commissioner of natural resources, and members of the public requesting a
copy at least 30 days prior to construction that indicate the location, amount, and type of wetlands to
be filled or drained by the project or, alternatively, convene an annual meeting of the parties required
to receive notice to review projects to be commenced during the upcoming year; and
    (3) for minor and emergency maintenance work impacting less than 10,000 square feet, submit
project-specific reports, within 30 days of commencing the activity, to the board that indicate the
location, amount, and type of wetlands that have been filled or drained.
    Those required to receive notice of public transportation projects may appeal minimization,
delineation, and on-site mitigation decisions made by the public transportation authority to the board
according to the provisions of section 103G.2242, subdivision 9. The Technical Evaluation Panel
shall review minimization and delineation decisions made by the public transportation authority and
provide recommendations regarding on-site mitigation if requested to do so by the local government
unit, a contiguous landowner, or a member of the Technical Evaluation Panel.
     Except for state public transportation projects, for which the state Department of Transportation
is responsible, the board must replace the wetlands, and wetland areas of public waters if authorized
by the commissioner or a delegated authority, drained or filled by public transportation projects on
existing roads.
    Public transportation authorities at their discretion may deviate from federal and state design
standards on existing road projects when practical and reasonable to avoid wetland filling or
draining, provided that public safety is not unreasonably compromised. The local road authority
and its officers and employees are exempt from liability for any tort claim for injury to persons or
property arising from travel on the highway and related to the deviation from the design standards
for construction or reconstruction under this paragraph. This paragraph does not preclude an action
for damages arising from negligence in construction or maintenance on a highway.

documentation. Within 30 days of its action to approve a change of wetland classifications, the
board shall publish a notice of the change in the Environmental Quality Board Monitor.
   ญ
   (ญ
    oญ) (p) One hundred citizens who reside within the jurisdiction of the local government unit may
request the local government unit to reclassify a county or watershed on the basis of its percentage of
presettlement wetlands remaining. In support of their petition, the citizens shall provide satisfactory
documentation to the local government unit. The local government unit shall consider the petition
and forward the request to the board under paragraph ญ (n

counties, or (iii) in one of the major watersheds that are wholly or partially within the seven-county
metropolitan area, but at least one to one must be replaced within the seven-county metropolitan
area.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in greater than 80 percent areas
may follow the priority order under this paragraph: (1) by wetland banking after evaluating on-site
replacement and replacement within the watershed; (2) replaced in an adjacent wetland bank service
area if wetland bank credits are not reasonably available in the same wetland bank service area as
the affected wetland, as determined by the local government unit or by a comprehensive inventory
approved by the board; and (3) statewide.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), siting wetland replacement in the seven-county metropolitan

    (ญ) (e) When reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial replacement opportunities
     cญ
are not available in siting priorities listed in paragraph (a), the applicant may seek opportunities at
the next level.

     ญญ) (f) For the purposes of this section, "reasonable, practicable, and environmentally beneficial
replacement opportunities" are defined as opportunities that:
   (1) take advantage of naturally occurring hydrogeomorphological conditions and require
minimal landscape alteration;
     (2) have a high likelihood of becoming a functional wetland that will continue in perpetuity;
   (3) do not adversely affect other habitat types or ecological communities that are important in
maintaining the overall biological diversity of the area; and
    (4) are available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing
technology, and logistics consistent with overall project purposes.

     Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103G.2242, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Wetland boundary or type determination. (a) A landowner may apply for a wetland
boundary or type determination from the local government unit. The landowner applying for the
determination is responsible for submitting proof necessary to make the determination, including,
but not limited to, wetland delineation field data, observation well data, topographic mapping, survey
mapping, and information regarding soils, vegetation, hydrology, and groundwater both within and
outside of the proposed wetland boundary.
    (b) A local government unit that receives an application under paragraph (a) may seek the
advice of the Technical Evaluation Panel as described in subdivision 2, and, if necessary, expand
the Technical Evaluation Panel. The local government unit may delegate the decision authority
for wetland boundary or type determinations w ญญt

    (c) The local government unit decision must be made in compliance with section 15.99.
Within ten calendar days of the decision, the local government unit decision must be mailed to
the landowner, members of the Technical Evaluation Panel, the watershed district or watershed
management organization, if one exists, and individual members of the public who request a copy.
    (d) Appeals of decisions made by designated local government staff must be made to the local
government unit. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a ruling on an appeal must be made by
the local government unit within 30 days from the date of the filing of the appeal.
   (e) The local government unit decision is valid for three years unless the Technical Evaluation
Panel determines that natural or artificial changes to the hydrology, vegetation, or soils of the area
have been sufficient to alter the wetland boundary or type.

   (1) the wetland owner;
   (2) any of those to whom notice is required to be mailed under subdivision 7; or
   (3) 100 residents of the county in which a majority of the wetland is located.
   (b) Within 30 days after receiving a petition, the board shall decide whether to grant the petition
and hear the appeal. The board shall grant the petition unless the board finds that:
   (1) the appeal is meritless, trivial, or brought solely for the purposes of delay;
   (2) the petitioner has not exhausted all local administrative remedies;
   (3) expanded technical review is needed;
   (4) the local government unit's record is not adequate; or
   (5) the petitioner has not posted a letter of credit, cashier's check, or cash if required by the local
government unit.
    (c) In determining whether to grant the appeal, the board shall also consider the size of the
wetland, other factors in controversy, any patterns of similar acts by the local government unit or
petitioner, and the consequences of the delay resulting from the appeal.
    (d) All appeals must be heard by the committee for dispute resolution of the board, and a decision
made within 60 days of filing the local government unit's record and the written briefs submitted for
the appeal. The decision must be served by mail on the parties to the appeal, and is not subject to
the provisions of chapter 14. A decision whether to grant a petition for appeal and a decision on the
merits of an appeal must be considered the decision of an agency in a contested case for purposes
of judicial review under sections 14.63 to 14.69.
    (e) Notwithstanding section 16A.1283, the board shall establish a fee schedule to defray the
administrative costs of appeals made to the board under this subdivision. Fees established under
this authority shall not exceed $1,000. Establishment of the fee is not subject to the rulemaking
process of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.

construction may be allowed for replacement unless specifically designated for replacement and
paid for by the individual or organization performing the wetland restoration, enhancement, or
construction, and is completed prior to any draining or filling of the wetland.
    (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to a wetland whose owner has paid back with interest the
individual or organization restoring, enhancing, or constructing the wetland.

agricultural land that was planted with annually seeded crops, was in a crop rotation seeding of
pasture grasses or legumes, or was in a land retirement program during the past ten years;
   (2) buffer areas of permanent native, noninvasive vegetative cover established or preserved on
upland adjacent to replacement wetlands;
    (3) wetlands restored for conservation purposes under terminated easements or contracts; and
    (4) water quality treatment ponds constructed to pretreat storm water runoff prior to discharge
to wetlands, public waters, or other water bodies, provided that the water quality treatment ponds
must be associated with an ongoing or proposed project that will impact a wetland and replacement
credit for the treatment ponds is based on the replacement of wetland functions and on an approved
stormwater management plan for the local government.

   "Sec. 12. PROMOTING STUDENT SUCCESS IN POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION.
    The Higher Education Advisory Council (HEAC) shall study and make recommendations
regarding (1) the role of merit and need-based scholarships and other mechanisms in improving
the participation and rate of student success in rigorous high school courses; and (2) mechanisms
to facilitate the subsequent access to, persistence in, and completion of postsecondary degrees
by students. The HEAC may collaborate with the P-16 Education Partnership in developing its
recommendations. The Minnesota Office of Higher Education shall provide support, as needed,
to complete the study. In completing the study and developing recommendations, the following
issues shall be addressed:
   (i) the parameters used to identify a course as being rigorous;
   (ii) the curricular prerequisites of courses identified to be rigorous;
    (iii) the extent to which rigorous courses are available to high school students throughout the
state;
   (iv) the capacity of high schools to provide rigorous courses to students;
   (v) the capacity of high schools to collaborate with postsecondary institutions to offer rigorous
courses;
    (vi) the programmatic and financial resources required to increase the participation of students
in rigorous courses;

    (vii) the role of college awareness programs and postsecondary institution outreach efforts in
informing students and families about the importance of adequate preparation for all postsecondary
education endeavors;
    (viii) the interventions required, and entities responsible for, assuring students have completed
the prerequisite subject matter required to enroll in rigorous courses;
   (ix) the programmatic and financial resources required to assure the retention and successful
degree completion of low-income students and students traditionally underrepresented in higher
education; and
   (x) other issues deemed critical to the preparation for and success of students in postsecondary
education.
The Higher Education Advisory Council shall, by December 15, 2007, make recommendations
to the senate and house committees with jurisdiction over higher education policy and finance
regarding the strategies that best inform and prepare students for postsecondary education and
work and career choices, with particular attention to strategies targeted to low-income students and
