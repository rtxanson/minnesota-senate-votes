                                 REPORTS OF COMMITTEES

   Senator Pogemiller moved that the Committee Reports at the Desk be now adopted. The motion
prevailed.

   Senator Moua from the Committee on Judiciary, to which was referred
    S.F. No. 2918: A bill for an act relating to mortgages; redemption period; providing for notice
of sale; amending Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 582.032, subdivision 2.
   Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 582.032, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Hearing; evidence; order. At the hearing on the summons and complaint or order to
show cause, the court shall enter an order reducing the mortgagor's redemption period as provided in
subdivision 2 or 3, as applicable, if evidence is presented supporting the allegations in the complaint
or motion and no appearance is made to oppose the relief sought. An affidavit by the sheriff or a
deputy sheriff of the county in which the mortgaged premises are located, or of a building inspector,
zoning administrator, housing official, or other municipal or county official having jurisdiction over
the mortgaged premises, stating that the mortgaged premises are not actually occupied and further
setting forth any of the following supporting facts, is prima facie evidence of abandonment:
    (1) windows or entrances to the premises are boarded up or closed off, or multiple window panes
are broken and unrepaired;
   (2) doors to the premises are smashed through, broken off, unhinged, or continuously unlocked;
83RD DAY]                         THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2008                                     6711

   (3) gas, electric, or water service to the premises has been terminated;
   (4) rubbish, trash, or debris has accumulated on the mortgaged premises;
    (5) the police or sheriff's office has received at least two reports of trespassers on the premises,
or of vandalism or other illegal acts being committed on the premises; or
   (6) the premises are deteriorating and are either below or are in imminent danger of falling below
minimum community standards for public safety and sanitation.
    An affidavit of the party foreclosing the mortgage or holding the sheriff's certificate, or one
of their agents or contractors, stating any of the above supporting facts, and that the affiant has
changed locks on the mortgaged premises under section 582.031 and that for a period of ten days
no party having a legal possessory right has requested entrance to the premises, is also prima facie
evidence of abandonment. Either affidavit described above, or an affidavit from any other person
having knowledge, may state facts supporting any other allegations in the complaint or motion and
is prima facie evidence of the same. Written statements of the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal
representatives or assigns, including documents of conveyance, which indicate a clear intent to
abandon the premises, are conclusive evidence of abandonment. In the absence of affidavits or
written statements, or if rebuttal evidence is offered by the defendant or a party lawfully claiming
through the defendant, the court may consider any competent evidence, including oral testimony,
concerning any allegation in the complaint or motion. A defendant's failure to appear at the hearing
after service of process in compliance with subdivision 6 is conclusive evidence of abandonment by
the defendant. An order entered under this section must contain a legal description of the mortgaged
premises."

    (a) The Department of Administration and the Department of Commerce, with the assistance of
other agencies, shall develop sustainable building design guidelines for all new state buildings by
January 15, 2003. The primary objectives of these guidelines are to ensure that all new state buildings
initially exceed existing energy code, as established in Minnesota Rules, chapter 7676, by at least 30
percent. The guidelines must focus on achieving the lowest possible lifetime cost for new buildings
and allow for changes in the guidelines that encourage continual energy conservation improvements
in new buildings. The design guidelines must establish sustainability guidelines that include air
quality and lighting standards and that create and maintain a healthy environment and facilitate
productivity improvements; specify ways to reduce material costs; and must consider the long-term
operating costs of the building, including the use of renewable energy sources and distributed electric
energy generation that uses a renewable source or natural gas or a fuel that is as clean or cleaner
than natural gas. In developing the guidelines, the departments shall use an open process, including
providing the opportunity for public comment. The guidelines established under this section are

approve and make grants for applied research and development projects of general applicability that
identify new technologies or strategies to maximize energy savings, improve the effectiveness of
energy conservation programs, or document the carbon dioxide reductions from energy conservation
programs. When approving projects, the commissioner shall consider proposals and comments from
utilities and other interested parties. The commissioner may assess up to $3,600,000 annually for the
purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to
the energy and conservation account created under subdivision 2a. An assessment made under this
subdivision is not subject to the cap on assessments provided by section 216B.62, or any other law.
    (b) The commissioner, as part of the assessment authorized under paragraph (a), shall annually
assess and grant up to $500,000 for the purpose of subdivision 9.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 216B.241, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9. Building performance standards; Sustainable Building 2030. (a) The purpose of
this subdivision is to establish cost-effective energy-efficiency performance standards for new and
substantially reconstructed commercial-industrial and institutional buildings that can substantially
reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel energy and reduce overall energy demand in new and
substantially reconstructed buildings. For the purposes of this subdivision, the establishment of these
standards may be referred to as Sustainable Building 2030.
    (b) The commissioner shall contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research at
the University of Minnesota to coordinate development and implementation of energy-efficiency
performance standards, strategic planning, research, data analysis, technology transfer, training,
and other activities related to the purpose of Sustainable Building 2030. The commissioner and
the Center for Sustainable Building Research shall, in consultation with utilities and experts in
building design and technology, develop a Sustainable Building 2030 implementation plan.
    (c) Sustainable Building 2030 energy-efficiency performance standards must be firm,
quantitative measures of total building energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions
per square foot for different building types and uses, that allow for accurate determinations
of a building's conformance with a performance standard. The energy-efficiency performance
standards shall be updated every three or five years to incorporate all cost-effective measures.
The performance standards must recognize the reductions in carbon intensity due to compliance
with the renewable energy standards in section 216B.1691. The performance standards should
be designed to achieve reductions to meet the following reduction schedule: (1) 60 percent in
2010; (2) 70 percent in 2015; (3) 80 percent in 2020; and (4) 90 percent in 2025. A performance
standard must not be established or increased absent a conclusive engineering analysis that the

higher performance standard would result in cost-effective improvements in building design and
construction. The determination of cost-effectiveness must be based upon established practices
used in evaluating utility conservation improvement programs.
    (d) The annual amount of the contract with the Center for Sustainable Building Research is up
to $500,000. The Center for Sustainable Building Research shall expend no more than $150,000 of
this amount each year on administration, coordination, and oversight activities related to Sustainable
Building 2030. The balance of contract funds must be spent for subcontracts with not-for-profit
energy organizations, architecture and engineering firms, and other qualified entities to undertake
technical projects and activities in support of Sustainable Building 2030. The primary work to be
accomplished each year by qualified technical experts under subcontracts is the development and
thorough justification of recommendations for specific energy-efficiency performance standards.
Additional work may include:
    (1) research, development, and demonstration of new energy-efficiency technologies and
techniques suitable for commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings;
    (2) analysis and evaluation of practices in building design, construction, commissioning and
operations, and analysis and evaluation of energy use in the commercial, industrial, and institutional
sectors;
   (3) analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Sustainable Building
2030 performance standards, conservation improvement programs, and building energy codes;
   (4) development and delivery of training programs for architects, engineers, commissioning
agents, technicians, contractors, equipment suppliers, developers, and others in the building
industries; and
   (5) analysis and evaluation of the effect of building operations on energy use.
    (e) The commissioner shall require utilities to develop and implement conservation
improvement programs that are expressly designed to achieve energy-efficiency goals consistent
with the Sustainable Building 2030 policy goal through implementation of the performance
standards. These programs must include offerings of design assistance and modeling, financial
incentives, and the verification of energy-efficient design components of new and substantially
reconstructed buildings. Utilities providing conservation improvement programs that lead to
meeting the 2030 standards may claim the energy savings as part of their goals for the conservation
improvement program.
   (f) The commissioner shall report to the legislature every three years on the cost-effectiveness
and progress of implementing the 2030 standards and shall make recommendations on the need to
continue the program as described in this section.

  Sec. 5. [216C.43] ENERGY IMPROVEMENT FINANCING PROGRAM FOR LOCAL
GOVERNMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Commissioner's authority and duties; local government authority. The
commissioner shall administer this section. A local government may enter into contracts for the
purposes of this section with the commissioner, the primary contractor, other contracted technical
service providers, and participating financial institutions.
    Subd. 2. Program eligibility; voluntary program participation; targeted technical services.
A local government may elect to participate in the program. The commissioner may prioritize
and target technical services offered under subdivision 5 to public entities that the commissioner
determines offer the greatest potential for cost-effective energy improvement projects.
   Subd. 3. Primary contractor for technical, financial, and program management services.
The commissioner may enter into a contract for the delivery of technical services, financial
management, marketing, and administrative services necessary for implementation of the program.
    Subd. 4. Targeted technical services. The commissioner shall offer technical services to
targeted public entities to conduct energy project studies. The commissioner may contract with
one or more qualified technical service providers to conduct energy project studies for targeted
public entities. The commissioner may require full or partial reimbursement of costs for technical

payments made by the local government under a financing agreement minus the amount loaned by
the commissioner do not exceed the actual energy and operating cost savings attributable to the
energy improvement project for the term of the guarantee.
Funds loaned to a local government by the commissioner in fulfillment of a guarantee are repayable
only to the extent that a positive budget impact is maintained during the term of the guarantee. Terms
and conditions of a guarantee must be agreed to by contract prior to a local government entering
into a financing agreement.
   (b) A guarantee contract must include, but is not limited to:
   (1) specification of methods and procedures to measure and verify energy cost savings;
   (2) obligations of the local government to operate and maintain the energy improvements;
    (3) procedures to modify the guarantee if the local government modifies operating characteristics
of its building or facility in a manner that adversely affects energy cost savings;
   (4) interest charged on the loan, which may not exceed the interest on the related financial
agreement; and
   (5) procedures for resolution of disputes.
    Subd. 8. Qualifying energy improvement projects. A local government may submit to the
commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, an application for a financing agreement
authorization and guarantee for energy improvement projects. The commissioner shall approve an
energy improvement project for a guarantee and authorize eligibility for a financing agreement if
the commissioner determines that:

employees. At the time a school hiring authority conducts a criminal history background check on
an individual offered employment as a teacher at the school, and consistent with section 13.43, the
school hiring authority also must use the Web site provided by the department's educator licensing
division to determine whether an asterisk appears in proximity with other licensure information. An
asterisk indicates that the individual has had disciplinary action taken against his or her teaching
license relating to sexual misconduct with a student. Sexual misconduct is defined as sexual contact
or attempted sexual contact between a teacher and a student. This may include physical contact
or verbal, written, or pictorial interactions. When an asterisk appears, the school hiring authority
must contact the state Board of Teaching before it hires the individual to determine the substance
of the disciplinary actions taken against that individual. In addition, the school hiring authority, as
part of the employment application, must require the individual to provide information about all
current and previous disciplinary actions in Minnesota and elsewhere taken against the individual's
teaching license as a result of sexual misconduct with a student and, notwithstanding other law to
the contrary, indicate to the individual that intentionally submitting false or incomplete information
is a ground for dismissal.
