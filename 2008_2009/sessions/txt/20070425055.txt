timber, including biomass, as appraised or scaled, at its discretion. Any parcels of land from which
timber is to be sold by scale of cut products shall be so designated in the published notice of sale
under paragraph (a), in which case the notice shall contain a description of the parcels, a statement
of the estimated quantity of each species of timber, and the appraised price of each species of timber
for 1,000 feet, per cord or per piece, as the case may be. In those cases any bids offered over and
above the appraised prices shall be by percentage, the percent bid to be added to the appraised price
of each of the different species of timber advertised on the land. The purchaser of timber from the
parcels shall pay in cash at the time of sale at the rate bid for all of the timber shown in the notice
of sale as estimated to be standing on the land, and in addition shall pay at the same rate for any
additional amounts which the final scale shows to have been cut or was available for cutting on the
land at the time of sale under the terms of the sale. Where the final scale of cut products shows
that less timber was cut or was available for cutting under terms of the sale than was originally
paid for, the excess payment shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of
the purchaser, to be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the
county. No timber, except hardwood pulpwood, may be removed from the parcels of land or other
designated landings until scaled by a person or persons designated by the county board and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources. Landings other than the parcel of land from which timber
is cut may be designated for scaling by the county board by written agreement with the purchaser
of the timber. The county board may, by written agreement with the purchaser and with a consumer
designated by the purchaser when the timber is sold by the county auditor, and with the approval
of the commissioner of natural resources, accept the consumer's scale of cut products delivered at
the consumer's landing. No timber shall be removed until fully paid for in cash. Small amounts of
timber not exceeding $3,000 in appraised valuation may be sold for not less than the full appraised
value at private sale to individual persons without first publishing notice of sale or calling for bids,
provided that in case of a sale involving a total appraised value of more than $200 the sale shall be

made subject to final settlement on the basis of a scale of cut products in the manner above provided
and not more than two of the sales, directly or indirectly to any individual shall be in effect at one
time.
    (d) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, and at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for use as cottage and camp sites
and for agricultural purposes and for the purpose of taking and removing of hay, stumpage, sand,
gravel, clay, rock, marl, and black dirt from the land, and for garden sites and other temporary uses
provided that no leases shall be for a period to exceed ten years; provided, further that any leases
involving a consideration of more than $12,000 per year, except to an organized subdivision of the
state shall first be offered at public sale in the manner provided herein for sale of timber. Upon
the sale of any leased land, it shall remain subject to the lease for not to exceed one year from the
beginning of the term of the lease. Any rent paid by the lessee for the portion of the term cut off by
the cancellation shall be refunded from the forfeited tax sale fund upon the claim of the lessee, to
be audited and allowed by the county board as in case of other claims against the county.
    (e) As directed by the county board, the county auditor may lease tax-forfeited land to
individuals, corporations, or organized subdivisions of the state at public or private sale, at the
prices and under the terms as the county board may prescribe, for the purpose of taking and
removing for use for road construction and other purposes tax-forfeited stockpiled iron-bearing
material. The county auditor must determine that the material is needed and suitable for use in
the construction or maintenance of a road, tailings basin, settling basin, dike, dam, bank fill, or
other works on public or private property, and that the use would be in the best interests of the
public. No lease shall exceed ten years. The use of a stockpile for these purposes must first be
approved by the commissioner of natural resources. The request shall be deemed approved unless
the requesting county is notified to the contrary by the commissioner of natural resources within
six months after receipt of a request for approval for use of a stockpile. Once use of a stockpile has
been approved, the county may continue to lease it for these purposes until approval is withdrawn
by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (f) The county auditor, with the approval of the county board is authorized to grant permits,
licenses, and leases to tax-forfeited lands for the depositing of stripping, lean ores, tailings, or waste
products from mines or ore milling plants, upon the conditions and for the consideration and for the
period of time, not exceeding 15 years, as the county board may determine. The permits, licenses,
or leases are subject to approval by the commissioner of natural resources.
    (g) Any person who removes any timber from tax-forfeited land before said timber has been
scaled and fully paid for as provided in this subdivision is guilty of a misdemeanor.
    (h) The county auditor may, with the approval of the county board, and without first offering
at public sale, grant leases, for a term not exceeding 25 years, for the removal of peat and for
the production or removal of farm-grown closed-loop biomass as defined in section 216B.2424,
subdivision 1, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands upon the terms and conditions
as the county board may prescribe. Any lease for the removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop
biomass, or short-rotation woody crops from tax-forfeited lands must first be reviewed and approved
by the commissioner of natural resources if the lease covers 320 or more acres. No lease for the
removal of peat, farm-grown closed-loop biomass, or short-rotation woody crops shall be made by
the county auditor pursuant to this section without first holding a public hearing on the auditor's

intention to lease. One printed notice in a legal newspaper in the county at least ten days before the
hearing, and posted notice in the courthouse at least 20 days before the hearing shall be given of the
hearing.
    (i) Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (c) to the contrary, the St. Louis County auditor
may, at the discretion of the county board, sell timber to the party who bids the highest price for all
the several kinds of timber, as provided for sales by the commissioner of natural resources under
section 90.14. Bids offered over and above the appraised price need not be applied proportionately
to the appraised price of each of the different species of timber.
    (j) In lieu of any payment or deposit required in paragraph (b), as directed by the county board
and under terms set by the county board, the county auditor may accept an irrevocable bank letter
of credit in the amount equal to the amount otherwise determined in paragraph (b). If an irrevocable
bank letter of credit is provided under this paragraph, at the written request of the purchaser, the
county may periodically allow the bank letter of credit to be reduced by an amount proportionate
to the value of timber that has been harvested and for which the county has received payment. The
remaining amount of the bank letter of credit after a reduction under this paragraph must not be less
than 20 percent of the value of the timber purchased. If an irrevocable bank letter of credit or cash
deposit is provided for the down payment required in paragraph (b), and no cutting of timber has
taken place on the contract for which a letter of credit has been provided, the county may allow the
transfer of the letter of credit to any other contract issued to the contract holder by the county under
this chapter to which the contract holder requests in writing that it be credited."

    Subdivision 1. Standards for district public defense eligibility. (a) Each judicial district must
screen requests for representation by the district public defender. A defendant is financially unable
to obtain counsel if:
   (1) the defendant, or any dependent of the defendant who resides in the same household as the
defendant, receives means-tested governmental benefits; or
    (2) the defendant, through any combination of liquid assets and current income, would be unable
to pay the reasonable costs charged by private counsel in that judicial district for a defense of the
same matter.
    (b) Upon a request for the appointment of counsel, the court shall make appropriate inquiry
into the financial circumstances of the applicant, who shall submit a financial statement under
oath or affirmation setting forth the applicant's assets and liabilities, including the value of any
real property owned by the applicant, whether homestead or otherwise, less the amount of any
encumbrances on the real property, the source or sources of income, and any other information
required by the court. The applicant shall be under a continuing duty while represented by a public
defender to disclose any changes in the applicant's financial circumstances that might be relevant to
the applicant's eligibility for a public defender. The state public defender shall furnish appropriate
forms for the financial statements. The forms must contain conspicuous notice of the applicant's
continuing duty to disclose to the court changes in the applicant's financial circumstances. The
forms must also contain conspicuous notice of the applicant's obligation to make a co-payment
for the services of the district public defender, as specified under paragraph (c). The information
contained in the statement shall be confidential and for the exclusive use of the court and the public

defender appointed by the court to represent the applicant except for any prosecution under section
609.48. A refusal to execute the financial statement or produce financial records constitutes a
waiver of the right to the appointment of a public defender. The court shall not appoint a district
public defender to a defendant who is financially able to retain private counsel but refuses to do so.
    An inquiry to determine financial eligibility of a defendant for the appointment of the district
public defender shall be made whenever possible prior to the court appearance and by such persons
as the court may direct. This inquiry may be combined with the prerelease investigation provided
for in Minnesota Rule of Criminal Procedure 6.02, subdivision 3. In no case shall the district public
defender be required to perform this inquiry or investigate the defendant's assets or eligibility. The
court has the sole duty to conduct a financial inquiry. The inquiry must include the following:
      (1) the liquidity of real estate assets, including the defendant's homestead;
      (2) any assets that can be readily converted to cash or used to secure a debt;
      (3) the determination of whether the transfer of an asset is voidable as a fraudulent conveyance;
and
   (4) the value of all property transfers occurring on or after the date of the alleged offense. The
burden is on the accused to show that he or she is financially unable to afford counsel. Defendants
who fail to provide information necessary to determine eligibility shall be deemed ineligible. The
court must not appoint the district public defender as advisory counsel.

full-time employees within the state on a single working day during the previous 12 months unless
the commissioner has approved the business' plan to establish equitable compensation relationships
for its employees and has issued the business a certificate of compliance. A certificate of compliance

in compliance with equitable compensation relationship standards or is making a good faith effort

relationships for a business under this section are the same as the standards in sections 471.991 to
471.997 and rules adopted under those sections.
  (b) A business that is not in compliance with equitable compensation relationship standards is
making a good faith effort to achieve compliance if the commissioner has approved:

the commissioner's recommendations; and

commissioner's review.

certificate of compliance issued by the commissioner under this section. The proceeds of the fee
must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a pay equity fee special revenue account.
Money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner to fund the cost of administering this
section.
    Subd. 4. Revocation of certificate. A certificate of compliance may be suspended or revoked
by the commissioner if a holder of a certificate is not effectively implementing or making a good
faith effort to implement its approved plan to establish equitable compensation relationships. If a
contractor does not effectively implement its approved plan, or fails to make a good faith effort to
do so, the commissioner of employee relations may refuse to approve subsequent plans submitted
by that business.
    Subd. 5. Revocation of contract. A contract awarded by a department or agency of the state
may be terminated or abridged by the contracting department or agency because of suspension
or revocation of a certificate. If a contract is awarded to a business that does not have a contract
compliance certificate as required, the commissioner of administration may void the contract on
behalf of the state.
    Subd. 6. Technical assistance. If the commissioner has suspended a contractor's certificate of
compliance, the commissioner shall provide technical assistance that may enable the contractor to
be recertified within 90 days after the contractor's certificate has been suspended.
    Subd. 7. Access to data. Data submitted to the commissioner by a contractor or potential
contractor for purposes of obtaining a certificate of compliance under this section are private data
on individuals or nonpublic data with respect to persons other than department employees. The
commissioner's decision to grant, not grant, revoke, or suspend a certificate of compliance is public
