The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 2822 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 2822 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. [604.18] INSURANCE STANDARD OF CONDUCT.
   Subdivision 1. Terms. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings given
them.
    (a) "Insurance policy" means a written agreement between an insured and an insurer that
obligates an insurer to pay proceeds directly to an insured. Insurance policy does not include
provisions of a written agreement obligating an insurer to defend an insured, reimburse an insured's
defense expenses, provide for any other type of defense obligation, or provide indemnification for
judgments or settlements. Insurance policy does not include:
   (1) coverage for workers' compensation insurance under chapter 176;
   (2) a written agreement of a health carrier, as defined in section 62A.011;
    (3) a contract issued by a nonprofit health service plan corporation regulated under chapter 62C
that provides only dental coverage;
   (4) a written agreement authorized under section 60A.06, subdivision 1, clause (4) or (6), or
64B.16, subdivision 1; or
   (5) a written agreement issued pursuant to section 67A.191.
    (b) "Insured" means a person who, or an entity which, qualifies as an insured under the terms of
an insurance policy on which a claim for coverage is made. An insured does not include any person
or entity claiming a third-party beneficiary status under an insurance policy.
    (c) "Insurer" means every insurer, corporation, business trust, or association engaged in
insurance as a principal licensed or authorized to transact insurance under section 60A.06, but for
purposes of this section an insurer does not include a political subdivision providing self-insurance
or a pool of political subdivisions under section 471.981, subdivision 3. The term does not include
the Joint Underwriting Association operating under chapter 62F or 62I.
102ND DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2008                                         8601

  Subd. 2. Liability. (a) The court may award as taxable costs to an insured against an insurer
amounts as provided in subdivision 3 if the insured can show:
   (1) the absence of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the insurance policy; and
    (2) that the insurer knew of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the insurance
policy or acted in reckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the benefits of the
insurance policy.
    (b) A violation of this section shall not be the basis for any claim or award under chapter 325D
or 325F.
   (c) An insurer does not violate this subdivision by conducting or cooperating with a timely
investigation into arson or fraud.
    Subd. 3. Damages and costs. (a) In addition to prejudgment and postjudgment interest and costs
and disbursements allowed under law, the court may award an insured the following taxable costs
for a violation of subdivision 2:
    (1) an amount equal to one-half of the proceeds awarded that are in excess of an amount offered
by the insurer at least ten days before the trial begins or $250,000, whichever is less; and
   (2) reasonable attorney fees actually incurred to establish the insurer's violation of this section.
    Attorney fees may be awarded only if the fees sought are separately accounted for by the
insured's attorney and are not duplicative of the fees for the insured's attorney otherwise expended
in pursuit of proceeds for the insured under the insurance policy. Attorney fees must not exceed
$100,000.
    (b) An insured may not also recover punitive or exemplary damages or attorney fees under
section 8.31 for a violation of this section.
    Subd. 4. Claim for taxable costs. (a) Upon commencement of a civil action by an insured against
an insurer, the complaint must not seek a recovery under this section. After filing the suit, a party
may make a motion to amend the pleadings to claim recovery of taxable costs under this section.
The motion must allege the applicable legal basis under this section for awarding taxable costs under
this section, and must be accompanied by one or more affidavits showing the factual basis for the
motion. The motion may be opposed by the submission of one or more affidavits showing there is
no factual basis for the motion. At the hearing, if the court finds prima facie evidence in support
of the motion, the court may grant the moving party permission to amend the pleadings to claim
taxable costs under this section.
    (b) An award of taxable costs under this section shall be determined by the court in a proceeding
subsequent to any determination by a fact finder of the amount an insured is entitled to under the
insurance policy, and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in Minnesota General Rules of
Practice, Rule 119.
   (c) An award of taxable costs under this section is not available in any claim that is resolved or
confirmed by arbitration or appraisal.
   (d) The following are not admissible in any proceeding that seeks taxable costs under this section:
8602                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [102ND DAY

    (1) findings or determinations made in arbitration proceedings conducted under section 65B.525
or rules adopted under that section;
   (2) allegations involving, or results of, investigations, examinations, or administrative
proceedings conducted by the Department of Commerce;
   (3) administrative bulletins or other informal guidance published or disseminated by the
Department of Commerce; and
   (4) provisions under chapters 59A to 79A and rules adopted under those sections are not
admissible as standards of conduct.
    (e) A claim for taxable costs under this section may not be assigned. This paragraph does not
affect the assignment of rights not established in this section.
    Subd. 5. Insurance producers; liability limited. A licensed insurance producer is not liable
under this section for errors, acts, or omissions attributed to the insurer that appointed the producer
to transact business on its behalf, except to the extent the producer has caused or contributed to the
error, act, or omission.
    Sec. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.
    Section 1 is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to causes of action for conduct that occurs on
or after that date."
    Delete the title and insert:
    "A bill for an act relating to insurance; providing for penalties and recovery of attorney fees
for certain insurance claims practices; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter
604."

    Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with a sponsor must be for the term contained in the contract according to subdivision
6. The sponsor may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground listed in
paragraph (b). A sponsor may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the contract for
any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating a contract, the
sponsor shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed action in writing. The
notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and that the charter school's
board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the sponsor within 14 days of
receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to
make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to
the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the sponsor shall give
reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The sponsor shall
conduct an informal hearing before taking final action. The sponsor shall take final action to renew
or not renew a contract by the last day of classes in the school year. If the sponsor is a local board,
the school's board of directors may appeal the sponsor's decision to the commissioner.
   (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
   (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
   (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
   (3) violations of law; or
   (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 308A or 317A, except when the commissioner
approves the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school.
     (c) If at the end of a contract term, either the sponsor or the charter school board of directors wants
to voluntarily terminate the contract, a change in sponsors is allowed if the commissioner approves
the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school. The commissioner shall
consider whether the charter school and prospective new sponsor have addressed any outstanding
issues raised by the previous sponsor when determining whether to grant the change of sponsor.
The party intending to terminate the contract must notify the other party and the commissioner of
its intent at least 90 days before the date on which the contract ends. The sponsor that is a party to
the existing contract at least must inform the approved different eligible sponsor about the fiscal and
student performance of the school. If no different eligible sponsor is approved, the school must be
dissolved according to applicable law and the terms of the contract.
   (d) The commissioner, after providing reasonable notice to the board of directors of a charter
school and the existing sponsor, and after providing an opportunity for a public hearing, may

for the purchase price, including interest, if any; and
   (2) annually levy the amounts necessary to pay the district's obligations under the installment
contract or lease purchase agreement.
    (b) The obligation created by the installment contract or the lease purchase agreement must not

debt under other law. An election is not required in connection with the execution of the installment
contract or the lease purchase agreement.

    (e) A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation
requirements that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A
school district that incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school
year must provide students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the
opportunity to earn a diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in
effect when the students entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve
instruction or curriculum as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with
sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and 120B.20.
   (f) The commissioner must include the contributions of Minnesota American Indian tribes and
communities as they relate to the academic standards during the review and revision of the required
academic standards.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment except that
paragraph (a), clause (5), applies to students entering the ninth grade in the 2009-2010 school year

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Rigorous course of study; waiver. (a) Upon receiving a student's application signed
by the student's parent or guardian, a school district, area learning center, or charter school must
declare that a student meets or exceeds a specific academic standard required for graduation under
this section if the local school board, the school board of the school district in which the area learning
center is located, or the charter school board of directors determines that the student:
    (1) is participating in a course of study, including an advanced placement or international
baccalaureate course or program; a learning opportunity outside the curriculum of the district,
area learning center, or charter school; or an approved preparatory program for employment or
postsecondary education that is equally or more rigorous than the corresponding state or local
academic standard required by the district, area learning center, or charter school;
    (2) would be precluded from participating in the rigorous course of study, learning opportunity,
or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program if the student were required to
achieve the academic standard to be waived; and
   (3) satisfactorily completes the requirements for the rigorous course of study, learning
opportunity, or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program.
Consistent with the requirements of this section, the local school board, the school board of the
school district in which the area learning center is located, or the charter school board of directors
also may formally determine other circumstances in which to declare that a student meets or exceeds
a specific academic standard that the site requires for graduation under this section.
    (b) A student who satisfactorily completes a postsecondary enrollment options course or
program under section 124D.09, or an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course
or program under section 120B.13, is not required to complete other requirements of the academic
standards corresponding to that specific rigorous course of study.

with subdivision 1a.
   (e) In addition to the testing and reporting requirements under this section, the commissioner
shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations, alternate assessments, or exemptions
consistent with applicable federal law, only with parent or guardian approval, for those very few
students for whom the student's individual education plan team under sections 125A.05 and 125A.06
determines that the general statewide test is inappropriate for a student, or for a limited English
proficiency student under section 124D.59, subdivision 2;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
    (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.

reading, mathematics, and science assessments aligned with state academic standards that districts

and sites must use to monitor student growth toward achieving those standards. The commissioner
must not develop statewide assessments for academic standards in social studies, health and
physical education, and the arts. The commissioner must require:
    (1) annual reading and mathematics assessments in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school
level for the 2005-2006 school year and later; and

year and later.
     (b) The commissioner must ensure that all statewide tests administered to elementary and
secondary students measure students' academic knowledge and skills and not students' values,
attitudes, and beliefs.
   (c) Reporting of assessment results must:
    (1) provide timely, useful, and understandable information on the performance of individual
students, schools, school districts, and the state;
   (2) include, by no later than the 2008-2009 school year, a value-added component that is in
addition to a measure for student achievement growth over time; and
    (3)(i) for students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, determine whether
students have met the state's basic skills requirements; and
    (ii) for students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, determine whether
students have met the state's academic standards.
    (d) Consistent with applicable federal law and subdivision 1, paragraph (d), clause (1),
the commissioner must include appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternative
assessments for the very few students with disabilities for whom statewide assessments are
inappropriate and for students with limited English proficiency.
    (e) A school, school district, and charter school must administer statewide assessments under this
section, as the assessments become available, to evaluate student progress in achieving the academic
standards. If a state assessment is not available, a school, school district, and charter school must
determine locally if a student has met the required academic standards. A school, school district, or
charter school may use a student's performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria
to determine grade promotion or retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a
high school student's performance on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final
grade in a course, or place a student's assessment score on the student's transcript.
    Subd. 2. Department of Education assistance. The Department of Education shall contract for
professional and technical services according to competitive bidding procedures under chapter 16C
for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. Reporting. The commissioner shall report test data publicly and to stakeholders,
including the performance achievement levels developed from students' unweighted test scores
in each tested subject and a listing of demographic factors that strongly correlate with student
performance. The commissioner shall also report data that compares performance results among

school sites, school districts, Minnesota and other states, and Minnesota and other nations. The
commissioner shall disseminate to schools and school districts a more comprehensive report
containing testing information that meets local needs for evaluating instruction and curriculum.
    Subd. 4. Access to tests. The commissioner must adopt and publish a policy to provide public
and parental access for review of basic skills tests, Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments, or any
other such statewide test and assessment. Upon receiving a written request, the commissioner must
make available to parents or guardians a copy of their student's actual responses to the test questions

used in the program and the process for inspection;
   (3) if the program is presented by school district personnel or outside consultants, and if outside
consultants are used, who they may be; and
   (4) parents' or guardians' right to choose not to have the child participate in the program and the
procedure for exercising that right.
    (d) A school district must establish policies and procedures for reasonably restricting the
availability of written and audiovisual educational materials from public view of students who
have been excused from all or part of a responsible family life and sexuality education program at
the request of a parent or guardian, consistent with paragraph (e) and this section.
   (e) A school district may develop a policy for a parent, guardian, or adult student age 18 or older

   (b) "Environmentally sensitive cleaning and maintenance products" means cleaning and
maintenance products that minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment.
   (c) "School" has the meaning given under section 120A.22, subdivision 4, excluding home
schools.
    Subd. 2. Use of environmentally sensitive cleaning and maintenance products. By September
1, 2009, a school may follow specifications regarding the purchase and use of environmentally
sensitive cleaning and maintenance products, where economically feasible. A school may deplete
existing cleaning and maintenance product supplies purchased prior to this date. A school shall
annually review the school's cleaning and maintenance product purchasing practices.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­­
                   l­a b­e
                        l­­, valid, replicated evidence showing that when these programs or practices
are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory reading progress. The
program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, instruction in five areas of reading:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and ­e    t­x­­
                                                                            t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
    (b) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
    (c) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships between
written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that stresses
learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and spelling.
   (d) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read orally with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
   (e) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
8626                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [102ND DAY

learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.
    (f) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.

respective positions.
    (b) The board must require a person to successfully complete an examination of skills in
reading, writing, and mathematics before being granted an initial teaching license to provide direct
instruction to pupils in prekindergarten, elementary, secondary, or special education programs.
In addition, the board must require a person to successfully complete an assessment of reading
instruction consistent with subdivision 2c before being granted an initial teaching license to
provide direct instruction to pupils in prekindergarten or elementary programs. The board must
require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program to provide
remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in their
institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination or an assessment of
reading instruction, including those for whom English is a second language. The colleges and
universities must provide assistance in the specific academic areas of deficiency in which the
person did not achieve a qualifying score. School districts must provide similar, appropriate, and
timely remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component and mentoring to those
persons employed by the district who completed their teacher education program outside the state
of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach in Minnesota and did not achieve a qualifying
score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English is a second language.
The Board of Teaching shall report annually to the education committees of the legislature on the
total number of teacher candidates during the most recent school year taking the skills examination,
the number who achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the number who do not achieve
a qualifying score on the examination, the distribution of all candidates' scores, the number of
candidates who have taken the examination at least once before, and the number of candidates who
have taken the examination at least once before and achieve a qualifying score.
    (c) A person who has completed an approved teacher preparation program and obtained a
one-year license to teach, but has not successfully completed the skills examination, may renew
the one-year license for two additional one-year periods. Each renewal of the one-year license is
contingent upon the licensee:
   (1) providing evidence of participating in an approved remedial assistance program provided
by a school district or postsecondary institution that includes a formal diagnostic component in the
specific areas in which the licensee did not obtain qualifying scores; and
    (2) attempting to successfully complete the skills examination during the period of each one-year
license.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from June 30, 2007.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) A sponsor may authorize one or more licensed teachers under
section 122A.18, subdivision 1, to operate a charter school subject to approval by the commissioner.
A board must vote on charter school application for sponsorship no later than 90 days after receiving
the application. The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A or
nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply
to the school except as provided in this section. Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a
school district may create a corporation for the purpose of creating a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may form and operate a school, the sponsor must file an affidavit with
the commissioner stating its intent to authorize a charter school. The affidavit must demonstrate the
sponsor's abilities, capacities, and expertise in fulfilling the responsibilities of a sponsor and state the
terms and conditions under which the sponsor would authorize a charter school and how the sponsor
intends to oversee the fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the
terms of the written contract between the sponsor and the charter school board of directors under
subdivision 6 in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The sponsor must submit an
affidavit to the commissioner for each charter school it proposes to authorize. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove the sponsor's proposed authorization within 90 days of receipt of the
affidavit. Failure to obtain commissioner approval precludes a sponsor from authorizing the charter
school that was the subject of the affidavit.
    (c) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as a
cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish
a board of directors composed of at least five nonrelated members until a timely election for members
of the charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws. A
charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members. Any staff members
who are employed at the school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a
cooperative, and all parents of children enrolled in the school m

election for members of the school's board of directors. Licensed teachers employed at the school,
including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, must be a majority of
the members of the board of directors before the school completes its third year of operation, unless
the commissioner waives the requirement for a majority of licensed teachers on the board. Board of
director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.
   (d) The granting or renewal of a charter by a sponsoring entity must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
    (e) The granting or renewal of a charter school by a sponsor must not be contingent on the
charter school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the sponsor. A sponsor is
prohibited from entering into a contract to provide management and financial services for a school
that it is authorized to sponsor.
   (f) A sponsor may authorize the operators of a charter school to expand the operation of the
8632                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [102ND DAY

in the sponsor's application as approved by the commissioner only after submitting a supplemental
application to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The
supplemental application must provide evidence that:
   (1) the expansion of the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
   (2) the charter school is fiscally sound;
   (3) the sponsor supports the expansion; and
    (4) the building of the additional site meets all health and safety requirements to be eligible for
lease aid.
   ­(­) (g) The commissioner annually must provide timely financial management training to newly
     f­
elected members of a charter school board of directors and ongoing training to other members of a
charter school board of directors. Training must address ways to:
   (1) proactively assess opportunities for a charter school to maximize all available revenue
sources;
   (2) establish and maintain complete, auditable records for the charter school;
   (3) establish proper filing techniques;
    (4) document formal actions of the charter school, including meetings of the charter school board
of directors;
   (5) properly manage and retain charter school and student records;
   (6) comply with state and federal payroll record-keeping requirements; and
    (7) address other similar factors that facilitate establishing and maintaining complete records on
the charter school's operations.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) A member of a charter school board of directors is prohibited
from serving as a member of the board of directors or as an employee or agent of or a contractor
with a for-profit entity with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional
services, goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable at the option
of the commissioner. The charter school's state aid may be reduced by the commissioner under
section 127A.42 if the charter school board fails to correct violations under this subdivision in a
timely manner. A member of a charter school board of directors who violates this prohibition shall
be individually liable to the charter school for any damage caused by the violation.
   (b) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
    (c) A member of a charter school board of directors that serves as a member of the board of
directors or as an employee or agent of or a contractor with a nonprofit entity with whom the charter

    Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with a sponsor must be for the term contained in the contract according to subdivision
6. The sponsor may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground listed in
paragraph (b). A sponsor may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the contract for
any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating a contract,
the sponsor shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed action in writing
by registered mail. The notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail
and that the charter school's board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before
the sponsor within 14 days of receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure
by the board of directors to make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall
be treated as acquiescence to the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a
hearing, the sponsor shall give reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the
hearing date. The sponsor shall conduct an informal hearing before taking final action. The sponsor
shall take final action to renew or not renew a contract ­by­­­h

   125A.15 PLACEMENT IN ANOTHER DISTRICT; RESPONSIBILITY.
    The responsibility for special instruction and services for a child with a disability temporarily
placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
    (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
   (b) If the placement of a pupil for care and treatment is not made by the district of residence, the
102ND DAY]                          MONDAY, APRIL 14, 2008                                        8639

district of residence must be notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement
decision. When an immediate emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident
district participation in the placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed,
if different from the district of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency
placement within 15 days of the placement. When placement has been made without prior
consultation with the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days following
notice of the emergency placement to respond and must, at that time, be provided an opportunity
to participate in the placement decision.
    (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
f­
­a­i­i
  c­l­t
      ­y
       ­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may
establish reasonable restrictions on transportation; however, if a court or state agency has ordered
the placement at the day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the
order, the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency otherwise orders. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of ­h t­­
                        e that district. The resident district may provide the educational program at a
school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­

However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be the
district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational program
in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­
                                                                                 c­

    ­
    (­
     e­
      ) (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

  125A.51 PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES; EDUCATION
AND TRANSPORTATION.
    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When placement has been made without prior consultation with the resident district, the
resident district has up to five business days following notice of the emergency placement to respond
and must, at that time, be provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­

                                        ­y­ program for the pupil. The resident district may establish
reasonable restrictions on transportation; however, if a Minnesota court or state agency has ordered
the placement at the day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the
order, the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency otherwise orders. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of ­h t­­
                                e that district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely

written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract
with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

Services under the medical assistance fee for service claims processing system for special education
services which are covered services under chapter 256B, which are provided in the school setting
for a medical assistance recipient, and for whom the district has secured informed consent consistent
with section 13.05, subdivision 4, paragraph (d), and section 256B.77, subdivision 2, paragraph (p),

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.522, is amended to read:
   124D.522 ADULT BASIC EDUCATION SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE GRANTS.
    (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the policy review task force under section 124D.521,
may make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide services that are not offered by a district
adult basic education program or that are supplemental to either the statewide adult basic education
program, or a district's adult basic education program. The commissioner may make grants for:
staff development for adult basic education teachers and administrators; training for volunteer
tutors; training, services, and materials for serving disabled students through adult basic education
programs; statewide promotion of adult basic education services and programs; development and
dissemination of instructional and administrative technology for adult basic education programs;
programs which primarily serve communities of color; adult basic education distance learning
projects, including television instruction programs; and other supplemental services to support the
mission of adult basic education and innovative delivery of adult basic education services.
    (b) The commissioner must establish eligibility criteria and grant application procedures. Grants
under this section must support services throughout the state, focus on educational results for
adult learners, and promote outcome-based achievement through adult basic education programs.
Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the commissioner may make grants under this section from the state
total adult basic education aid set aside for supplemental service grants under section 124D.531. Up
to one-fourth of the appropriation for supplemental service grants must be used for grants for adult
basic education programs to encourage and support innovations in adult basic education instruction
and service delivery. A grant to a single organization cannot exceed $    ­­

total supplemental services aid. Nothing in this section prevents an approved adult basic education
program from using state or federal aid to purchase supplemental services.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.55, is amended to read:
   124D.55 GENERAL EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT (GED) TEST FEES.
    The commissioner shall pay 60 percent of the fee that is charged to an eligible individual for
the full battery of a general education development (GED) test, but not more than ­$­
                                                                                    20­ $40 for an
eligible individual."
