    (d) Unless all proposals are rejected, the commissioner shall award the contract to the responsive
and responsible design-builder with the lowest adjusted score. The commissioner shall reserve the
right to reject all proposals.
    (e) The commissioner shall not limit the ability of design-builders that have submitted
proposals to protest a contemplated or actual award by the commissioner by, among other things,
unreasonably restricting the time to protest, restricting the right to seek judicial review of the
commissioner's actions, attempting to change the judicial standard of review, or attempting to shift
the commissioner's costs or damages from a protest to a protestor. Before executing a contract for
the project, the commissioner shall wait at least seven days after all of the following have occurred:
the award of the project; public disclosure of the Technical Review Committee's scoring data; and
public identification of the successful proposal.
      Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.3426, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Stipulated fee. The commissioner shall award a stipulated fee not less than two-tenths
of one percent of the department's estimated cost of design and construction to each short-listed,
responsible proposer who provides a responsive but unsuccessful proposal. Any increases to the
stipulated fee must be made only by the commissioner and the reasons for those changes must be
publicly announced at the time of the change. If the commissioner does not award a contract, all
short-listed proposers must receive the stipulated fee. If the commissioner cancels the contract before
reviewing the technical proposals, the commissioner shall award each design-builder on the short
list a stipulated fee of not less than two-tenths of one percent of the commissioner's estimated cost of
design and construction. The commissioner shall pay the stipulated fee to each proposer within 90
days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract without conditions other
than those stated in this subdivision. In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the commissioner
may use any ideas or information contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded
for the project or in connection with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any
additional compensation to the unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this subdivision, an unsuccessful short-list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an
unsuccessful short-list proposer elects to waive the stipulated fee, the commissioner may not use
ideas and information contained in that proposer's proposal. Upon the request of the commissioner,
a proposer who waived a stipulated fee may withdraw the waiver, in which case the commissioner
shall pay the stipulated fee to the proposer and thereafter may use ideas and information in the
proposer's proposal.
      Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.3426, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
   Subd. 4. Low-bid design-build process. (a) The commissioner may also use low-bid,

clearly defined.
   (b) Low-bid design-build projects may require a request for qualifications (RFQ) and
short-listing, and must require a request for proposals (RFP).
    (c) Submitted proposals under this subdivision must include separately a technical proposal and
a price proposal. The low-bid, design-build procedures must follow a two-step process for review
of the responses to the RFP as follows:
    (1) The first step is the review of the technical proposal by the Technical Review Committee
as provided in section 161.3420, subdivision 2. The Technical Review Committee must open the
technical proposal first and must determine if it complies with the requirements of the RFP and
is responsive. The Technical Review Committee shall reject any nonresponsive proposal. The
Technical Review Committee may not perform any ranking or scoring of the technical proposals.
   (2) The second step is the determination of the low bidder based on the price proposal. The
commissioner may not open the price proposal until the review of the technical proposal is complete.
   (d) The contract award under low-bid, design-build procedures must be made to the proposer
whose sealed bid is responsive to the technical requirements ­

intersecting and adjoining local roads.
    Subd. 2. Federal project funding. The commissioner of transportation shall make all reasonable
efforts, as promptly as possible, to obtain from the Federal Highway Administration a commitment
to provide federal-aid highway funding for the state and local units of government involved in state
project number 6915-129.
   Subd. 3. Local approval. The county of St. Louis and the cities of Duluth and Hermantown
shall execute all necessary documents, including cooperative construction agreements.
    Subd. 4. Contract award. Upon receipt of all necessary documents signifying participation of
affected local government units, and receipt of assurance of federal-aid highway funding for the
project, the commissioner of transportation shall award a contract for construction of the project
to the lowest bidder among the bids that were submitted for the project as described in the plans,
standard specifications for construction, and special provisions for state project number 6915-129
as represented in the bidding documents on file in the office of the commissioner of transportation

    Subd. 5. Contract execution. The lowest bidder may execute the awarded contract no later than
ten days after the contract is awarded. If the lowest bidder does not execute the contract within ten

6915-129 that are described only in the bidding documents on file in the office of the commissioner
of transportation for advertisement on May 16, 2008, must be paid for as "extra work" as provided

    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16A.10, subdivision 1c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1c. Performance measures for change items. For each change item in the budget
proposal requesting new or increased funding, the budget document must present proposed
performance measures that can be used to determine if the new or increased funding is
accomplishing its goals. To the extent possible, each budget change item must identify relevant
Minnesota Milestones and other statewide goals and indicators related to the proposed initiative.
By June 15 of each even-numbered year, the commissioner must report to the Subcommittee on
Government Accountability established under section 3.885, subdivision 11, regarding the format
and process to be used for the presentation and selection of Minnesota Milestones and other
statewide goals and indicators. By July 15 of each even-numbered year, the subcommittee must
recommend the format and process for use in the preparation of the budget documents.

agency development and purchase of information and communications systems, equipment, and
services is designed to ensure that individual agency information systems complement and do not
needlessly duplicate or conflict with the systems of other agencies. When state agencies have need

architecture;
   (2) ensure the agency's proposed purchase reflects a cost-effective policy regarding volume
purchasing; and

data can be shared among agencies, unless the office determines that the agency purchasing the
equipment has special needs justifying the inconsistency.

that these systems are operated efficiently and securely and continually meet the standards and
guidelines established by the office. The standards and guidelines must emphasize uniformity

of a licensed physician and with the consent of the other intended parent, if any, is inseminated using
semen from a donor other than an intended parent, the other intended parent is treated in law as the

   (b) The intended parents are treated in law as if they were the biological parents of a child
gestated and delivered if a woman undergoing embryo transfer is under the supervision of a licensed
physician and has the consent of the other intended parent, if any, and:
   (1) the embryos are created with eggs and sperm donated by persons who are not the intended

transfer.
