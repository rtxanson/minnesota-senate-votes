   "Sec. 9. NANOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FUND PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Program established; purpose. The nanotechnology development fund
program (NDF) is established to develop a collaborative economic development initiative between
the state of Minnesota, the private sector, and multiple academic institutions to promote by small
businesses an increased use of advanced nanoinstrumentation for characterization, fabrication,
and other related processes; provide research consulting by knowledgeable specialists; and
provide student internship opportunities to increase nanotechnology experience by working with
small, medium, or large Minnesota companies. The NDF program shall be administered by the
Department of Employment and Economic Development and is not a state agency.
   Subd. 2. Definition; qualifying Minnesota small business. "Qualifying Minnesota small
business" means:
   (1) a Minnesota small business corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership that has fewer
than 50 employees; or
   (2) a Minnesota business corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership that:
   (i) has 51 to 100 employees; and
   (ii) demonstrates current financial adversity or risk or a major prospect of aiding the business's
long-term outlook by significant use of nanotechnology in the business's offerings.
   Subd. 3. Grants. The commissioner shall extend onetime matching grants from the NDF to

qualifying Minnesota small businesses located throughout the state to:
   (1) add nanotechnology applications to products that are being developed by Minnesota small
businesses to enhance distinctiveness;
   (2) promote the depth, breadth, and value of technologies being developed by Minnesota
businesses with the aid of nanotechnology;
   (3) encourage more frequent use of nanoinstrumentation to speed businesses' product
time-to-market, with higher incidence of distinct product characteristics;
      (4) provide Minnesota small businesses with broader access to experienced research consultants;
and
      (5) increase the number of researchers experienced in working with nanoinstrumentation.
   Subd. 4. Grant application and award procedure. (a) The commissioner may give priority to
applicants:
   (1) whose intellectual property would benefit from utilization of nanoinstrumentation not
possessed in-house;
    (2) who are currently utilizing nanoinstrumentation either at the University of Minnesota or a
private sector location on a leased, hourly basis; and
      (3) who wish to increase their access to experienced research consultants.
      (b) The commissioner shall decide whether to award a grant to an eligible applicant based on:
    (1) the applicant's planned frequency of usage of nanoinstrumentation for characterization,
fabrication, and other related processes; and
    (2) the applicant's demonstration of rental of nanoinstrumentation, in the form of a signed
affidavit from a certified facility to confirm the one-to-one private sector investment has been met.
      (c) A grant made under this section must:
      (1) include verification of matching rental fees or internship stipends paid by the grantee; and
    (2) be for a total amount paid to each grantee of not less than $500 nor more than $20,000 within
the biennium.
    Subd. 5. Administration. The commissioner of employment and economic development must
develop and maintain a record-keeping system that specifies how funds from the NDF are applied
for and distributed. Businesses receiving grants from the NDF must provide contact information,
the date and time of the use of the nanoinstrumentation, proof of their matching contribution to meet
the rental costs or provide an internship's stipend, and a general statement of the expected outcome
from the use of the nanoinstrumentation, to the extent documentation can be made without divulging
proprietary information.
    Subd. 6. Gifts and donations. Gifts and donations, including land or interests in land, may be
made to NDF. Noncash gifts and donations must be disposed of for cash as soon as the commissioner
of employment and economic development can prudently maximize the value of the gift or donation.

                              . The license fee for each initial and renewal master plumber's license shall be
$120. The license fee for each initial and renewal journeyman plumber's license shall be $55. The
commissioner may by rule prescribe for the expiration and renewal of licenses. Any licensee who
does not renew a license within two years after the license expires is no longer eligible for renewal.
Such an individual must retake and pass the examination before a new license will be issued. A
journeyman or master plumber who submits a license renewal application after the time specified
in rule but within two years after the license expired must pay all past due renewal fees plus a late
fee of $25."

     The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 145 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 145 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
                                             "ARTICLE 1
                                     GENERAL PROVISIONS
   Section 1. TITLE.
   This act may be cited as the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216C.05, is amended to read:
   216C.05 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
    Subdivision 1. Energy planning. The legislature finds and declares that continued growth in
demand for energy will cause severe social and economic dislocations, and that the state has a vital
interest in providing for: increased efficiency in energy consumption, the development and use of
renewable energy resources wherever possible, and the creation of an effective energy forecasting,
planning, and education program.
    The legislature further finds and declares that the protection of life, safety, and financial security
for citizens during an energy crisis is of paramount importance.
    Therefore, the legislature finds that it is in the public interest to review, analyze, and encourage
those energy programs that will minimize the need for annual increases in fossil fuel consumption
by 1990 and the need for additional electrical generating plants, and provide for an optimum
combination of energy sources consistent with environmental protection and the protection of
citizens.
    The legislature intends to monitor, through energy policy planning and implementation, the
transition from historic growth in energy demand to a period when demand for traditional fuels
becomes stable and the supply of renewable energy resources is readily available and adequately
utilized.
   Subd. 2. Energy policy goals. It is the energy policy of the state of Minnesota that:
    (1) the per capita use of fossil fuel as an energy input be reduced by 15 percent by the year 2015,
through increased reliance on energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives; and

    (2) 25 percent of the total energy used in the state be derived from renewable energy resources
by the year 2025.

     Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.16, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
     Subdivision 1. Notice. Unless the commission otherwise orders, no public utility shall
change a rate which has been duly established under this chapter, except upon 60 days' notice
to the commission. The notice shall include statements of facts, expert opinions, substantiating
documents, and exhibits, supporting the change requested, and state the change proposed to be
made in the rates then in force and the time when the modified rates will go into effect. If the
filing utility does not have an approved energy conservation improvement plan on file with the
department, it shall also include in its notice an energy conservation plan pursuant to section
216B.241. A filing utility subject to rate regulation under section 216B.026 shall reference in its
notice the energy conservation improvement plans of the generation and transmission cooperative
providing energy conservation improvement programs to members of the filing utility pursuant to
section 216B.241. The filing utility shall give written notice, as approved by the commission, of
the proposed change to the governing body of each municipality and county in the area affected.
All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new schedules or shall be plainly indicated upon
schedules on file and in force at the time.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.16, subdivision 6b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6b. Energy conservation improvement. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
subdivision, all investments and expenses of a public utility as defined in section 216B.241,

   (vi) the magnitude and timing of any known future electric utility projects that the utility may
seek to recover under this section;
   (vii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's base revenue as approved by the
commission in the electric utility's most recent general rate case, exclusive of fuel cost adjustments;
    (viii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's capital expenditures since its most
recent general rate case;
   (ix) the amount of time since the utility last filed a general rate case and the utility's reasons for
seeking recovery outside of a general rate case;
   (x) documentation supporting the calculation of the EUIC; and
   (xi) a cost and benefit analysis showing that the electric utility infrastructure project is in the
public interest.
   (c) Upon approval of the proposed projects and associated EUIC rate schedule, the utility may

   Subd. 3. Commission authority; orders. The commission may issue orders necessary to
implement and administer this section.
   Sec. 4. [216B.2401] ENERGY CONSERVATION POLICY GOAL.
    It is the energy policy of the state of Minnesota to achieve annual energy savings equal to
1.5 percent of annual retail energy sales of electricity and natural gas directly through energy
conservation improvement programs and rate design, and indirectly through energy codes and
appliance standards, programs designed to transform the market or change consumer behavior,
energy savings resulting from efficiency improvements to the utility infrastructure and system, and
other efforts to promote energy efficiency and energy conservation.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.241, is amended to read:
   216B.241 ENERGY CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENT.

provided in the state;
    (2) for a utility that furnishes electric service, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from
service provided in the state; and
    (3) for a utility that furnishes electric service and that operates a nuclear-powered electric
generating plant within the state, two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided
in the state.
    For purposes of this paragraph (a), "gross operating revenues" do not include revenues from
large electric customer facilities exempted by the commissioner under paragraph (b).
      (b) The owner of a large electric customer facility may petition the commissioner to exempt
both electric and gas utilities serving the large energy customer facility from the investment and
expenditure requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to retail revenues attributable to the facility.
At a minimum, the petition must be supported by evidence relating to competitive or economic
pressures on the customer and a showing by the customer of reasonable efforts to identify, evaluate,
and implement cost-effective conservation improvements at the facility. If a petition is filed on or
before October 1 of any year, the order of the commissioner to exempt revenues attributable to the
facility can be effective no earlier than January 1 of the following year. The commissioner shall
not grant an exemption if the commissioner determines that granting the exemption is contrary
to the public interest. The commissioner may, after investigation, rescind any exemption granted
under this paragraph upon a determination that ­                           co

   (b) Each cooperative electric association and municipality subject to this subdivision shall spend
and invest for energy conservation improvements under this subdivision the following amounts:
    (1) for a municipality, 0.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from the sale of gas and
1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from the sale of electricity, excluding gross operating
revenues from electric and gas service provided in the state to large electric customer facilities; and
    (2) for a cooperative electric association, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from service
provided in the state, excluding gross operating revenues from service provided in the state to large
electric customer facilities indirectly through a distribution cooperative electric association.
    (c) Each municipality and cooperative electric association subject to this subdivision shall
identify and implement energy conservation improvement spending and investments that are
appropriate for the municipality or association, except that a municipality or association may not
spend or invest for energy conservation improvements that directly benefit a large energy facility
or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has issued an exemption under
subdivision 1a, paragraph (b).
    (d) Each municipality and cooperative electric association subject to this subdivision may spend
and invest annually up to ten percent of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy
conservation improvements under this subdivision on research and development projects that meet
the definition of energy conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by
the municipality or cooperative electric association.

   (i) The commissioner shall consider and may require a utility, association, or other entity
providing energy efficiency and conservation services under this section to undertake a program
suggested by an outside source, including a political subdivision, nonprofit corporation, or
community organization.
    Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation

improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent to
1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under paragraph
(d). The savings goals must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather normalized
average.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy savings plan by calendar year 2010.
    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request
the commissioner to adjust its annual energy savings percentage goal based on its historical
conservation investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential
study, or other factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner
may not approve a plan that provides for an annual energy savings goal of less than one percent of
gross annual retail energy sales from energy conservation improvements. A utility or association
may include in its energy conservation plan energy savings from electric utility infrastructure
projects approved by the commission under section 216B.1636 or waste heat recovery converted
into electricity projects that may count as energy savings in addition to the minimum energy savings
goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements. Electric utility infrastructure
projects must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that which would have occurred
through normal maintenance activity.
    (e) An energy savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments to attain
the energy savings goals of this subdivision that are not cost-effective even if the investment is
necessary to attain the energy savings goals. For the purpose of this paragraph, in determining
cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and benefits to ratepayers, the
utility, participants, and society. In addition, the commissioner shall consider the rate at which an
association or municipal utility is increasing its energy savings and its expenditures on energy
conservation.
    (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available. The
commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity filing
an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner.
    (h) By January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall report to the legislature whether the spending
requirements under subdivisions 1a and 1b are necessary to achieve the energy savings goals
established in this subdivision.

    The commissioner shall evaluate energy conservation improvement programs on the basis of
cost-effectiveness and the reliability of the technologies employed. The commissioner shall, by
order, establish, maintain, and update energy savings assumptions that must be used when filing
energy conservation improvement programs. The commissioner shall establish an inventory of
the most effective energy conservation programs, techniques, and technologies, and encourage
all Minnesota utilities to implement them, where appropriate, in their service territories. The
commissioner shall describe these programs in sufficient detail to provide a utility reasonable
guidance concerning implementation. The commissioner shall prioritize the opportunities in order
of potential energy savings and in order of cost-effectiveness. The commissioner may contract with
a third party to carry out any of the commissioner's duties under this subdivision, and to obtain
technical assistance to evaluate the effectiveness of any conservation improvement program. The
commissioner may assess up to $800,000 annually until June 30, 2009, and $450,000 annually
thereafter for the purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited in the state
treasury and credited to the energy and conservation account created under subdivision 2a. An
assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to the cap on assessments provided by
section 216B.62, or any other law.
    Subd. 1e. Applied research and development grants. The commissioner may, by order,
approve and make grants for applied research and development projects of general applicability
that identify new technologies or strategies to maximize energy savings, improve the effectiveness
of energy conservation programs, or document the carbon dioxide reductions from energy
conservation programs. When approving projects, the commissioner shall consider proposals
and comments from utilities and other interested parties. The commissioner may assess up to
$3,600,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited in
the state treasury and credited to the energy and conservation account created under subdivision
2a. An assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to the cap on assessments provided
by section 216B.62, or any other law.
   Subd. 1f. Facilities energy efficiency. (a) The commissioner of administration and the
commissioner of commerce shall maintain and, as needed, revise the sustainable building design
guidelines developed under section 16B.325.
    (b) The commissioner of administration and the commissioner of commerce shall maintain
and update the benchmarking tool developed under Laws 2001, chapter 212, article 1, section 3,
so that all public buildings can use the benchmarking tool to maintain energy use information for
the purposes of establishing energy efficiency benchmarks, tracking building performance, and
measuring the results of energy efficiency and conservation improvements.
   (c) The commissioner shall require that utilities include in their conservation improvement
plans programs that facilitate professional engineering verification to qualify a building as
Energy Star-labeled, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified, or Green
Globes-certified. The state goal is to achieve certification of 1,000 commercial buildings as Energy

    (d) The commissioner may assess up to $500,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision.
The assessments must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the energy and conservation
account created under subdivision 2a. An assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to
the cap on assessments provided by section 216B.62, or any other law.
     Subd. 2. Programs. (a) The commissioner may require public utilities to make investments and
expenditures in energy conservation improvements, explicitly setting forth the interest rates, prices,
and terms under which the improvements must be offered to the customers. The required programs
must cover no more than a ­             fo­u

basis of cost-effectiveness and the reliability of technologies employed. The commissioner's order
must provide to the extent practicable for a free choice, by consumers participating in the program,
of the device, method, material, or project constituting the energy conservation improvement and
for a free choice of the seller, installer, or contractor of the energy conservation improvement,
provided that the device, method, material, or project seller, installer, or contractor is duly licensed,
certified, approved, or qualified, including under the residential conservation services program,
where applicable.
   (b) The commissioner may require a utility to make an energy conservation improvement
investment or expenditure whenever the commissioner finds that the improvement will result in
energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an
equivalent amount of new supply of energy. The commissioner shall nevertheless ensure that every
public utility operate one or more programs under periodic review by the department.
    (c) Each public utility subject to subdivision 1a may spend and invest annually up to ten percent
of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy conservation improvements under
this section by the utility on research and development projects that meet the definition of energy
conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by the public utility.
    (d) A public utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large energy facility or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (b). The commissioner shall consider and
may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including a political
subdivision o r, a nonprofit corporation, or community organization.

    (g

suggested a program, the attorney general acting on behalf of consumers and small business
interests, or a utility customer that has suggested a program and is not represented by the attorney
general under section 8.33 may petition the commission to modify or revoke a department
decision under this section, and the commission may do so if it determines that the program is
not cost-effective, does not adequately address the residential conservation improvement needs of
low-income persons, has a long-range negative effect on one or more classes of customers, or is
otherwise not in the public interest. The commission shall reject a petition that, on its face, fails to
make a reasonable argument that a program is not in the public interest.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (f) The commissioner may order a public utility to include, with the filing of the utility's
proposed conservation improvement plan under paragraph (a), the results of an independent audit
of the utility's conservation improvement programs and expenditures performed by the department
or an auditor with experience in the provision of energy conservation and energy efficiency services
approved by the commissioner and chosen by the utility. The audit must specify the energy savings
or increased efficiency in the use of energy within the service territory of the utility that is the
result of the spending and investments. The audit must evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utility's
conservation programs.

    Subd. 2b. Recovery of expenses. The commission shall allow a utility to recover expenses
resulting from a conservation improvement program required by the department and contributions
and assessments to the energy and conservation account, unless the recovery would be inconsistent
with a financial incentive proposal approved by the commission. The commission shall allow
a cooperative electric association subject to rate regulation under section 216B.026, to recover
expenses resulting from energy conservation improvement programs, load management programs,
and assessments and contributions to the energy and conservation account unless the recovery
would be inconsistent with a financial incentive proposal approved by the commission. In addition,
a utility may file annually, or the Public Utilities Commission may require the utility to file, and
the commission may approve, rate schedules containing provisions for the automatic adjustment
of charges for utility service in direct relation to changes in the expenses of the utility for real
and personal property taxes, fees, and permits, the amounts of which the utility cannot control. A
public utility is eligible to file for adjustment for real and personal property taxes, fees, and permits
under this subdivision only if, in the year previous to the year in which it files for adjustment, it
has spent or invested at least 1.75 percent of its gross revenues from provision of electric service,
excluding gross operating revenues from electric service provided in the state to large electric
customer facilities for which the commissioner has issued an exemption under subdivision 1a,
paragraph (b), and 0.6 percent of its gross revenues from provision of gas service, excluding gross
operating revenues from gas services provided in the state to large electric customer facilities for
which the commissioner has issued an exemption under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b), for that year
for energy conservation improvements under this section.
   Subd. 2c. Performance incentives. By December 31, 2008, the commission shall review
any incentive plan for energy conservation improvement it has approved under section 216B.16,
subdivision 6c, and adjust the utility performance incentives to recognize making progress toward
and meeting the energy savings goals established in subdivision 1c.
    Subd. 3. Ownership of energy conservation improvement. An energy conservation
improvement made to or installed in a building in accordance with this section, except systems
owned by the utility and designed to turn off, limit, or vary the delivery of energy, are the exclusive
property of the owner of the building except to the extent that the improvement is subjected to
a security interest in favor of the utility in case of a loan to the building owner. The utility has
no liability for loss, damage or injury caused directly or indirectly by an energy conservation
improvement except for negligence by the utility in purchase, installation, or modification of the
product.
    Subd. 4. Federal law prohibitions. If investments by public utilities in energy conservation
improvements are in any manner prohibited or restricted by federal law and there is a provision under
which the prohibition or restriction may be waived, then the commission, the governor, or any other
necessary state agency or officer shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to secure a waiver
with respect to those public utility investments in energy conservation improvements included in
this section.
   Subd. 5. Efficient lighting program. (a) Each public utility, cooperative electric association,
and municipal utility that provides electric service to retail customers shall include as part of its
conservation improvement activities a program to strongly encourage the use of fluorescent and

high-intensity discharge lamps. The program must include at least a public information campaign
to encourage use of the lamps and proper management of spent lamps by all customer classifications.
    (b) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to 200,000 or more customers shall
establish, either directly or through contracts with other persons, including lamp manufacturers,
distributors, wholesalers, and retailers and local government units, a system to collect for delivery
to a reclamation or recycling facility spent fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps from
households and from small businesses as defined in section 645.445 that generate an average of
fewer than ten spent lamps per year.
    (c) A collection system must include establishing reasonably convenient locations for collecting
spent lamps from households and financial incentives sufficient to encourage spent lamp generators
to take the lamps to the collection locations. Financial incentives may include coupons for purchase
of new fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps, a cash back system, or any other financial
incentive or group of incentives designed to collect the maximum number of spent lamps from
households and small businesses that is reasonably feasible.
   (d) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to fewer than 200,000 customers,
a cooperative electric association, or a municipal utility that provides electric service at retail to
customers may establish a collection system under paragraphs (b) and (c) as part of conservation
improvement activities required under this section.
    (e) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency may not, unless clearly required by
federal law, require a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipality that establishes
a household fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamp collection system under this section to
manage the lamps as hazardous waste as long as the lamps are managed to avoid breakage and
are delivered to a recycling or reclamation facility that removes mercury and other toxic materials
contained in the lamps prior to placement of the lamps in solid waste.
   (f) If a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal utility contracts with a local
government unit to provide a collection system under this subdivision, the contract must provide for
payment to the local government unit of all the unit's incremental costs of collecting and managing
spent lamps.
    (g) All the costs incurred by a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal
utility for promotion and collection of fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps under this
subdivision are conservation improvement spending under this section.
    Subd. 6. Renewable energy research. (a) A public utility that owns a nuclear generation
facility in the state shall spend five percent of the total amount that utility is required to spend under
this section to support basic and applied research and demonstration activities at the University of
Minnesota Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment for the development of renewable
energy sources and technologies. The utility shall transfer the required amount to the University
of Minnesota on or before July 1 of each year and that annual amount shall be deducted from the
amount of money the utility is required to spend under this section. The University of Minnesota
shall transfer at least ten percent of these funds to at least one rural campus or experiment station.
   (b) Research funded under this subdivision shall include:
   (1) development of environmentally sound production, distribution, and use of energy,

chemicals, and materials from renewable sources;
    (2) processing and utilization of agricultural and forestry plant products and other bio-based,
renewable sources as a substitute for fossil-fuel-based energy, chemicals, and materials using a
variety of means including biocatalysis, biorefining, and fermentation;
    (3) conversion of state wind resources to hydrogen for energy storage and transportation to areas
of energy demand;
   (4) improvements in scalable hydrogen fuel cell technologies; and
   (5) production of hydrogen from bio-based, renewable sources; and sequestration of carbon.
    (c) Notwithstanding other law to the contrary, the utility may, but is not required to, spend more
than two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided in this state under this section
or section 216B.2411.
   (d) This subdivision expires June 30, 2008.
     Subd. 7. Low-income programs. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that each utility and
association provides low-income programs. When approving spending and energy savings goals
for low-income programs, the commissioner shall consider historic spending and participation
levels, energy savings for low-income programs, and the number of low-income persons residing in
the utility's service territory. A utility that furnishes gas service must spend at least 0.2 percent of its
gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. A utility
or association that furnishes electric service must spend at least 0.1 percent of its gross operating
revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. For a generation and
transmission cooperative association, this requirement shall apply to each association's members'
aggregate gross operating revenue from sale of electricity to residential customers in the state.
Beginning in 2010, a utility or association that furnishes electric service must spend 0.2 percent of
its gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs.
    (b) To meet the requirements of paragraph (a), a utility or association may contribute money
to the energy and conservation account. An energy conservation improvement plan must state the
amount, if any, of low-income energy conservation improvement funds the utility or association
will contribute to the energy and conservation account. Contributions must be remitted to the
commissioner by February 1 of each year.
    (c) The commissioner shall establish low-income programs to utilize money contributed to
the energy and conservation account under paragraph (b). In establishing low-income programs,
the commissioner shall consult political subdivisions, utilities, and nonprofit and community
organizations, especially organizations engaged in providing energy and weatherization assistance
to low-income persons. Money contributed to the energy and conservation account under paragraph
(b) must provide programs for low-income persons, including low-income renters, in the service
territory of the utility or association providing the money. The commissioner shall record and report
expenditures and energy savings achieved as a result of low-income programs funded through the
energy and conservation account in the report required under subdivision 1c, paragraph (g). The
commissioner may contract with a political subdivision, nonprofit or community organization,
public utility, municipality, or cooperative electric association to implement low-income programs
funded through the energy and conservation account.

   (d) A utility or association may petition the commissioner to modify its required spending under
paragraph (a) if the utility or association and the commissioner have been unable to expend the
amount required under paragraph (a) for three consecutive years.
    Subd. 8. Assessment. The commission or department may assess utilities subject to this section
in proportion to their respective gross operating revenue from sales of gas or electric service within
the state during the last calendar year to carry out the purposes of subdivisions 1d, 1e, and 1f. Those
assessments are not subject to the cap on assessments provided by section 216B.62, or any other
law.
   Sec. 6. [216B.2412] DECOUPLING OF ENERGY SALES FROM REVENUES.
    Subdivision 1. Definition and purpose. For the purpose of this section, "decoupling" means a
regulatory tool designed to separate a utility's revenue from changes in energy sales. The purpose
of decoupling is to reduce a utility's disincentive to promote energy efficiency.
    Subd. 2. Decoupling criteria. The commission shall, by order, establish criteria and standards
for decoupling. The commission shall design the criteria and standards to mitigate the impact on
public utilities of the energy savings goals under section 216B.241 without adversely affecting utility
ratepayers. In designing the criteria, the commission shall consider energy efficiency, weather, and
cost of capital, among other factors.
    Subd. 3. Pilot programs. The commission shall allow one or more rate-regulated utilities to
participate in a pilot program to assess the merits of a rate-decoupling strategy to promote energy
efficiency and conservation. Each pilot program must utilize the criteria and standards established
in subdivision 2 and be designed to determine whether a rate-decoupling strategy achieves energy
savings. On or before a date established by the commission, the commission shall require electric
and gas utilities that intend to implement a decoupling program to file a decoupling pilot plan, which
shall be approved or approved as modified by the commission. A pilot program may not exceed
three years in length. Any extension beyond three years can only be approved in a general rate
case, unless that decoupling program was previously approved as part of a general rate case. The
commission shall report on the programs annually to the chairs of the house of representatives and
senate committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy.
   Sec. 7. [216C.03] STATE GOVERNMENT ENERGY SAVINGS PLAN.
    The commissioner of commerce, in coordination with the commissioners of the agencies listed
in section 15.01, the chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, and the president
of the University of Minnesota, shall identify policy options, barriers, and economic benefits and
costs for state government operations to achieve the energy savings goals in section 216B.2401 and
the resulting carbon emission reductions. The commissioner of commerce must issue a report to the
legislature by February 1, 2008.
   Sec. 8. REVISOR'S INSTRUCTION.
    The revisor of statutes shall change the reference to "section 216B.241, subdivision 1, paragraph
(i)" found in section 216B.2411, subdivision 1, to read "section 216B.241, subdivision 1."

       Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.345, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
       Subd. 13. Energy efficiency projects. The following definitions apply to this subdivision.
   (a) "Energy conservation measure" means a training program or facility alteration designed to
reduce energy consumption or operating costs and includes:
       (1) insulation of the building structure and systems within the building;
   (2) storm windows and doors, caulking or weatherstripping, multiglazed windows and doors,
heat absorbing or heat reflective glazed and coated window and door systems, additional glazing,
reductions in glass area, and other window and door system modifications that reduce energy
consumption;
       (3) automatic energy control systems;
       (4) heating, ventilating, or air conditioning system modifications or replacements;
    (5) replacement or modifications of lighting fixtures to increase the energy efficiency of the
lighting system without increasing the overall illumination of a facility, unless an increase in
illumination is necessary to conform to the applicable state or local building code for the lighting
system after the proposed modifications are made;
       (6) energy recovery systems;
    (7) cogeneration systems that produce steam or forms of energy such as heat, as well as
electricity, for use primarily within a building or complex of buildings;
       (8) energy conservation measures that provide long-term operating cost reductions.

     (b) "Guaranteed energy savings contract" means a contract for the evaluation and
recommendations of energy conservation measures, and for one or more energy conservation
measures. The contract must provide that all payments, except obligations on termination of the
contract before its expiration, are to be made over time, but not to exceed 15 years from the date
of final installation, and the savings are guaranteed to the extent necessary to make payments for
the systems.
   (c) "Qualified provider" means a person or business experienced in the design, implementation,
and installation of energy conservation measures. A qualified provider to whom the contract is
awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the municipality for its faithful performance.
   Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy
savings contract with a qualified provider to significantly reduce energy or operating costs.
    Before entering into a contract under this subdivision, the municipality shall provide published
notice of the meeting in which it proposes to award the contract, the names of the parties to the
proposed contract, and the contract's purpose.
    Before installation of equipment, modification, or remodeling, the qualified provider shall first
issue a report, summarizing estimates of all costs of installations, modifications, or remodeling,
including costs of design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, or debt service, and
estimates of the amounts by which energy or operating costs will be reduced.
    A guaranteed energy savings contract that includes a written guarantee that savings will meet or
exceed the cost of energy conservation measures is not subject to competitive bidding requirements
of section 471.345 or other law or city charter. The contract is not subject to section 123B.52.
     A municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider
if, after review of the report, it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation
measures recommended in the report is not likely to exceed the amount to be saved in energy and
operation costs over 15 years from the date of installation if the recommendations in the report were
followed, and the qualified provider provides a written guarantee that the energy or operating cost
savings will meet or exceed the costs of the system. The guaranteed energy savings contract may
provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed 15 years.
    A municipality may enter into an installment payment contract for the purchase and installation
of energy conservation measures. The contract must provide for payments of not less than 1/15 of
the price to be paid within two years from the date of the first operation, and the remaining costs to
be paid monthly, not to exceed a 15-year term from the date of the first operation.
    A municipality entering into a guaranteed energy savings contract shall provide a copy of the
contract and the report from the qualified provider to the commissioner of commerce within 30 days
of the effective date of the contract.
    Guaranteed energy savings contracts may extend beyond the fiscal year in which they become
effective. The municipality shall include in its annual appropriations measure for each later fiscal
year any amounts payable under guaranteed energy savings contracts during the year. Failure of a
municipality to make such an appropriation does not affect the validity of the guaranteed energy
savings contract or the municipality's obligations under the contracts.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 504B.161, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

    Subdivision 1. Requirements. (a) In every lease or license of residential premises, the landlord
or licensor covenants:
     (1) that the premises and all common areas are fit for the use intended by the parties;
    (2) to keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license, except when
the disrepair has been caused by the willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct of the tenant or
licensee or a person under the direction or control of the tenant or licensee; ­

    (3) to make the premises reasonably energy efficient by installing weatherstripping, caulking,
storm windows, and storm doors when any such measure will result in energy procurement cost
savings, based on current and projected average residential energy costs in Minnesota, that will
exceed the cost of implementing that measure, including interest, amortized over the ten-year period
following the incurring of the cost; and
    (4) to maintain the premises in compliance with the applicable health and safety laws of the
state, ­n

C-BED tariff may only apply to the portion of the energy production of the total project that is
directly proportional to the equity share of the project owned by the qualifying owners.
    (d) A project that is operating under a power purchase agreement under a C-BED tariff is not
eligible for net energy billing under section 216B.164, subdivision 3, or for production incentives
under section 216C.41.
    (e) A public utility must receive commission approval of a power purchase agreement for a
C-BED tariffed project. The commission shall provide the utility's ratepayers an opportunity to
address the reasonableness of the proposed power purchase agreement. Unless a party objects to

commission to approve a rate schedule that provides for the automatic adjustment of charges to
recover prudently incurred investments, expenses, or costs associated with facilities constructed,
owned, or operated by a utility to satisfy the requirements of section 216B.1691, provided those
facilities were previously approved by the commission under section 216B.2422 or 216B.243. The
commission may approve, or approve as modified, a rate schedule that:
   (1) allows a utility to recover directly from customers on a timely basis the costs of qualifying
renewable energy projects, including:
   (i) return on investment;
   (ii) depreciation;
   (iii) ongoing operation and maintenance costs;
   (iv) taxes; and
   (v) costs of transmission and other ancillary expenses directly allocable to transmitting electricity
generated from a project meeting the specifications of this paragraph;
   (2) provides a current return on construction work in progress, provided that recovery of these
costs from Minnesota ratepayers is not sought through any other mechanism;
   (3) allows recovery of other expenses incurred that are directly related to a renewable energy
project, provided that the utility demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction that the expenses
improve project economics, ensure project implementation, or facilitate coordination with the
development of transmission necessary to transport energy produced by the project to market;
   (4) allocates recoverable costs appropriately between wholesale and retail customers;
    (5) terminates recovery when costs have been fully recovered or have otherwise been reflected
in a utility's rates.
   (b) A petition filed under this subdivision must include:
   (1) a description of the facilities for which costs are to be recovered;
   (2) an implementation schedule for the facilities;
   (3) the utility's costs for the facilities;
   (4) a description of the utility's efforts to ensure that costs of the facilities are reasonable and
were prudently incurred; and

    (5) a description of the benefits of the project in promoting the development of renewable energy
in a manner consistent with this chapter.
    Sec. 9. [216B.1681] CURTAILMENT PAYMENTS.
    The commission shall conduct a study of curtailment payments for wind energy projects to
assess whether utilities are unduly discriminating among project ownership structures in regard to
the contractual availability of curtailment payments. The commission shall submit the study to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with
primary jurisdiction over energy policy by January 15, 2008.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.1691, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 7. Utility acquisition of resources. A competitive resource acquisition process
established by the commission prior to June 1, 2007, shall not apply to a utility for the construction,
ownership, and operation of generation facilities used to satisfy the requirements of this section
unless, upon a finding that it is in the public interest, the commission issues an order on or after
June 1, 2007, that requires compliance by a utility with a competitive resource acquisition process.
A utility that owns a nuclear generation facility and intends to construct, own, or operate facilities
under this section shall file with the commission on or before March 1, 2008, a renewable energy
plan setting forth the manner in which the utility proposes to meet the requirements of this section,
including a proposed schedule for purchasing renewable energy from C-BED and non-C-BED
projects. The utility shall update the plan as necessary in its filing under section 216B.2422. The
commission shall approve the plan unless it determines, after public hearing and comment, that the
plan is not in the public interest. As part of its determination of public interest, the commission
shall consider the plan's allocation of projects among C-BED, non-C-BED, and utility-owned
projects, balancing the state's interest in:
   (1) promoting the policy of economic development in rural areas through the development of
renewable energy projects, as expressed in subdivision 9;
    (2) maintaining the reliability of the state's electric power grid; and
    (3) minimizing cost impacts on ratepayers.

   Sec. 12. [216F.011] SIZE DETERMINATION.
    (a) The total size of a combination of wind energy conversion systems for the purpose of
determining what jurisdiction has siting authority under this chapter must be determined according
to this section. The nameplate capacity of one wind energy conversion system must be combined
with the nameplate capacity of any other wind energy conversion system that:
   (1) is located within five miles of the wind energy conversion system;
   (2) is constructed within the same 12-month period as the wind energy conversion system; and
    (3) exhibits characteristics of being a single development, including, but not limited to,
ownership structure, an umbrella sales arrangement, shared interconnection, revenue sharing
arrangements, and common debt or equity financing.
    (b) The commissioner shall provide forms and assistance for project developers to make a
request for a size determination. Upon written request of a project developer, the commissioner of
commerce shall provide a written size determination within 30 days of receipt of the request and
of any information requested by the commissioner. In the case of a dispute, the chair of the Public
Utilities Commission shall make the final size determination.
    (c) An application to a county for a permit under this chapter for a wind energy conversion
system is not complete without a size determination made under this section.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 15, 2008.
   Sec. 13. [216F.08] PERMIT AUTHORITY; ASSUMPTION BY COUNTIES.
    (a) A county board may, by resolution and upon written notice to the Public Utilities
Commission, assume responsibility for processing applications for permits required under this
chapter for LWECS with a combined nameplate capacity of less than 25,000 kilowatts. The
responsibility for permit application processing, if assumed by a county, may be delegated by the
county board to an appropriate county officer or employee. Processing by a county shall be done in
74TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 20, 2007                                         5955

accordance with procedures and processes established under chapter 394.
   (b) A county board that exercises its option under paragraph (a) may issue, deny, modify, impose
conditions upon, or revoke permits pursuant to this section. The action of the county board about a
permit application is final, subject to appeal as provided in section 394.27.
    (c) The commission shall, by order, establish general permit standards, including appropriate
property line set-backs, governing site permits for LWECS under this section. The order must
consider existing and historic commission standards for wind permits issued by the commission.
The general permit standards shall apply to permits issued by counties and to permits issued by
the commission for LWECS with a combined nameplate capacity of less than 25,000 kilowatts.
The commission or a county may grant a variance from a general permit standard if the variance is
found to be in the public interest.
   (d) The commission and the commissioner of commerce shall provide technical assistance to a
county with respect to the processing of LWECS site permit applications.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 15, 2008.
   Sec. 14. [216F.081] APPLICATION OF COUNTY STANDARDS.
    A county may adopt by ordinance standards for LWECS that are more stringent than standards
in commission rules or in the commission's permit standards. The commission, in considering a
permit application for LWECS in a county that has adopted more stringent standards, shall consider
and apply those more stringent standards, unless the commission finds good cause not to apply the
standards.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 500.30, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Like any conveyance. Any property owner may grant a solar or wind easement in the
same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in real property. The easements
shall be created in writing and shall be filed, duly recorded, and indexed in the office of the recorder
of the county in which the easement is granted. No duly recorded easement shall be unenforceable
on account of lack of privity of estate or privity of contract; such easements shall run with the land
or lands benefited and burdened and shall constitute a perpetual easement, except that an easement
may terminate upon the conditions stated therein or pursuant to the provisions of section 500.20. A
wind easement, easement to install wind turbines on real property, option, or lease of wind rights
shall also terminate after seven years from the date the easement is created or lease is entered into,
if a wind energy project on the property to which the easement or lease applies does not begin
commercial operation within the seven-year period.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment, and applies
to wind easements created and wind rights leases entered into on and after the effective date of this
section.
   Sec. 16. RESOURCE ASSESSMENT.
    The reliability administrator shall conduct an engineering assessment of Minnesota's electricity
resource needs through 2025, with a focus on baseload resources. The reliability administrator
may contract with an independent entity to conduct all or part of the study. The assessment
must consider additional generation and transmission resources necessary to meet the state's
5956                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [74TH DAY

renewable energy standard under Laws 2007, chapter 3, section 1, subdivision 2a, and projected
energy savings resulting from the implementation of article 2. The assessment, among other
activities, must review and evaluate the most recent Minnesota utility demand forecasts, integrated
resource plans filed under section 216B.2422, and transmission projects reports filed under section
216B.2425, including the assumptions underlying them, and provide independent projections of
demand and baseload and nonbaseload generation and transmission resources available to meet
projected demand in 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025. The reliability administrator shall manage the
assessment process and shall appoint a technical review committee to review the assessment's
proposed methods, assumptions, and preliminary data and results. The reliability administrator
must submit a report on the assessment to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate
and house of representatives committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy. The cost of
the assessment is recoverable under section 216C.052, subdivision 2.
   Sec. 17. STATEWIDE STUDY OF DISPERSED GENERATION POTENTIAL.
    Subdivision 1. Definition. "Dispersed generation" means an electric generation project with a
generating capacity between ten and 40 megawatts that utilizes an "eligible energy technology," as
defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 216B.1691, subdivision 1, paragraph (a).
    Subd. 2. Study participants. Each electric utility subject to Minnesota Statutes, section
216B.1691, must participate collaboratively in conducting a two-phase study of the potential for
dispersed generation projects that can be developed in Minnesota.
    Subd. 3. First phase study content; report. In the first phase of the study, participants must
analyze the impacts of the addition of a total of 600 megawatts of new dispersed generation
projects distributed among the following Minnesota electric transmission planning zones: the
Northeast zone, the Northwest zone, the Southeast zone, the Southwest zone, and the West-Central
zone. Study participants must use a generally accepted 2010 year transmission system model
including all transmission facilities expected to be operating in 2010. The study must take into
consideration regional projected load growth, planned changes in the bulk transmission network,
and the long-range transmission conceptual plan being developed under Laws 2007, chapter 3,
section 2. In determining locations for the installation of dispersed generation projects that consist
of wind energy conversion systems, the study should consider, at a minimum, wind resource
availability, existing and contracted wind projects, and current dispersed generation projects in
the Midwest Independent System Operator interconnection queue. The study must analyze the
impacts of individual projects and all projects in aggregate on the transmission system, and identify
specific modifications to the transmission system necessary to remedy any problems caused by the
installation of dispersed generation projects, including cost estimates for the modifications. The
study must analyze the additional dispersed generation projects connected at the lowest voltage
level transmission that exists in the vicinity of the projected generation sites. A preliminary analysis
to identify transmission system problems must be conducted with the projects installed at initially
selected locations. The technical review committee may, after reviewing the locations selected for
installation, recommend moving the installation sites once to new locations to reduce undesirable
transmission system impacts. The commissioner of commerce must submit a report containing the
findings and recommendations of the first phase of the study to the commission no later than June
15, 2008.
  Subd. 4. Second phase study content; report. In the second phase of the study, participants
must analyze the impacts of an additional total of 600 megawatts of dispersed generation projects
74TH DAY]                            SUNDAY, MAY 20, 2007                                       5957

installed among the five transmission planning zones, or a higher total capacity amount if agreed
to by both the utilities and the technical review committee. The utilities must employ an analysis
method similar to that used in the first phase of the study, and must use the most recent information
available, including information developed in the first phase. The second phase of the study must
use a generally accepted 2013 year transmission system model including all transmission facilities
that are expected to be in service at that time. The commissioner of commerce must submit a report
containing the findings and recommendations of the second phase of the study to the commission
no later than September 15, 2009.
    Subd. 5. Technical review committee. Prior to the start of the first phase of the study, the
commissioner of commerce must appoint a technical review committee consisting of between
ten and 15 individuals with experience and expertise in electric transmission system engineering,
renewable energy generation technology, and dispersed generation project development, including
representatives from the federal Department of Energy, the Midwest Independent System Operator,
and stakeholder interests. The technical review committee must oversee both phases of the study,
and must:
   (1) make recommendations to the utilities regarding the proposed methods and assumptions to
be used in the technical study;
    (2) in conjunction with the appropriate utilities, hold public meetings on each phase of the study
in each electricity transmission planning zone prior to the beginning of each phase of study, after
the impact analysis is completed, and when a draft final report is available;
   (3) establish procedures for handling commercially sensitive information; and
    (4) review the initial and final drafts of the study and make recommendations for improvement,
including problems associated with the interconnections among utility systems that may be
amenable to solution through cooperation between the utilities in each zone. During each phase
of the study, the technical review committee may recommend that the installation of dispersed
generation projects be moved to new locations that cause fewer undesirable transmission system
impacts.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 18. WIND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY AGREEMENTS; STUDY.
    The Legislative Electric Energy Task Force shall study whether the state should regulate
easements, leases, and other agreements to acquire an interest in real property for the purpose of
wind energy development. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the duration and other
terms of those interests should be limited to promote wind energy development. The task force
must report the results of its study and any recommendations to the chairs of the energy finance
and policy committees of the legislature by February 1, 2008.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 19. C-BED ADVISORY TASK FORCE.
    Subdivision 1. Members. The Legislative Electric Energy Task Force shall oversee and appoint
an advisory task force on community-based energy development (C-BED) under Minnesota
Statutes, section 15.059, subdivision 6, consisting of representatives of the Department of
5958                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [74TH DAY

Commerce, the Public Utilities Commission, public utilities, independent power producers,

   (10) types of incentives, compensation, and encouragement for utility participation; and
   (11) other topics related to and impacting the C-BED program, as determined by the task force.
   Subd. 3. Expiration. This section, and the advisory task force on community-based energy
development, expires January 16, 2008.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 20. TRANSFERRING RELIABILITY ADMINISTRATOR RESPONSIBILITIES.
    All responsibilities, as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 15.039, subdivision 1, held by
the Public Utilities Commission relating to the reliability administrator under Minnesota Statutes,
section 216C.052, are transferred to the Minnesota Department of Commerce under Minnesota
Statutes, section 15.039.
   Sec. 21. TRANSMISSION AUTHORITY AND INTERCONNECTION EVALUATIONS.
   The reliability administrator shall, in consultation with interested stakeholders:
    (1) review the structures, powers, and duties for constructing, owning, maintaining, and
operating transmission facilities of state transmission authorities established in Kansas, North
Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, and evaluate whether the existence of a similar organization
in Minnesota would have the potential to increase the reliability and efficiency of the electrical grid
in the state; hasten the development of needed transmission lines; accelerate the development of
renewable energy projects, especially in rural areas of the state; and reduce delivered energy costs
to Minnesota ratepayers; and
74TH DAY]                           SUNDAY, MAY 20, 2007                                       5959

    (2) assess the potential for and barriers to interconnecting dispersed generation projects to
locations on the electric grid where a generator interconnection would not be subject to the
interconnection rules of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Midwest Independent
System Operator.
No technical or engineering analyses are necessary in order to complete these duties. The reliability
administrator must report its findings and any recommendations to the chairs of the senate and house
of representatives committees with jurisdiction over energy policy by February 15, 2008.
                                           ARTICLE 5
            GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE; GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
   Section 1. [216H.01] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Scope. For the purpose of this chapter, the terms defined in this section have the
meanings given them.
    Subd. 2. Statewide greenhouse gas emissions. "Statewide greenhouse gas emissions" include
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and
sulfur hexafluoride emitted by anthropogenic sources within the state and from the generation of
electricity imported from outside the state and consumed in Minnesota. Carbon dioxide that is
injected into geological formations to prevent its release to the atmosphere in compliance with
applicable laws, and carbon dioxide associated with the combustion of fuels other than coal,
petroleum, and natural gas are not counted as contributing to statewide greenhouse gas emissions.
   Sec. 2. [216H.02] GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONTROL.
    Subdivision 1. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal. It is the goal of the state to reduce
statewide greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors producing those emissions to a level at least
15 percent below 2005 levels by 2015, to a level at least 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, and
to a level at least 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. The levels shall be reviewed based on the
climate change action plan study.
    Subd. 2. Climate change action plan. By February 1, 2008, the commissioner of commerce, in
consultation with the commissioners of the Pollution Control Agency, the Housing Finance Agency,
and the Departments of Natural Resources, Agriculture, Employment and Economic Development,
and Transportation, and the chair of the Metropolitan Council, shall submit to the legislature a
climate change action plan that meets the requirements of this section.
    Subd. 3. Stakeholder process. The plan required by subdivision 2 must be developed through
a structured, broadly inclusive stakeholder-based review of potential policies and initiatives that
will reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions from a broad range of sources and activities.
The commissioner shall engage a nationally recognized independent expert entity to conduct
the stakeholder process. The report of the stakeholder process must form the basis for the plan
submitted by the commissioner under subdivision 2.
   Subd. 4. General elements of the plan. The plan must:
   (1) estimate 1990 and 2005 greenhouse gas emissions in the state and make projections of
emissions in 2015, 2025, and 2050;
5960                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [74TH DAY

    (2) identify, evaluate, and integrate a broad range of statewide greenhouse gas reduction options
for all emission sectors in the state;
   (3) assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of implementing the options;
    (4) recommend an integrated set of reduction options and strategies for implementing the options
that will achieve the goals in subdivision 1, including analysis of the associated costs and benefits
to Minnesotans;
    (5) estimate the statewide greenhouse gas emissions reductions anticipated from implementation
of existing state policies;
   (6) recommend a system to require the reporting of statewide greenhouse gas emissions,
identifying which facilities must report, and how emission estimates should be made; and
   (7) evaluate the option of exempting a project from the prohibitions contained in section
216H.03, subdivision 3, if the project contributes a specified fee per ton of carbon dioxide
emissions emitted annually by the project, the proceeds of which would be used to fund permanent,
quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would not
otherwise have occurred.
    Subd. 5. Specific plan requirements. (a) The plan must evaluate and recommend interim goals
as steps to achieve the goals in subdivision 1.
    (b) The plan must determine the feasibility, assess the costs and benefits, and recommend how
the state could adopt a regulatory system that imposes a cap on the aggregate air pollutant emissions
of a group of sources, requires those subject to the cap to own an allowance for each ton of the air
pollutant emitted, and allows for market-based trading of those allowances. The evaluation must
contain an analysis of the state implementing a cap and trade system alone, in coordination with
other states, and as a requirement of federal law applying to all states. The plan must recommend
the parameters of a cap and trade system that includes a cap that would prevent significant increases
in greenhouse gas emissions above current levels with a schedule for lowering the cap periodically
to achieve the goals in subdivision 1 and interim goals recommended under paragraph (a). The plan
must consider cost savings and cost increases on energy consumers in the state.
    (c) The plan must include recommendations for improvements in the emissions inventory and
recommend whether the state should require greenhouse gas emissions reporting from specific
sources and, if so, which sources should be required to report. The plan must also evaluate options
for an emissions registry after reviewing registries in other states and recommend a registry that
will insure the greatest opportunity for Minnesota entities to obtain marketable credits.
    Subd. 6. Regional activities. The state must, to the extent possible, with other states in
the Midwest region, develop and implement a regional approach to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions from activities in the region, including consulting on a regional cap and trade system.
The commissioner of commerce shall coordinate Minnesota's regional activities under this
subdivision and report to the legislative committees in the senate and house of representatives with
jurisdiction over energy and environmental policy by February 1, 2008, and February 1, 2009, on
the progress made and recommendations for further action. The commissioner of commerce, as
part of the activities required under this subdivision, must meet with responsible officials from
bordering states, other states in the Midwest region, and states in other regions of the country to:
74TH DAY]                             SUNDAY, MAY 20, 2007                                         5961

(1) determine whether other states are interested in establishing and cooperating in a multistate or
regional greenhouse gas cap and trade allowance program; (2) identify and prepare an inventory of
greenhouse gas reduction resources available to support a multistate or regional greenhouse gas
cap and trade allowance program; (3) seek cooperation on a regional inventory of greenhouse gas
emission sources; and (4) prepare an inventory of available renewable energy resources within a
state or region. The commissioner of commerce must develop a definition of scope of this regional
activity that is in addition to the components described in clauses (1) to (4). The commissioner
must report on the additional scoping definitions to the chairs and ranking minority members of
the legislative committees with jurisdiction over energy and environmental finance and policy on
or before the commencement of the 2008 regular legislative session.
   Sec. 3. [216H.03] FAILURE TO ADOPT GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL PLAN.
    Subdivision 1. Definition; new large energy facility. For the purpose of this section, "new
large energy facility" means a large energy facility, as defined in section 216B.2421, subdivision 2,
clause (1), that is not in operation as of January 1, 2007, but does not include a facility that (1) uses
natural gas as a primary fuel, (2) is designed to provide peaking, intermediate, emergency backup,
or contingency services, (3) uses a simple cycle or combined cycle turbine technology, and (4) is
capable of achieving full load operations within 45 minutes of startup for a simple cycle facility,
or is capable of achieving minimum load operations within 185 minutes of startup for a combined
cycle facility.
    Subd. 2. Definition; statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions. For the purpose of
this section, "statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions" means the total annual emissions of
carbon dioxide from the generation of electricity within the state and all emissions of carbon dioxide
from the generation of electricity imported from outside the state and consumed in Minnesota.
Emissions of carbon dioxide associated with transmission and distribution line losses are included
in this definition. Carbon dioxide that is injected into geological formations to prevent its release to
the atmosphere in compliance with applicable laws, and emissions of carbon dioxide associated with
the combustion of biomass, as defined in section 216B.2411, subdivision 2, paragraph (c), clauses
(1) to (4), are not counted as contributing to statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions.
    Subd. 3. Long-term increased emissions from power plants prohibited. Unless preempted
by federal law, until a comprehensive and enforceable state law or rule pertaining to greenhouse
gases that directly limits and substantially reduces, over time, statewide power sector carbon dioxide
emissions is enacted and in effect, and except as allowed in subdivisions 4 to 7, on and after August
1, 2009, no person shall:
    (1) construct within the state a new large energy facility that would contribute to statewide power
sector carbon dioxide emissions;
    (2) import or commit to import from outside the state power from a new large energy facility
that would contribute to statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions; or
    (3) enter into a new long-term power purchase agreement that would increase statewide power
sector carbon dioxide emissions. For purposes of this section, a long-term power purchase agreement
means an agreement to purchase 50 megawatts of capacity or more for a term exceeding five years.
   Subd. 4. Exception for facilities that offset emissions. (a) The prohibitions in subdivision 3
do not apply if the project proponent demonstrates to the Public Utilities Commission's satisfaction
5962                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [74TH DAY

that it will offset the new contribution to statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions with a
carbon dioxide reduction project identified in paragraph (b) and in compliance with paragraph (c).
    (b) A project proponent may offset in an amount equal to or greater than the proposed new
contribution to statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions in either, or a combination of both,
of the following ways:
   (1) by reducing an existing facility's contribution to statewide power sector carbon dioxide
emissions; or
   (2) by purchasing carbon dioxide allowances from a state or group of states that has a carbon
dioxide cap and trade system in place that produces verifiable emissions reductions.
   (c) The Public Utilities Commission shall not find that a proposed carbon dioxide reduction
project identified in paragraph (b) acceptably offsets a new contribution to statewide power sector
carbon dioxide emissions unless the proposed offsets are permanent, quantifiable, verifiable,
enforceable, and would not have otherwise occurred. This section does not exempt emissions that
have been offset under this subdivision and emissions exempted under subdivisions 5 to 7 from a
cap and trade system if adopted by the state.
    Subd. 5. Exception for new steel production facility. The prohibitions in subdivision 3 do not
apply to increases in statewide power sector carbon dioxide emissions from a new steel production
project located in a taconite relief area that has filed an application for an air quality permit from
the Pollution Control Agency prior to January 1, 2007.
    Subd. 6. Exception for iron nugget production facility. The prohibitions in subdivision 3 do
not apply to an iron nugget production facility that began construction prior to January 31, 2007, nor
to associated mining activities and beneficiation facilities with a concentrate capacity of up to three
million tons annually. For the purposes of this subdivision, "iron nugget" means a product with at
least 90 percent iron content.
   Subd. 7. Other exemptions. The prohibitions in subdivision 3 do not apply to:
    (1) a new large energy facility under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant
to proposals or applications filed with the Public Utilities Commission before April 1, 2007, or to
any power purchase agreement related to a facility described in this clause. The exclusion of pending
proposals and applications from the prohibitions in subdivision 3 does not limit the applicability of
any other law and is not an expression of legislative intent regarding whether any pending proposal
or application should be approved or denied;
    (2) a contract not subject to commission approval that was entered into prior to April 1, 2007,
to purchase power from a new large energy facility that was approved by a comparable authority in
another state prior to that date, for which municipal or public power district bonds have been issued,
and on which construction has begun; or
    (3) a new large energy facility or a power purchase agreement between a Minnesota utility and
a new large energy facility located outside Minnesota that the Public Utilities Commission has
determined is essential to ensure the long-term reliability of Minnesota's electric system, to allow

    Subd. 8. Enforcement. Whenever the commission or the Department of Commerce determines
that any person is violating or about to violate this section, it may refer the matter to the attorney
general who shall take appropriate legal action. This section may be enforced by the attorney general
on the same basis as a law listed in section 8.31, subdivision 1, except that the remedies provided

  Sec. 4. [216H.06] GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONSIDERATION IN RESOURCE
PLANNING.
    By January 1, 2008, the Public Utilities Commission shall establish an estimate of the likely
range of costs of future carbon dioxide regulation on electricity generation. The estimate, which
may be made in a commission order, must be used in all electricity generation resource acquisition
proceedings. The estimates, and annual updates, must be made following informal proceedings
conducted by the commissioners of commerce and pollution control that allow interested parties
to submit comments.

                             RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.1691, subdivision 5, as amended by Laws
2007, chapter 3, section 1, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Technology based on fuel combustion. (a) Electricity produced by fuel combustion
through fuel blending or co-firing under paragraph (b) may only count toward a utility's objectives
or standards if the generation facility:
    (1) was constructed in compliance with new source performance standards promulgated under
the federal Clean Air Act for a generation facility of that type; or
   (2) employs the maximum achievable or best available control technology available for a
generation facility of that type.
    (b) An eligible energy technology may blend or co-fire a fuel listed in subdivision 1, paragraph
(a), clause ­(1
              ­­
               ) (5), with other fuels in the generation facility, but only the percentage of electricity
that is attributable to a fuel listed in that clause can be counted toward an electric utility's renewable
energy objectives.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.1691, subdivision 7, as added by Laws 2007,
chapter 3, section 1, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Compliance. The commission must regularly investigate whether an electric utility
is in compliance with its good-faith objective under subdivision 2 and standard obligation under
subdivision 2a. If the commission finds noncompliance, it may order the electric utility to construct
facilities, purchase energy generated by eligible energy technology, purchase renewable energy
credits, or engage in other activities to achieve compliance. If an electric utility fails to comply
with an order under this subdivision, the commission may impose a financial penalty on the electric
utility in an amount not to exceed the estimated cost of the electric utility to achieve compliance.
The penalty may not exceed the lesser of the cost of constructing facilities or purchasing credits.
