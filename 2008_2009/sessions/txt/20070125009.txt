                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Tim Pawlenty, Governor

   Page 1, delete lines 4 to 21
   Page 2, delete lines 1 to 17 and insert:
    "WHEREAS, the Great Lakes are a tremendous value to Minnesota as an environmental and
economic resource, both as the world's largest body of fresh water and as a crucial international
shipping channel; and
    WHEREAS, aquatic invasive species, including the recent introduction of the fish killing
VHS virus, have caused significant damage to native environments and industrial operations
in the Great Lakes and around the world; and
   WHEREAS, Minnesota's Lake Superior ports provide Minnesota farmers, miners, and
manufacturers with access to foreign markets through the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence Seaway,
with nearly 41.7 million metric tons of maritime cargo through the Port of Duluth-Superior in
exchange for approximately 35.4 million metric tons of untreated ballast water in 2005; and
    WHEREAS, current federal laws and enforcement governing the introduction of aquatic
invasive species into United States waters via ballast water of ocean-going and Great Lakes
ships and other sources are inadequate; and
    WHEREAS, because of the detrimental effects of imposing regional restrictions on an
international shipping channel, there is a need for uniform federal regulation and control; and
    WHEREAS, there is currently no nationally accepted standard for drinking and treated waste
ballast water quality nor any approved ballast treatment technologies available to ship operators;
NOW, THEREFORE,
9TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, JANUARY 25, 2007                                      117

   BE IT RESOLVED by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota:
    That the Minnesota Legislature has a great concern for the protection of its environmental and
economic resources now imminently threatened by the VHS fish killing viruses invading Lake
St.Clair, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario;
    That the Minnesota Legislature urges the United States Congress to acknowledge the national
urgency of this problem and move quickly to enact federal legislation to establish a strong ballast
water regulatory program sufficient to prohibit further VHS virus infestations and prevent future
introduction of aquatic invasive species into all United States waters by requiring disinfection
and sterilization of all ballast water;
    That the Minnesota Legislature declares its support for the efforts of the United States federal
agencies, including the United States Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Coast Guard, Canadian
government agencies, and the International Maritime Organization to put in place an international
ballast water treatment and regulatory program for the Great Lakes and connecting channels; and
    That the Minnesota Legislature declares its support for a revised "Great Ships Initiative,"
applicable to Great Lakes monitoring and enforcement of aquatic invasive species prohibition
and prevention efforts, a research and development project funded jointly by the Indiana Port
Commission and other Great Lakes ports, the U. S. Department of Transportation, the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and other federal agencies with the revised goals of accelerating and
improving existing applicable disinfection technology and the development of monitoring methods
for disease and other invasive organisms and availability of ballast water treatment technology.
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota is directed
to prepare copies of this memorial and transmit them to the President of the United States, the
President and the Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, Minnesota's Senators and Representatives in Congress, federal
agencies that regulate maritime transportation, the Great Lakes Commission, and the International
Joint Commission, United States-Canada."
  And when so amended the resolution do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Rules and
Administration. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.
