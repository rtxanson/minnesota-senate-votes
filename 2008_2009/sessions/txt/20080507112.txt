    Senator Betzold, designee of the Chair of the Committee on Rules and Administration, moved
that H.F. No. 3149 be laid on the table. The motion prevailed.

                                 REPORTS OF COMMITTEES

   Senator Betzold moved that the Committee Reports at the Desk be now adopted. The motion
prevailed.


    Senator Pogemiller, from the Committee on Rules and Administration, to which was
referred
   H.F. No. 3955 for comparison with companion Senate File, reports the following House File
was found not identical with companion Senate File as follows:
     GENERAL ORDERS                    CONSENT CALENDAR                         CALENDAR
   H.F. No.         S.F. No.           H.F. No.         S.F. No.           H.F. No.       S.F. No.
    3955             3673

   Pursuant to Rule 45, the Committee on Rules and Administration recommends that H.F. No.
3955 be amended as follows:
    Delete all the language after the enacting clause of H.F. No. 3955, the third engrossment; and
insert the language after the enacting clause of S.F. No. 3673, the second engrossment; further, delete
the title of H.F. No. 3955, the third engrossment; and insert the title of S.F. No. 3673, the second
engrossment.
    And when so amended H.F. No. 3955 will be identical to S.F. No. 3673, and further recommends
that H.F. No. 3955 be given its second reading and substituted for S.F. No. 3673, and that the Senate
File be indefinitely postponed.
   Pursuant to Rule 45, this report was prepared and submitted by the Secretary of the Senate on
behalf of the Committee on Rules and Administration. Amendments adopted. Report adopted.

   Senator Cohen from the Committee on Finance, to which was re-referred

112TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 2008                                        9591

   Subd. 24a. Managed care plans. Data provided to the commissioner of human services by
managed care plans relating to contracts and provider payment rates are classified under section
256B.69, subdivisions 9a and 9b.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Managed care contracts. (a) Managed care contracts under this section and sections
256L.12 and 256D.03, shall be entered into or renewed on a calendar year basis beginning January
1, 1996. Managed care contracts which were in effect on June 30, 1995, and set to renew on July 1,
1995, shall be renewed for the period July 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995 at the same terms that
were in effect on June 30, 1995. The commissioner may issue separate contracts with requirements
specific to services to medical assistance recipients age 65 and older.
    (b) A prepaid health plan providing covered health services for eligible persons pursuant to
chapters 256B, 256D, and 256L, is responsible for complying with the terms of its contract with
the commissioner. Requirements applicable to managed care programs under chapters 256B, 256D,
and 256L, established after the effective date of a contract with the commissioner take effect when
the contract is next issued or renewed.
    (c) Effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, the commissioner shall withhold
five percent of managed care plan payments under this section for the prepaid medical assistance
and general assistance medical care programs pending completion of performance targets. Each
performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably attainable, except
in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule. Criteria for assessment of
each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract effective date. The managed
care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that the data submitted regarding
attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner shall periodically change the
administrative measures used as performance targets in order to improve plan performance across a
broader range of administrative services. The performance targets must include measurement of plan
efforts to contain spending on health care services and administrative activities. The commissioner
may adopt plan-specific performance targets that take into account factors affecting only one plan,
including characteristics of the plan's enrollee population. The withheld funds must be returned
no sooner than July of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. The
commissioner may exclude special demonstration projects under subdivision 23. A managed care
plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include as admitted assets
under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph that is reasonably expected to be
returned.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5i. Administrative expenses. (a) Managed care plan and county-based purchasing plan
administrative costs for a prepaid health plan provided under this section or section 256B.692 must
not exceed by more than five percent that prepaid health plan's or county-based purchasing plan's
actual calculated administrative spending for the previous calendar year as a percentage of total
revenue. The penalty for exceeding this limit must be the amount of administrative spending in
excess of 105 percent of the actual calculated amount. The commissioner may waive this penalty if
the excess administrative spending is the result of unexpected shifts in enrollment or member needs
or new program requirements.
   (b) Expenses listed under section 62D.12, subdivision 9a, clause (4), are not allowable
9592                                   JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                       [112TH DAY

administrative expenses for rate-setting purposes under this section, unless approved by the
commissioner.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5j. Treatment of investment earnings. Capitation rates shall treat investment income
and interest earnings as income to the same extent that investment-related expenses are treated as
administrative expenditures.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9a. Administrative expense reporting. The commissioner shall work with the
commissioner of health to identify and collect data on administrative spending for state health
care programs reported to the commissioner of health by managed care plans under section
62D.08 and county-based purchasing plans under section 256B.692, provided that such data are
consistent with guidelines and standards for administrative spending that are developed by the
commissioner of health, and reported to the legislature under section 12 of this act. Data provided
to the commissioner under this subdivision are nonpublic data as defined under section 13.02.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9b. Reporting provider payment rates. (a) According to guidelines developed by the
commissioner, in consultation with managed care plans and county-based purchasing plans, each
managed care plan and county-based purchasing plan must provide to the commissioner, at the
commissioner's request, detailed or aggregate information on reimbursement rates paid by the
managed care plan under this section or the county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692
to provider types and vendors for administrative services under contract with the plan.
    (b) Data provided to the commissioner under this subdivision are nonpublic data as defined in
section 13.02.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2010.
    Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.692, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Duties of commissioner of health. (a) Notwithstanding chapters 62D and 62N, a
county that elects to purchase medical assistance and general assistance medical care in return for a
fixed sum without regard to the frequency or extent of services furnished to any particular enrollee
is not required to obtain a certificate of authority under chapter 62D or 62N. The county board
of commissioners is the governing body of a county-based purchasing program. In a multicounty
arrangement, the governing body is a joint powers board established under section 471.59.
    (b) A county that elects to purchase medical assistance and general assistance medical care
services under this section must satisfy the commissioner of health that the requirements for
assurance of consumer protection, provider protection, and, effective January 1, 2010, fiscal
solvency of chapter 62D, applicable to health maintenance organizations,                   ­­

The fees in clauses (2) and (3) are subject to the provisions of Minnesota Rules, part 4685.2800,
subpart 2. All fees collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state government special
revenue fund.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.692, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4a. Expenditure of revenues. (a) A county that has elected to participate in a county-based
purchasing plan under this section shall use any excess revenues over expenses that are received by
the county and are not needed (1) for capital reserves under subdivision 2, (2) to increase payments
to providers, or (3) to repay county investments or contributions to the county-based purchasing
plan, for prevention, early intervention, and health care programs, services, or activities.
   (b) A county-based purchasing plan under this section is subject to the unreasonable expense
provisions of section 62D.19.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.12, subdivision 9, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9. Rate setting; performance withholds. (a) Rates will be prospective, per capita, where
possible. The commissioner may allow health plans to arrange for inpatient hospital services on
a risk or nonrisk basis. The commissioner shall consult with an independent actuary to determine
appropriate rates.
    (b) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, the commissioner
shall withhold .5 percent of managed care plan payments under this section pending completion
of performance targets. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later
than July 31 of the following year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. A managed
care plan may include as admitted assets under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this
paragraph that is reasonably expected to be returned.
    (c) For services rendered on or after January 1, 2004, the commissioner shall withhold five
percent of managed care plan payments under this section pending completion of performance
targets. Each performance target must be quantifiable, objective, measurable, and reasonably
attainable, except in the case of a performance target based on a federal or state law or rule.
Criteria for assessment of each performance target must be outlined in writing prior to the contract
effective date. The managed care plan must demonstrate, to the commissioner's satisfaction, that
the data submitted regarding attainment of the performance target is accurate. The commissioner
shall periodically change the administrative measures used as performance targets in order to
improve plan performance across a broader range of administrative services. The performance
targets must include measurement of plan efforts to contain spending on health care services and
administrative activities. The commissioner may adopt plan-specific performance targets that
take into account factors affecting only one plan, such as characteristics of the plan's enrollee
population. The withheld funds must be returned no sooner than July 1 and no later than July 31
of the following calendar year if performance targets in the contract are achieved. A managed care
plan or a county-based purchasing plan under section 256B.692 may include as admitted assets
under section 62D.044 any amount withheld under this paragraph that is reasonably expected to
be returned.

shall continue to use single-health plan, county-based purchasing arrangements for medical
assistance and general assistance medical care programs and products for the counties that were in
single-health plan, county-based purchasing arrangements on March 1, 2008. This paragraph does
not require the commissioner to terminate an existing contract with a noncounty-based purchasing
plan that had enrollment in a medical assistance program or product in these counties on March 1,
2008. This paragraph expires on December 31, 2010, or the effective date of a new contract for
medical assistance and general assistance medical care managed care programs entered into at
the conclusion of the commissioner's next scheduled reprocurement process for the county-based
purchasing entities covered by this paragraph, whichever is later.
       (b) The commissioner shall consider, and may approve, contracting on a single-health plan
basis with other county-based purchasing plans, or with other qualified health plans that have
coordination arrangements with counties, to serve persons with a disability who voluntarily enroll,
in order to promote better coordination or integration of health care services, social services
and other community-based services, provided that all requirements applicable to health plan
purchasing, including those in Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, are satisfied.

health care program costs;
   (2) a description of and, to the extent possible, an explanation of recent differences between the
health plan net revenue targets established by the commissioner for health plans participating in
public health care programs and the actual net revenue realized by the plans from public programs;
    (3) the adequacy of public health care program for fee-for-service rates, including an

The guidelines shall not have the effect of changing allocation for Medicare-related programs as
permitted by federal law and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The report shall
include recommendations and cost estimates for developing detailed standards and procedures

duties of the ombudsman should be expanded to include advocating on behalf of public health care
program fee-for-service enrollees. The report must include:
   (1) a comparison of the recourse available to managed care clients versus fee-for-service clients
when service problems occur; and
   (2) an estimate of any net cost increase from this change in the ombudsman's duties, taking into
account any reduction in the commissioner's duties.
   Sec. 14. REPORTING MANAGED CARE PERFORMANCE DATA.
   The commissioner of human services, in cooperation with the commissioner of health, shall
report to the legislature under Minnesota Statutes, section 3.195, by January 15, 2009, with

    Subd. 4. Limitation of choice. (a) The commissioner shall develop criteria to determine when
limitation of choice may be implemented in the experimental counties. The criteria shall ensure that
all eligible individuals in the county have continuing access to the full range of medical assistance
services as specified in subdivision 6.
   (b) The commissioner shall exempt the following persons from participation in the project, in
addition to those who do not meet the criteria for limitation of choice:
   (1) persons eligible for medical assistance according to section 256B.055, subdivision 1;
   (2) persons eligible for medical assistance due to blindness or disability as determined by the
Social Security Administration or the state medical review team, unless:
   (i) they are 65 years of age or older; or
    (ii) they reside in Itasca County or they reside in a county in which the commissioner conducts
a pilot project under a waiver granted pursuant to section 1115 of the Social Security Act;

persons enrolled in a non-Medicare individual health plan determined to be cost-effective according
to section 256B.0625, subdivision 15.
Children under age 21 who are in foster placement may enroll in the project on an elective basis.
Individuals excluded under clauses (1), (6), and (7) may choose to enroll on an elective basis. The
commissioner may enroll recipients in the prepaid medical assistance program for seniors who are
(1) age 65 and over, and (2) eligible for medical assistance by spending down excess income.
    (c) The commissioner may allow persons with a one-month spenddown who are otherwise
eligible to enroll to voluntarily enroll or remain enrolled, if they elect to prepay their monthly
spenddown to the state.
   (d) The commissioner may require those individuals to enroll in the prepaid medical assistance
program who otherwise would have been excluded under paragraph (b), clauses (1), (3), and (8),
and under Minnesota Rules, part 9500.1452, subpart 2, items H, K, and L.
    (e) Before limitation of choice is implemented, eligible individuals shall be notified and after
notification, shall be allowed to choose only among demonstration providers. The commissioner
may assign an individual with private coverage through a health maintenance organization, to the
same health maintenance organization for medical assistance coverage, if the health maintenance
organization is under contract for medical assistance in the individual's county of residence. After
initially choosing a provider, the recipient is allowed to change that choice only at specified times as
allowed by the commissioner. If a demonstration provider ends participation in the project for any
reason, a recipient enrolled with that provider must select a new provider but may change providers
without cause once more within the first 60 days after enrollment with the second provider.
    (f) An infant born to a woman who is eligible for and receiving medical assistance and who is
enrolled in the prepaid medical assistance program shall be retroactively enrolled to the month of
birth in the same managed care plan as the mother once the child is enrolled in medical assistance
unless the child is determined to be excluded from enrollment in a prepaid plan under this section.
    (g) For an eligible individual under the age of 65, in the absence of a specific managed care
plan choice by the individual, the commissioner shall assign the individual to the county-based
purchasing health plan in Olmsted, Winona, Houston, Fillmore, and Mower Counties, if the
individual resides in one of these counties. For an eligible individual over the age of 65, the
commissioner shall make this default assignment upon the county-based purchasing plan entering
into a contract with the commissioner to serve this population and receiving federal approval as
a special needs plan.
   Sec. 2. STATEMENT OF COSTS; APPROPRIATION.
    By June 1, 2009, the commissioner of human services shall submit to Olmsted County an
itemized statement of costs incurred by the Department of Human Services for necessary changes
to the department's computer system to implement new Minnesota Statutes, section 256B.69,
subdivision 4, paragraph (g), along with a bill for the amount of those costs, up to $18,000. By June
30, 2009, Olmsted County must remit to the commissioner the amount billed. The amount received
by the commissioner must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account and
is appropriated to the commissioner as reimbursement for the costs billed."

fund will be less than anticipated, and that the amount available for the remainder of the biennium
will be less than needed, the commissioner shall, with the approval of the governor, and after
consulting the Legislative Advisory Commission, transfer from the health care access fund to the
general fund the amount of the deficiency, but not more than the commissioner has determined,
on the basis of the most recent forecast of health care access fund revenues and expenditures, will
be the positive unrestricted balance in the health care access fund at the end of the biennium. The
funds transferred must be used exclusively to pay for the costs of health care programs financed
by the state of Minnesota.

Legislative Advisory Commission, reduce the amount in the budget reserve account as needed to
balance expenditures with revenue.

electricity, but does not include mixed municipal solid waste, as defined in section 115A.03, and
that:
    (1) is intentionally cultivated, harvested, and prepared for use, in whole or in part, as a fuel for
the generation of electricity;
   (2) when combusted, releases an amount of carbon dioxide that is less than or approximately
equal to the carbon dioxide absorbed by the biomass fuel during its growing cycle; and
   (3) is fired in a new or substantially retrofitted electric generating facility that is:
   (i) located within 400 miles of the site of the biomass production; and
   (ii) designed to use biomass to meet at least 75 percent of its fuel requirements.
    (b) The legislature finds that the negative environmental impacts within 400 miles of the
facility resulting from transporting and combusting the biomass are offset in that region by the
environmental benefits to air, soil, and water of the biomass production.
    (c) Among the biomass fuel sources that meet the requirements of paragraph (a), clauses (1) and
(2), are poplar, aspen, willow, switch grass, sorghum, alfalfa, cultivated prairie grass, and sustainably
managed woody biomass.
   (d) For the purpose of this section, "sustainably managed woody biomass" means:
    (1) brush, trees, and other biomass harvested from within designated utility, railroad, and road
rights-of-way;
  (2) upland and lowland brush harvested from lands incorporated into brushland habitat
management activities of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources;
   (3) upland and lowland brush harvested from lands managed in accordance with Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources "Best Management Practices for Managing Brushlands";
   (4) logging slash or waste wood that is created by harvest, by precommercial timber stand
improvement to meet silvicultural objectives, or by fire, disease, or insect control treatments,
and that is managed in compliance with the Minnesota Forest Resources Council's "Sustaining
Minnesota Forest Resources: Voluntary Site-Level Forest Management Guidelines for Landowners,
Loggers and Resource Managers" as modified by the requirement of this subdivision; and
    (5) trees or parts of trees that do not meet the utilization standards for pulpwood, posts, bolts,
or sawtimber as described in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry
Timber Sales Manual, 1998, as amended as of May 1, 2005, and the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources Timber Scaling Manual, 1981, as amended as of May 1, 2005, except as provided
in paragraph (a), clause (1), and this paragraph, clauses (1) to (3).
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.243, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9. Renewable energy standard facilities. The requirements of this section do not
apply to a wind energy conversion system or a solar electric generation facility that is intended to
be used to meet or exceed the obligations of section 216B.1691; provided that, after notice and
comment, the commission determines that the facility is a reasonable and prudent approach to

meeting a utility's obligations under that section. When making this determination, the commission
may consider the size of the facility relative to a utility's total need for renewable resources and
alternative approaches for supplying the renewable energy to be supplied by the proposed facility,
and must consider the facility's ability to promote economic development, as required under section
216B.1691, subdivision 9, maintain electric system reliability and consider impacts on ratepayers,
and other criteria as the commission may determine are relevant.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

      Subd. 2. Like any conveyance. Any property owner may grant a solar or wind easement in the
same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in real property. The easements
shall be created in writing and shall be filed, duly recorded, and indexed in the office of the recorder
of the county in which the easement is granted. No duly recorded easement shall be unenforceable
on account of lack of privity of estate or privity of contract; such easements shall run with the land
or lands benefited and burdened and shall constitute a perpetual easement, except that an easement
may terminate upon the conditions stated therein or pursuant to the provisions of section 500.20. A                                                    ­

subdivision to read:
  Subd. 3. Standards for state-funded outdoor lighting fixtures. (a) An outdoor lighting fixture
may be installed or replaced using state funds only if:
    (1) the new or replacement outdoor lighting fixture is a cutoff luminaire if the rated output of
the outdoor lighting fixture is greater than 1,800 lumens;
    (2) the minimum illuminance adequate for the intended purpose is used with consideration given
to nationally recognized standards;
    (3) for lighting of a designated highway of the state highway system, the Department of
Transportation determines that the purpose of the outdoor lighting fixture cannot be achieved by
the installation of reflective road markers, lines, warning or informational signs, or other effective
passive methods; and
   (4) full consideration has been given to energy conservation and savings, reducing glare,
minimizing light pollution, and preserving the natural night environment.
   (b) Paragraph (a) does not apply if:
   (1) a federal law, rule, or regulation preempts state law;
   (2) the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis because emergency personnel require
additional illumination for emergency procedures;

   (3) the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis for nighttime work;
    (4) special events or situations require additional illumination, provided that the illumination
installed shields the outdoor lighting fixtures from direct view and minimizes upward lighting and
light pollution;
    (5) the outdoor lighting fixture is used solely to highlight the aesthetic aspects of a single object
or distinctive building; or
   (6) a compelling safety interest exists that cannot be addressed by another method.
   (c) This subdivision does not apply to the operation and maintenance of lights or lighting systems
purchased or installed, or for which design work is completed, before August 1, 2008.
   (d) This section does not apply if a state agency or local unit of government determines that
compliance with this section would:
   (1) require an increased use of electricity;
   (2) increase the construction cost of a lighting system more than 15 percent over the construction
cost of a lighting system that does not comply with this section;
    (3) increase the cost of operation and maintenance of the lighting system more than ten percent
over the cost of operating and maintaining the existing lighting system over the life of the lighting
system; or
   (4) result in a negative safety impact."

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 18B.065, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Cooperative agreements. The commissioner may enter into cooperative agreements
with state agencies and local units of government for administration of the waste pesticide
collection program. The commissioner shall ensure that the program is carried out in all counties.
If the commissioner cannot contract with another party to administer the program in a county, the
commissioner shall perform collections according to the provisions of this section.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 18B.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Prohibited pesticide use. (a) A person may not use, store, handle, distribute, or dispose
of a pesticide, rinsate, pesticide container, or pesticide application equipment in a manner:
   (1) that is inconsistent with a label or labeling as defined by FIFRA;
   (2) that endangers humans, damages agricultural products, food, livestock, fish, or wildlife; or
   (3) that will cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
   (b) A person may not direct a pesticide onto property beyond the boundaries of the target site.
A person may not apply a pesticide resulting in damage to adjacent property.
   (c) A person may not directly apply a pesticide on a human by overspray or target site spray,
except when:
   (1) the pesticide is intended for use on a human;
   (2) the pesticide application is for mosquito control operations;
   (3) the pesticide application is for control of gypsy moth, forest tent caterpillar, or other pest
species, as determined by the commissioner, and the pesticide used is a biological agent; or
    (4) the pesticide application is for a public health risk, as determined by the commissioner
of health, and the commissioner of health, in consultation with the commissioner of agriculture,
determines that the application is warranted based on the commissioner's balancing of the public
health risk with the risk that the pesticide application poses to the health of the general population,
with special attention to the health of children.
   (d) For pesticide applications under paragraph (c), clause (2), the following conditions apply:
   (1) no practicable and effective alternative method of control exists;
   (2) the pesticide is among the least toxic available for control of the target pest; and
    (3) notification to residents in the area to be treated is provided at least 24 hours before
application through direct notification, posting daily on the treating organization's Web site, if
any, and by sending a broadcast e-mail to those persons who request notification of such, of those
areas to be treated by adult mosquito control techniques during the next calendar day. For control
operations related to human disease, notice under this paragraph may be given less than 24 hours
in advance.
   (e) For pesticide applications under paragraph (c), clauses (3) and (4), the following conditions
apply:

     (1) no practicable and effective alternative method of control exists;
     (2) the pesticide is among the least toxic available for control of the target pest; and
   (3) notification of residents in the area to be treated is provided by direct notification and through
publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the affected area.
    (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "direct notification" may include mailings, public meetings,
posted placards, neighborhood newsletters, or other means of contact designed to reach as many
residents as possible. Public meetings held to meet this requirement for adult mosquito control,
under paragraph (d), must be held within each city or town where the pesticide treatments are to be
made, at a time and location that is convenient for residents of the area where the treatments will
occur.
    (g) A person may not apply a pesticide in a manner so as to expose a worker in an immediately
adjacent, open field.
     (h) Notwithstanding that the application is done in a manner consistent with the label or labeling,
it is a violation of this chapter to directly apply a pesticide to a site where an application has not
been: (1) requested, ordered, contracted for, or permitted; or (2) performed pursuant to paragraph
(c), clause (2), (3), or (4).
     Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 18B.26, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Application fee. (a) A registrant shall pay an annual application fee for each pesticide
to be registered, and this fee is set at 0.4 percent of annual gross sales within the state and annual
gross sales of pesticides used in the state, with a minimum nonrefundable fee of $250. The registrant
shall determine when and which pesticides are sold or used in this state. The registrant shall secure
sufficient sales information of pesticides distributed into this state from distributors and dealers,
regardless of distributor location, to make a determination. Sales of pesticides in this state and sales
of pesticides for use in this state by out-of-state distributors are not exempt and must be included in
the registrant's annual report, as required under paragraph (c), and fees shall be paid by the registrant
based upon those reported sales. Sales of pesticides in the state for use outside of the state are exempt
from the application fee in this paragraph if the registrant properly documents the sale location and
distributors. A registrant paying more than the minimum fee shall pay the balance due by March
1 based on the gross sales of the pesticide by the registrant for the preceding calendar year. The
fee for disinfectants and sanitizers shall be the minimum. The minimum fee is due by December
31 preceding the year for which the application for registration is made. T                            ­h­­

fiscal year, the commissioner shall allocate from the pesticide regulatory account a sum sufficient
to collect and dispose of waste pesticides under section 18B.065. However, notwithstanding section
18B.065, if the commissioner determines that the balance in the pesticide regulatory account at the
end of the fiscal year will be less than $500,000, the commissioner may suspend waste pesticide
collections or provide partial payment to a person for waste pesticide collection. The commissioner
must notify as soon as possible and no later than August 1 a person under contract to collect waste
pesticides of an anticipated suspension or payment reduction.
    (b) An additional fee of $100 must be paid by the applicant for each pesticide to be registered if
the application is a renewal application that is submitted after December 31.

    (c) A registrant must annually report to the commissioner the amount and type of each registered
pesticide sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed in the state. The report shall be filed by
March 1 for the previous year's registration. The commissioner shall specify the form of the report
and require additional information deemed necessary to determine the amount and type of pesticides
annually distributed in the state. The information required shall include the brand name, amount,
and formulation of each pesticide sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed in the state, but
the information collected, if made public, shall be reported in a manner which does not identify a
specific brand name in the report.
    (d) A registrant who is required to pay more than the minimum fee for any pesticide under
paragraph (a) must pay a late fee penalty of $100 for each pesticide application fee paid after March
1 in the year for which the license is to be issued.

violations of this chapter.
    (b) The commissioner may refuse to accept an application for a registration, permit, license,
or certification, and may revoke or suspend a previously issued registration, permit, license, or
certification of a person from another state if that person has:
    (1) had a registration, permit, license, or certification denied, revoked, or suspended by another
state for an offense reasonably related to the requirements, qualifications, or duties of a registration,
permit, license, or certification issued under chapter 18B or 18C; or

domesticated animals.
    Subd. 1a. Tag or notice. A duly authorized agent of the commissioner who finds or has probable
cause to believe that any food, animal, or consumer commodity is adulterated or so misbranded as
to be dangerous or fraudulent, or is in violation of section 31.131 shall affix to such article or animal
a tag or other appropriate marking giving notice that such article or animal is, or is suspected of
being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not
to remove or dispose of such article or animal by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or
disposal is given by such agent or the court. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or dispose
of such detained or embargoed article or animal by sale or otherwise without such permission.
    Subd. 2. Action for condemnation. When an article or animal detained or embargoed under
subdivision 1 has been found by such agent to be adulterated, or misbranded, the agent shall petition
the district court in the county in which the article or animal is detained or embargoed for an order
and decree for the condemnation of such article or animal. Any such agent who has found that an
article or animal so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, shall remove the tag
or other marking.
    Subd. 3. Remedies. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article or animal is adulterated
or misbranded, such article or animal shall, after entry of the decree, be destroyed at the expense of
the claimant thereof, under the supervision of such agent, and all court costs and fees, and storage and

processing of the article or animal, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees,
and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond, conditioned that such article or animal
shall be so labeled or processed, has been executed, may by order direct that such article or animal
be delivered to claimant thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of an agent of
the commissioner. The expense of such supervision shall be paid by claimant. The article or animal
shall be returned to the claimant and the bond shall be discharged on the representation to the court
by the commissioner that the article or animal is no longer in violation and that the expenses of such
supervision have been paid.
    Subd. 4. Duties of commissioner. Whenever the commissioner or any of the commissioner's
authorized agents shall find in any room, building, vehicle of transportation or other structure, any
meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit, or other perishable articles of food which are unsound, or
contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to
health or otherwise unsafe, the same being hereby declared to be a nuisance, the commissioner, or
the commissioner's authorized agent, shall forthwith condemn or destroy the same, or in any other
manner render the same unsalable as human food, and no one shall have any cause of action against
the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agent on account of such action.

The commissioner shall provide notice to the public and to those with custody of the product in as
thorough a manner as is practical under the emergency circumstances.

   Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 41A.09, subdivision 3a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3a. Ethanol producer payments. (a) The commissioner shall make cash payments
to producers of ethanol located in the state that have begun production at a specific location by
June 30, 2000. For the purpose of this subdivision, an entity that holds a controlling interest in
more than one ethanol plant is considered a single producer. The amount of the payment for each
producer's annual production, except as provided in paragraph (c), is 20 cents per gallon for each
gallon of ethanol produced at a specific location on or before June 30, 2000, or ten years after the
start of production, whichever is later. Annually, within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year, an
ethanol producer receiving payments under this subdivision must file a disclosure statement on
a form provided by the commissioner. The initial disclosure statement must include a summary
description of the organization of the business structure of the claimant, a listing of the percentages
of ownership by any person or other entity with an ownership interest of five percent or greater,
and a copy of its annual audited financial statements, including the auditor's report and footnotes.
The disclosure statement must include information demonstrating what percentage of the entity
receiving payments under this section is owned by farmers or other entities eligible to farm or own
agricultural land in Minnesota under the provisions of section 500.24. Subsequent annual reports
must reflect noncumulative changes in ownership of ten percent or more of the entity. The report
need not disclose the identity of the persons or entities eligible to farm or own agricultural land with
ownership interests, individuals residing within 30 miles of the plant, or of any other entity with
less than ten percent ownership interest, but the claimant must retain information within its files
confirming the accuracy of the data provided. This data must be made available to the commissioner
upon request. Not later than the 15th day of February in each year the commissioner shall deliver
to the chairs of the standing committees of the senate and the house of representatives that deal
with agricultural policy and agricultural finance issues an annual report summarizing aggregated
data from plants receiving payments under this section during the preceding calendar year. Audited
financial statements and notes and disclosure statements submitted to the commissioner are
nonpublic data under section 13.02, subdivision 9. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 13
relating to nonpublic data, summaries of the submitted audited financial reports and notes and
disclosure statements will be contained in the report to the committee chairs and will be public data.
    (b) No payments shall be made for ethanol production that occurs after June 30, 2010. A producer
of ethanol shall not transfer the producer's eligibility for payments under this section to an ethanol
plant at a different location.
   (c) If the level of production at an ethanol plant increases due to an increase in the production
capacity of the plant, the payment under paragraph (a) applies to the additional increment of
9668                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [112TH DAY

production until ten years after the increased production began. Once a plant's production capacity
reaches 15,000,000 gallons per year, no additional increment will qualify for the payment.
   (d) Total payments under paragraphs (a) and (c) to a producer in a fiscal year may not exceed
$3,000,000.
    (e) By the last day of October, January, April, and July, each producer shall file a claim for
payment for ethanol production during the preceding three calendar months. A producer that files a
claim under this subdivision shall include a statement of the producer's total ethanol production in
Minnesota during the quarter covered by the claim. For each claim and statement of total ethanol
production filed under this subdivision, the volume of ethanol production must be examined by an
independent certified public accountant in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
   (f) Payments shall be made November 15, February 15, May 15, and August 15. A separate
payment shall be made for each claim filed. Except as provided in paragraph (g), the total quarterly
payment to a producer under this paragraph may not exceed $750,000.
    (g) Notwithstanding the quarterly payment limits of paragraph (f), the commissioner shall make
an additional payment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to ethanol producers for the lesser of:
(1) 20 cents per gallon of production in the fourth quarter of the year that is greater than 3,750,000
gallons; or (2) the total amount of payments lost during the first three quarters of the fiscal year due
to plant outages, repair, or major maintenance. Total payments to an ethanol producer in a fiscal
year, including any payment under this paragraph, must not exceed the total amount the producer
is eligible to receive based on the producer's approved production capacity. The provisions of this
paragraph apply only to production losses that occur in quarters beginning after December 31, 1999.
    (h) The commissioner shall reimburse ethanol producers for any deficiency in payments
during earlier quarters if the deficiency occurred because of unallotment or because appropriated
money was insufficient to make timely payments in the full amount provided in paragraph (a).
Notwithstanding the quarterly or annual payment limitations in this subdivision, the commissioner
shall begin making payments for earlier deficiencies in each fiscal year that appropriations for
ethanol payments exceed the amount required to make eligible scheduled payments. Payments for
earlier deficiencies must continue until the deficiencies for each producer are paid in full, except
the commissioner shall not make a deficiency payment to an entity that no longer produces ethanol
on a commercial scale at the location for which the entity qualified for producer payments, or to
an assignee of the entity.
    (i) The commissioner may make direct payments to producers of rural economic infrastructure
with any amount of the annual appropriation for ethanol producer payments and rural economic
infrastructure that is in excess of the amount required to make scheduled ethanol producer payments
and deficiency payments under paragraphs (a) to (h).

sufficient knowledge to use the drugs properly.
    (c) A veterinarian may issue a prescription or other veterinary authorization by oral or written
communication to the dispenser, or by computer connection. If the communication is oral, the
veterinarian must enter it into the patient's record. The dispenser must record the veterinarian's
prescription or other veterinary authorization within 72 hours.
    (d) A prescription or other veterinary authorization must include:
    (1) the name, address, and, if written, the signature of the prescriber;
    (2) the name and address of the client;
    (3) identification of the species for which the drug is prescribed or ordered;

     (4)                       May 1, 2015                  20 percent

    The minimum content levels in clauses (3) and (4) are effective during the months of April,
May, June, July, August, September, and October only. The minimum content for the remainder
of the year is five percent. However, if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution
control determine, after consultation with the biodiesel task force and other technical experts, that
an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard exists
for the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses that adequately addresses technical issues
associated with Minnesota's cold weather and publish a notice in the State Register to that effect,
the commissioners may allow the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses to be effective
year-round.
    (b) The minimum content levels in paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), become effective on
the date specified only if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control
publish notice in the State Register and provide written notice to the chairs of the house and senate
committees with jurisdiction over agriculture, commerce, and transportation policy and finance, at
least 270 days prior to the date of each scheduled increase, that all of the following conditions have
been met and the state is prepared to move to the next scheduled minimum content level:
    (1) an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard
exists for the next minimum diesel-biodiesel blend;
    (2) a sufficient supply of biodiesel is available and the amount of biodiesel produced in this state
from feedstock with at least 75 percent that is produced in the United States and Canada is equal to
at least 50 percent of anticipated demand at the next minimum content level;
   (3) adequate blending infrastructure and regulatory protocol are in place in order to promote
biodiesel quality and avoid any potential economic disruption; and
   (4) at least five percent of the amount of biodiesel necessary for that minimum content level will
be produced from a biological resource other than an agricultural resource traditionally grown or

raised in the state, including, but not limited to, algae cultivated for biofuels production, waste oils,
and tallow.
   The condition in clause (2) may be waived if the commissioner finds that, due to weather-related
conditions, the necessary feed stock is unavailable.
    The condition in clause (4) may be waived if the commissioners find that the use of these
nontraditional feedstocks would be uneconomic under market conditions existing at the time notice
is given under this paragraph.
    (c) The commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control must consult with the
biodiesel task force when assessing and certifying conditions in paragraph (b), and in general must
seek the guidance of the biodiesel task force regarding biodiesel labeling, enforcement, and other
related issues.
    (d) During a period of biodiesel fuel shortage or a problem with biodiesel quality that negatively
affects the availability of biodiesel fuel, the commissioner of commerce may temporarily suspend
the minimum content requirement in subdivision 2 until there is sufficient biodiesel fuel, as defined
in subdivision 1, available to fulfill the minimum content requirement.
    (e) By February 1, 2012, and periodically thereafter, the commissioner of commerce shall
determine the wholesale diesel price at various pipeline and refinery terminals in the region, and
the biodiesel price determined after credits and incentives are subtracted at biodiesel plants in
the region. The commissioner shall report wholesale price differences to the governor who, after
consultation with the commissioners of commerce and agriculture, may by executive order adjust
the biodiesel mandate if a price disparity reported by the commissioner will cause economic
hardship to retailers of diesel fuel in this state. Any adjustment must be for a specified period of
time, after which the percentage of biodiesel fuel to be blended into diesel fuel returns to the amount
required in subdivision 2. The biodiesel mandate must not be adjusted to less than five percent.

disclose biodiesel content, stating volume percentage, gallons of biodiesel per gallons of petroleum
diesel base-stock, or an ASTM "Bxx" designation where "xx" denotes the volume percent biodiesel
included in the blended product. This subdivision does not apply to sales or transfers of biodiesel
blend stock between refineries, between terminals, or between a refinery and a terminal.
    Subd. 5. Annual report. Beginning in 2009, the commissioner of agriculture must report by
January 15 of each year to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees
and divisions with jurisdiction over agriculture policy and finance regarding the implementation
of the minimum content requirements in subdivision 2, including information about the price and
supply of biodiesel fuel. The report shall include information about the impacts of the biodiesel
mandate on the development of biodiesel production capacity in the state, and on the use of feedstock
grown or raised in the state for biodiesel production. The report must include any written comments
received from members of the biodiesel fuel task force by January 1 of that year designated by them
for inclusion in the report.

    Subd. 2. Promotion of renewable liquid fuels. (a) The commissioner of agriculture, in
consultation with the commissioners of commerce and the Pollution Control Agency, shall
identify and implement activities necessary for the widespread use of renewable liquid fuels in
the state. Beginning November 1, 2005, and continuing through 2015, the commissioners, or their
designees, shall work with representatives from the renewable fuels industry, petroleum retailers,
refiners, automakers, small engine manufacturers, and other interested groups, to develop annual
recommendations for administrative and legislative action.
      (b) The activities of the commissioners under this subdivision shall include, but not be limited
to:
    (1) developing recommendations for incentives for retailers to install equipment necessary for
dispensing renewable liquid fuels to the public;
    (2) expanding the renewable-fuel options available to Minnesota consumers by obtaining federal
approval for the use of E20 and additional blends that contain a greater percentage of ethanol,
including but not limited to E30 and E50, as gasoline;
   (3) developing recommendations for ensuring that motor vehicles and small engine equipment
have access to an adequate supply of fuel;
    (4) working with the owners and operators of large corporate automotive fleets in the state to

       Sec. 56. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 394.23, is amended to read:
       394.23 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
    The board has the power and authority to prepare and adopt by ordinance, a comprehensive
plan. A comprehensive plan or plans when adopted by ordinance must be the basis for official
controls adopted under the provisions of sections 394.21 to 394.37. The commissioner of natural
resources must provide the natural heritage data from the county biological survey, if available, to
each county for use in the comprehensive plan. When adopting or updating the comprehensive plan,
the board must, if the data is available to the county, consider natural heritage data resulting from
the county biological survey. In a county that is not a greater than 80 percent area, as defined in
section 103G.005, subdivision 10b, the board must consider adopting goals and objectives that will
protect open space and the environment.
   Sec. 57. [394.231] COMPREHENSIVE PLANS IN GREATER MINNESOTA; OPEN
SPACE.
    A county adopting or updating a comprehensive plan in a county outside the metropolitan
area as defined by section 473.121, subdivision 2, and that is not a greater than 80 percent area,
as defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 10b, shall consider adopting goals and objectives for
the preservation of agricultural, forest, wildlife, and open space land, and minimizing development
in sensitive shoreland areas. Within three years of updating the comprehensive plan, the county

shall consider adopting ordinances as part of the county's official controls that encourage the
implementation of the goals and objectives. The county shall consider the following goals and
objectives:
   (1) minimizing the fragmentation and development of agricultural, forest, wildlife, and open
space lands, including consideration of appropriate minimum lot sizes;
   (2) minimizing further development in sensitive shoreland areas;
   (3) minimizing development near wildlife management areas, scientific and natural areas, and
nature centers;
   (4) identification of areas of preference for higher density, including consideration of existing and
necessary water and wastewater services, infrastructure, other services, and to the extent feasible,
encouraging full development of areas previously zoned for nonagricultural uses;
    (5) encouraging development close to places of employment, shopping centers, schools, mass
transit, and other public and private service centers;
   (6) identification of areas where other developments are appropriate; and

  Sec. 6. [192.056] PROTECTION OF RESERVIST-OWNED BUSINESS DURING
ACTIVE SERVICE.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) The definitions in this subdivision apply to this section.
   (b) "Active service" has the meaning given in section 190.05, subdivision 5.
    (c) "Business" means a business wholly owned by a qualified service member, or jointly by
the member and the member's spouse, irrespective of whether the business is a sole proprietorship,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, or other type of business
entity.
   (d) "Qualified service member" means a Minnesota resident who is serving honorably as a
member of the Minnesota National Guard or any other military reserve unit of the United States
armed forces who has been ordered into active service for a period of 60 days or longer.
    Subd. 2. Protection provided. (a) Notwithstanding any other law or rule to the contrary, the
business of a qualified service member may be exempted from civil court proceedings for part or all
of the period of the member's active military service and for up to 60 days thereafter, as provided in
this section.
   (b) If the business of a qualified service member is a defendant in a civil action, the court may,
on its own motion, grant a stay in the proceedings for a minimum of 60 days. The court, on its
9700                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [112TH DAY

own motion, may renew the stay as the court considers appropriate. If the qualified service member
petitions the court in any manner for a stay, the court must grant a stay for a minimum of 60 days,
provided that:
    (1) the service member submits to the court a letter or other communication setting forth
facts stating the manner in which current military duty requirements materially affect the service
member's ability to appear or otherwise participate in the proceedings, and stating a date when the
service member will be available to appear or otherwise participate in the proceedings; and
   (2) the service member submits a letter or other communication from the service member's
commanding officer stating that the service member's current military duty prevents appearance
and that military leave is not authorized for the service member at the time of the letter.
   (c) A service member's communication with the court requesting a stay does not constitute
an appearance for jurisdictional purposes and does not constitute a waiver of any substantive or
procedural defense, including a defense relating to lack of personal jurisdiction.
    (d) A qualified service member who is granted a stay in the action or proceedings against the
member's business may in any manner request from the court an additional stay, which the court
may grant if the service member can show to the satisfaction of the court that the member's military
requirements affect the member's ability to appear. However, the court is not obligated to grant the
additional stay. If the court refuses to grant an additional stay, the court must provide the service
member with information enabling the service member to acquire qualified legal counsel, at the
service member's discretion, for defending the action.
    (e) If a default judgment is entered in a civil action against the business of a qualified service
member during the service member's period of active military service, or within 60 days following
termination of or release from the active military service, the court entering the judgment must, upon
application by or on behalf of the service member, reopen the judgment for the purpose of allowing
the member to defend the action if it appears that:
   (1) the service member was materially affected by reason of that military service in making a
defense to the action; and
   (2) the service member has a meritorious or legal defense to the action or some part of it.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008, and applies to civil court actions
pending or initiated on or after that date.

enlisted persons of the National Guard who die as a result of injuries or other conditions incurred
or aggravated while in such service may, in the discretion of the commander-in-chief, on the
recommendation of the adjutant general, be commissioned by brevet, in the next higher grade than
that held by them at the time of their death.
   (c) If a service member is wounded or killed after a battlefield commission has been approved
and was pending, or if a service member was enrolled in an officer commissioning program at the
time of injury or death, the person may be breveted at the rank of second lieutenant or ensign, as
appropriate, following separation or discharge from military service.
   Subd. 2. Effect of brevet rank. Brevet rank shall be considered strictly honorary and shall confer
no privilege of precedence or command, nor pay any emoluments. Brevet officers, warrant officers,
and enlisted persons may wear the uniform of their brevet grade on occasions of ceremony.

action occurring on or after that date.

   (b) A person's eligibility terminates when the person becomes eligible for benefits under section
135A.52.
    (c) To determine eligibility, the commissioner may require official documentation, including the
person's federal form DD-214 or other official military discharge papers; correspondence from the
United States Veterans Administration; birth certificate; marriage certificate; proof of enrollment at
an eligible institution; signed affidavits; proof of residency; proof of identity; or any other official
documentation the commissioner considers necessary to determine eligibility.
    (d) The commissioner may deny eligibility or terminate benefits under this section to any
person who has not provided sufficient documentation to determine eligibility for the program.
An applicant may appeal the commissioner's eligibility determination or termination of benefits
in writing to the commissioner at any time. The commissioner must rule on any application
or appeal within 30 days of receipt of all documentation that the commissioner requires. The
decision of the commissioner regarding an appeal is final. However, an applicant whose appeal
of an eligibility determination has been rejected by the commissioner may submit an additional
appeal of that determination in writing to the commissioner at any time that the applicant is able
to provide substantively significant additional information regarding the applicant's eligibility for
the program. An approval of an applicant's eligibility by the commissioner following an appeal by
the applicant is not retroactively effective for more than one year or the semester of the person's
original application, whichever is later.
    (e) Upon receiving an application with insufficient documentation to determine eligibility,
the commissioner must notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application that the
application is being suspended pending receipt by the commissioner of sufficient documentation
from the applicant to determine eligibility.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 197.791, subdivision 5, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 5. Benefit amount. (a) On approval by the commissioner of eligibility for the program, the
applicant shall be awarded, on a funds-available basis, the educational assistance under the program
for use at any time according to program rules at any eligible institution.
    (b) The amount of educational assistance in any semester or term for an eligible person must
be determined by subtracting from the eligible person's cost of attendance the amount the person
received or was eligible to receive in that semester or term from:
    (1) the federal Pell Grant;

   (2) the state grant program under section 136A.121; and
    (3) any federal military or veterans educational benefits including but not limited to the
Montgomery GI Bill, GI Bill Kicker, the federal tuition assistance program, vocational rehabilitation
benefits, and any other federal benefits associated with the person's status as a veteran, except
veterans disability payments from the United States Veterans Administration.
    (c) The amount of educational assistance for any eligible person who is a full-time student must
not exceed the following:
   (1) $1,000 per semester or term of enrollment;
   (2) ­
       $2­­0
          ,­ 0
             ­0­ $3,000 per state fiscal year; and
   (3) $10,000 in a lifetime.
For a part-time student, the amount of educational assistance must not exceed $500 per semester or
term of enrollment. For the purpose of this paragraph, a part-time undergraduate student is a student
taking fewer than 12 credits or the equivalent for a semester or term of enrollment and a part-time
graduate student is a student considered part time by the eligible institution the graduate student is
attending. The minimum award for undergraduate and graduate students is $50 per term.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 198.32, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Resident's rights. A resident of a Minnesota veterans home has the right
to complain and otherwise exercise freedom of expression and assembly which is guaranteed
by amendment I of the United States Constitution. The administrator of the home shall inform

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services
based on order of employment in a contracting district. The superintendent of a district shall perform
the following:
   (1) visit and supervise the schools in the district, report and make recommendations about their
condition when advisable or on request by the board;
   (2) recommend to the board employment and dismissal of teachers;
   (3) superintend school grading practices and examinations for promotions;
   (4) make reports required by the commissioner;

     ­­) (7) the arts, for which statewide or locally developed academic standards apply, as determined
by the school district. Public elementary and middle schools must offer at least three and require at
least two of the following four arts areas: dance; music; theater; and visual arts. Public high schools
must offer at least three and require at least one of the following five arts areas: media arts; dance;
music; theater; and visual arts.
     (b) To satisfy this subdivision and the one-half credit physical education requirement under
section 120B.024, paragraph (a), clause (6), the state physical education standard under paragraph
(a) of this subdivision selected by a school district must be consistent with either the six physical
education standards developed by the department's quality teaching network or the six National
Physical Education Standards developed by the National Association for Sport and Physical
Education. To satisfy federal reporting requirements for continued funding under Title VII of the
Physical Education for Progress Act, a school district must notify the department, if applicable, of
its intent to comply with this subdivision. School districts and charter schools also must use either
the department's physical education standards or the national physical education standards under
this paragraph to comply with paragraph (a), clause (5), in providing physical education instruction
and programs to students in kindergarten through grade 8.

alternate achievement standards based on these academic standards for students with individualized
education plans as described under federal law.
    (e) A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation
requirements that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A
school district that incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school
year must provide students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the
opportunity to earn a diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in
effect when the students entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve
instruction or curriculum as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with
sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and 120B.20.
   (f) The commissioner must include the contributions of Minnesota American Indian tribes and
communities as they relate to the academic standards during the review and revision of the required
academic standards.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment except that
paragraph (a), clause (5), applies to students entering the ninth grade in the 2009-2010 school year
and later.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Rigorous course of study; waiver. (a) Upon receiving a student's application signed
by the student's parent or guardian, a school district, area learning center, or charter school must
declare that a student meets or exceeds a specific academic standard required for graduation under
this section if the local school board, the school board of the school district in which the area learning
center is located, or the charter school board of directors determines that the student:
    (1) is participating in a course of study, including an advanced placement or international
baccalaureate course or program; a learning opportunity outside the curriculum of the district,
area learning center, or charter school; or an approved preparatory program for employment or
postsecondary education that is equally or more rigorous than the corresponding state or local
academic standard required by the district, area learning center, or charter school;
    (2) would be precluded from participating in the rigorous course of study, learning opportunity,
or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program if the student were required to
achieve the academic standard to be waived; and
   (3) satisfactorily completes the requirements for the rigorous course of study, learning
opportunity, or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program.
Consistent with the requirements of this section, the local school board, the school board of the
school district in which the area learning center is located, or the charter school board of directors
also may formally determine other circumstances in which to declare that a student meets or exceeds

    (b) A student who satisfactorily completes a postsecondary enrollment options course or
program under section 124D.09, or an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course
or program under section 120B.13, is not required to complete other requirements of the academic
standards corresponding to that specific rigorous course of study.
    (c) A school board may exempt a student from the physical education graduation requirement
under section 120B.024, if the board declares that the student demonstrated mastery of the subject
matter or participation in another learning opportunity, including a Minnesota High School League
athletic activity, that meets or exceeds the physical education standards required for graduation. This
waiver does not reduce the total credits required for graduation.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.023, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Revisions and reviews required. (a) The commissioner of education must
revise and appropriately embed technology and information literacy standards consistent with
recommendations from school media specialists into the state's academic standards and graduation
requirements and implement a review cycle for state academic standards and related benchmarks,
consistent with this subdivision. During each review cycle, the commissioner also must examine
the alignment of each required academic standard and related benchmark with the knowledge and
skills students need for college readiness and advanced work in the particular subject area.
    (b) The commissioner in the 2006-2007 school year must revise and align the state's academic
standards and high school graduation requirements in mathematics to require that students
satisfactorily complete the revised mathematics standards, beginning in the 2010-2011 school year.
Under the revised standards:
    (1) students must satisfactorily complete an algebra I credit by the end of eighth grade; and
   (2) students scheduled to graduate in the 2014-2015 school year or later must satisfactorily
complete an algebra II credit or its equivalent.
The commissioner also must ensure that the statewide mathematics assessments administered to
students in grades 3 through 8 ­     an

   Sec. 12. [120B.299] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. The definitions in this section apply to this chapter.
   Subd. 2. Growth. "Growth" compares the difference between a student's achievement score at
two distinct points in time.
    Subd. 3. Value-added. "Value-added" is the amount of achievement a student demonstrates
above an established baseline. Value-added models are statistical models that require longitudinal
student-level data and vertically scaled assessments that attempt to estimate what portion of a
student's growth can be explained by various education program characteristics.
    Subd. 4. Growth-based value-added. "Growth-based value-added" is a value-added system of
assessments that measures the difference between an established baseline of growth and a student's
growth over time.
   Subd. 5. Adequate yearly progress. "Adequate yearly progress" compares the average
achievement of two different groups of students at two different points in time.
    Subd. 6. State growth norm. (a) "State growth norm" is an established statewide percentile or
standard applicable to all students in a particular grade benchmarked to an established school year.
   (b) Beginning in the 2008-2009 school year, the state growth norm is benchmarked to 2006-2007
school year data until the commissioner next changes the vertically linked scale score.
    (c) Each time the commissioner changes the vertically linked scale score, a recognized
Minnesota assessment group composed of assessment and evaluation directors and staff and
researchers, in collaboration with the Independent Office of Educational Accountability under
section 120B.31, subdivision 3, must recommend a new state growth norm that the commissioner
must consider when revising standards under section 120B.023, subdivision 2.
    Subd. 7. Typical growth. "Typical growth" is the average statewide growth in the vertical scale
from one school year to the next for students with similar prior academic achievement and is based

The commissioner shall establish one or more months during which schools shall administer
the tests to students each school year. Schools that the commissioner identifies for stand-alone
field testing or other national sampling must participate as directed. Superintendents or charter
school directors may appeal in writing to the commissioner for an exemption from a field test
based on undue hardship. The commissioner's decision regarding the appeal is final. For students
enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, only Minnesota basic skills tests in reading,
mathematics, and writing shall fulfill students' basic skills testing requirements for a passing state

shall include the following components in the statewide public reporting system:
    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations, alternate assessments, or exemptions
consistent with applicable federal law, only with parent or guardian approval, for those very few
students for whom the student's individual education plan team under sections 125A.05 and 125A.06
determines that the general statewide test is inappropriate for a student, or for a limited English
proficiency student under section 124D.59, subdivision 2;

reading, mathematics, and science assessments aligned with state academic standards that districts
and sites must use to monitor student growth toward achieving those standards. The commissioner
must not develop statewide assessments for academic standards in social studies, health and
physical education, and the arts. The commissioner must require:
    (1) annual reading and mathematics assessments in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school
level for the 2005-2006 school year and later; and
    (2) annual science assessments in one grade in the grades 3 through 5 span, the grades 6 through
9 8 span, and a life sciences assessment in the grades ­

secondary students measure students' academic knowledge and skills and not students' values,
attitudes, and beliefs.
    (c) Reporting of assessment results must:
    (1) provide timely, useful, and understandable information on the performance of individual
students, schools, school districts, and the state;

proficiency in the context of the state's grade level academic standards. If a state assessment is not
available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript.

(1) acknowledge the impact of significant demographic factors such as residential instability, the
number of single parent families, parents' level of education, and parents' income level on school
outcomes; and (2) organize and report the data so that state and local policy makers can understand
the educational implications of changes in districts' demographic profiles over time. Any report
the commissioner disseminates containing summary data on student performance must integrate
student performance and the demographic factors that strongly correlate with that performance.

criteria for identifying schools and school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth under
section 120B.299. Use of the system at least must advance educators' professional development
and replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning needs. The commissioner
must apply the state growth norm to students in grades 4 through 8 beginning in the 2008-2009
school year, consistent with section 120B.299, subdivision 6, initially benchmarking the state
growth norm to 2006-2007 school year data. The model must allow the user to:
      (1) report student growth at and above the state norm;
    (2) for all student categories with a cell size of at least 20, report and compare aggregated and
disaggregated state growth data using the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001
No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively; and
   (3) measure the effects that grade-level teacher teams, the school, and the school district have
on student growth.

analysis, the commissioner may, to the extent practicable and consistent with this section,
incorporate those measures in determining whether the district or school site shows growth,
including accelerated growth.
    (d) When reporting student performance under section 120B.36, subdivision 1, the
commissioner annually, beginning July 1, 2011, must report two core measures indicating the
extent to which current high school graduates are being prepared for postsecondary academic and
career opportunities:
    (1) a preparation measure indicating the number and percentage of high school graduates
in the most recent school year who completed course work important to preparing them for
postsecondary academic and career opportunities, consistent with the core academic subjects
required for admission to Minnesota's public four-year colleges and universities as determined by
the Office of Higher Education under chapter 136A; and
   (2) a rigorous coursework measure indicating the number and percentage of high school
graduates in the most recent school year who successfully completed one or more college-level
advanced placement, international baccalaureate, postsecondary enrollment options including
concurrent enrollment, other rigorous courses of study under section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, or
industry certification courses or programs.
When reporting the core measures under clauses (1) and (2), the commissioner must also analyze
and report separate categories of information using the nine student categories identified under the
federal 2001 No Child Left Behind Act and two student gender categories of male and female,
respectively.

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­­
                   l­a b­e
                        l­­, valid, replicated evidence showing that when these programs or practices
are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory reading progress. The
program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, instruction in five areas of reading:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and ­e    t­x­­
                                                                            t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
   (b) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the

individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
    (c) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships between
written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that stresses
learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and spelling.
   (d) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read orally with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
    (e) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.
    (f) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.07, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; board composition. Except for the representatives of higher education
and the public, to be eligible for appointment to the Board of Teaching a person must be a teacher
currently teaching in a Minnesota school and fully licensed for the position held and have at least five
years teaching experience in Minnesota, including the two years immediately preceding nomination
and appointment. Each nominee, other than a public nominee, must be selected on the basis of
professional experience and knowledge of teacher education, accreditation, and licensure. The board
must be composed of:
   (1) six teachers who are currently teaching in a Minnesota school or who were teaching at the
time of the appointment, at least four of whom must be teaching in a public school;
   (2) one higher education representative, who must be a faculty member preparing teachers;
   (3) one school administrator; and
   (4) three members of the public, two of whom must be present or former members of school
boards.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Vacant position. With the exception of a teacher who retires from teaching during
the course of completing a board term, the position of a member who leaves Minnesota or whose
employment status changes to a category different from that from which appointed is deemed vacant.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.09, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

in reading, writing, and mathematics as a requirement for initial teacher licensure. Such rules must
require college and universities offering a board-approved teacher preparation program to provide
remedial assistance to persons who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination,
including those for whom English is a second language.
    (c) The board must adopt rules to approve teacher preparation programs. The board, upon
the request of a postsecondary student preparing for teacher licensure or a licensed graduate
of a teacher preparation program, shall assist in resolving a dispute between the person and a
postsecondary institution providing a teacher preparation program when the dispute involves an
institution's recommendation for licensure affecting the person or the person's credentials. At the
board's discretion, assistance may include the application of chapter 14.
    (d) The board must provide the leadership and shall adopt rules for the redesign of teacher
education programs to implement a research based, results-oriented curriculum that focuses
on the skills teachers need in order to be effective. The board shall implement new systems of
teacher preparation program evaluation to assure program effectiveness based on proficiency
of graduates in demonstrating attainment of program outcomes. The board must require that
persons enrolled in a teacher preparation program receive instruction in historical and cultural
competencies related to Minnesota American Indian tribes and communities and their contributions
to Minnesota, consistent with sections 120B.021, subdivision 1, and 124D.71 to 124D.82. The
competencies related to Minnesota American Indian tribes and communities must include, among
other components, standards for instructional practices most effective for successfully teaching
elementary and secondary American Indian students.
    (e) The board must adopt rules requiring successful completion of an examination of general
pedagogical knowledge and examinations of licensure-specific teaching skills. The rules shall be
effective on the dates determined by the board but not later than September 1, 2001.
   (f) The board must adopt rules requiring teacher educators to work directly with elementary or
secondary school teachers in elementary or secondary schools to obtain periodic exposure to the
elementary or secondary teaching environment.
   (g) The board must grant licenses to interns and to candidates for initial licenses.
    (h) The board must design and implement an assessment system which requires a candidate
for an initial license and first continuing license to demonstrate the abilities necessary to perform
selected, representative teaching tasks at appropriate levels.
    (i) The board must receive recommendations from local committees as established by the board

provide direct instruction to pupils in prekindergarten or elementary programs. The board must
require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program to provide

score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English is a second language.
The Board of Teaching shall report annually to the education committees of the legislature on the
total number of teacher candidates during the most recent school year taking the skills examination,
the number who achieve a qualifying score on the examination, the number who do not achieve
a qualifying score on the examination, the distribution of all candidates' scores, the number of
candidates who have taken the examination at least once before, and the number of candidates who
have taken the examination at least once before and achieve a qualifying score.

contingent upon the licensee:
   (1) providing evidence of participating in an approved remedial assistance program provided
by a school district or postsecondary institution that includes a formal diagnostic component in the
specific areas in which the licensee did not obtain qualifying scores; and
    (2) attempting to successfully complete the skills examination during the period of each one-year
license.
   (d) The Board of Teaching must grant continuing licenses only to those persons who have met
board criteria for granting a continuing license, which includes successfully completing the skills
examination in reading, writing, and mathematics.
    (e) All colleges and universities approved by the board of teaching to prepare persons for teacher
licensure must include in their teacher preparation programs a common core of teaching knowledge
and skills to be acquired by all persons recommended for teacher licensure. This common core
shall meet the standards developed by the interstate new teacher assessment and support consortium
in its 1992 "model standards for beginning teacher licensing and development." Amendments to
standards adopted under this paragraph are covered by chapter 14. The board of teaching shall report
annually to the education committees of the legislature on the performance of teacher candidates
on common core assessments of knowledge and skills under this paragraph during the most recent
school year.

provider that is not the enrolling district.
      (b) An online learning student may:
    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;

occurs when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance
and assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other
than a teacher with a Minnesota license.

when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and
assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than
a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants a waiver, a teacher providing
online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in any one online learning
course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under

all courses meet state academic standards, and that the online learning curriculum, instruction and
assessment, expectations for actual teacher contact time or other student-to-teacher communication,
and academic support meet nationally recognized professional standards and are demonstrated as
such in a syllabus provided according to the commissioner's requirements. Once an online learning

provider. The department must review such challenges based on the certification procedures under
paragraph (a). The department may initiate its own review of the validity of an online learning course
offered by an online learning provider.
    (c) The department may collect a fee not to exceed $250 for certifying online learning providers
or $50 per course for reviewing a challenge by an enrolling district.
   (d) The department must develop, publish, and maintain a list of approved online learning
providers and online learning courses and programs that it has reviewed and certified.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from June 30, 2007.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) A sponsor may authorize one or more licensed teachers under
section 122A.18, subdivision 1, to operate a charter school subject to approval by the commissioner.
A board must vote on charter school application for sponsorship no later than 90 days after receiving
the application. The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A or
nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply
to the school except as provided in this section. Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a
school district may create a corporation for the purpose of creating a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may form and operate a school, the sponsor must file an affidavit with
the commissioner stating its intent to authorize a charter school. The affidavit must demonstrate the
sponsor's abilities, capacities, and expertise in fulfilling the responsibilities of a sponsor and state the
terms and conditions under which the sponsor would authorize a charter school and how the sponsor

terms of the written contract between the sponsor and the charter school board of directors under
subdivision 6 in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The sponsor must submit an

affidavit to the commissioner for each charter school it proposes to authorize. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove the sponsor's proposed authorization within 90 days of receipt of the
affidavit. Failure to obtain commissioner approval precludes a sponsor from authorizing the charter
school that was the subject of the affidavit.
    (c) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as a
cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish
a board of directors composed of at least five nonrelated members until a timely election for members
of the charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws. A
charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members. Any staff members
who are employed at the school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a
cooperative, and all parents of children enrolled in the school m
                                                                ­­ay
                                                                   ­ are eligible to participate in the
election for members of the school's board of directors. Licensed teachers employed at the school,
including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a cooperative, must be a majority of
the members of the board of directors before the school completes its third year of operation, unless
the commissioner waives the requirement for a majority of licensed teachers on the board. Board of
director meetings must comply with chapter 13D.
   (d) The granting or renewal of a charter by a sponsoring entity must not be conditioned upon the
bargaining unit status of the employees of the school.
   (e) The granting or renewal of a charter school by a sponsor must not be contingent on the charter
school being required to contract, lease, or purchase services from the sponsor.
    (f) A sponsor may authorize the operators of a charter school to expand the operation of the
charter school to additional sites or to add additional grades at the school beyond those described
in the sponsor's application as approved by the commissioner only after submitting a supplemental
application to the commissioner in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The
supplemental application must provide evidence that:
   (1) the expansion of the charter school is supported by need and projected enrollment;
   (2) the charter school is fiscally sound;
   (3) the sponsor supports the expansion; and
    (4) the building of the additional site meets all health and safety requirements to be eligible for
lease aid.
   ­(­) (g) The commissioner annually must provide timely financial management training to newly
     f­
elected members of a charter school board of directors and ongoing training to other members of a
charter school board of directors. Training must address ways to:
   (1) proactively assess opportunities for a charter school to maximize all available revenue
sources;
   (2) establish and maintain complete, auditable records for the charter school;
   (3) establish proper filing techniques;
   (4) document formal actions of the charter school, including meetings of the charter school board

of directors;
   (5) properly manage and retain charter school and student records;
   (6) comply with state and federal payroll record-keeping requirements; and
    (7) address other similar factors that facilitate establishing and maintaining complete records on
the charter school's operations.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 4a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4a. Conflict of interest. (a) A member of a charter school board of directors is
prohibited from serving as a member of the board of directors or as an employee or agent of or a
contractor with a for-profit entity with whom the charter school contracts, directly or indirectly, for
professional services, goods, or facilities. A violation of this prohibition renders a contract voidable
at the option of the commissioner. The commissioner may reduce a charter school's state aid under
section 127A.42 if the charter school board fails to correct a violation under this subdivision in a
timely manner. A member of a charter school board of directors who violates this prohibition shall
be individually liable to the charter school for any damage caused by the violation.
   (b) An individual may serve as a member of the board of directors if no conflict of interest under
paragraph (a) exists.
     (c) A member of a charter school board of directors that serves as a member of the board of
directors or as an employee or agent of or a contractor with a nonprofit entity with whom the charter
school contracts, directly or indirectly, for professional services, goods, or facilities, must disclose
all potential conflicts to the commissioner. A violation of this requirement makes a contract voidable
at the option of the commissioner. The commissioner may reduce a charter school's aid under section
127A.42 if the charter school fails to correct a violation under this subdivision in a timely manner.
    (d) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to compensation paid
to a teacher employed by the charter school who also serves as a member of the board of directors.
    (e) The conflict of interest provisions under this subdivision do not apply to a teacher who
provides services to a charter school through a cooperative formed under chapter 308A when the
teacher also serves on the charter school board of directors.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Contract. The sponsor's authorization for a charter school must be in the form of a
written contract signed by the sponsor and the board of directors of the charter school. The contract
must be completed within 90 days of the commissioner's approval of the sponsor's proposed
authorization. The contract for a charter school must be in writing and contain at least the following:
   (1) a description of a program that carries out one or more of the purposes in subdivision 1;
   (2) specific outcomes pupils are to achieve under subdivision 10;
   (3) admission policies and procedures;
   (4) management and administration of the school;
   (5) requirements and procedures for program and financial audits;

instruction and services for children with a disability under sections 125A.03 to 125A.24, and
125A.65, a description of the financial parameters within which the charter school will operate to
provide the special instruction and services to children with a disability; and
    (11) the process and criteria the sponsor intends to use to monitor and evaluate the fiscal and
student performance of the charter school, consistent with subdivision 15.
     Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 6a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6a. Audit report. (a) The charter school must submit an audit report to the commissioner
by December 31 each year.
    (b) The charter school, with the assistance of the auditor conducting the audit, must include with

501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that entity must file with the commissioner by February
15 a copy of the annual return required under section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

wishes to return, or February 1 of the calendar year in which the leave is scheduled to terminate.
Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and except for section 122A.46, subdivision 7,
the leave is governed by section 122A.46, including, but not limited to, reinstatement, notice of
intention to return, seniority, salary, and insurance.
   During a leave, the teacher may continue to aggregate benefits and credits in the Teachers'
Retirement Association account by paying both the employer and employee contributions
based upon the annual salary of the teacher for the last full pay period before the leave began.
The retirement association may impose reasonable requirements to efficiently administer this
subdivision.
     Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with a sponsor must be for the term contained in the contract according to subdivision
6. The sponsor may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground listed in
paragraph (b). A sponsor may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the contract for
any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating a contract, the
sponsor shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed action in writing. The
notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and that the charter school's
board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the sponsor within 14 days of
receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to
make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to
the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the sponsor shall give
reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The sponsor shall
conduct an informal hearing before taking final action. The sponsor shall take final action to renew
or not renew a contract by the last day of classes in the school year. If the sponsor is a local board,
the school's board of directors may appeal the sponsor's decision to the commissioner.
    (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
    (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
    (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
    (3) violations of law; or
    (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 308A or 317A, except when the commissioner
approves the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school.
     (c) If at the end of a contract term, ­           e­t

commissioner in accordance with the procedures and limits in subdivision 1, paragraphs (a) and
(b), a district, as defined in this subdivision, may:
    (1) purchase real or personal property under an installment contract or may lease real or personal

interest in P-20 education. The initial membership of the partnership includes the members serving
on the Minnesota P-16 Education Partnership and four legislators appointed as follows:
    (1) one senator from the majority party and one senator from the minority party, appointed by
the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration; and
  (2) one member of the house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house and one
member appointed by the minority leader of the house.
    The chair of the P-16 education partnership must convene the first meeting of the P-20
partnership. Prospective members may be nominated by any partnership member and new members
will be added with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the partnership. The partnership will
also seek input from nonmember organizations whose expertise can help inform the partnership's
work.
    Partnership members shall be represented by the chief executives, presidents, or other formally
designated leaders of their respective organizations, or their designees. The partnership shall meet
at least three times during each calendar year.
    Subd. 2. Powers and duties; report. The partnership shall develop recommendations to the
governor and the legislature designed to maximize the achievement of all P-20 students while
promoting the efficient use of state resources, thereby helping the state realize the maximum value
for its investment. These recommendations may include, but are not limited to, strategies, policies,
or other actions focused on:
   (1) improving the quality of and access to education at all points from preschool through the
graduate education;
   (2) improving preparation for, and transitions to, postsecondary education and work; and

   (3) ensuring educator quality by creating rigorous standards for teacher recruitment, teacher
preparation, induction and mentoring of beginning teachers, and continuous professional
development for career teachers.
    By January 15 of each year, the partnership shall submit a report to the governor and to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction
over P-20 education policy and finance that summarizes the partnership's progress in meeting its
goals and identifies the need for any draft legislation when necessary to further the goals of the
partnership to maximize student achievement while promoting efficient use of resources.

     Sec. 52. IMPLEMENTING A STUDENT GROWTH-BASED VALUE-ADDED SYSTEM.
    (a) To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (b), and to help parents and members of the public compare the reported data, the
commissioner must convene a group of expert school district assessment and evaluation staff,
including a recognized Minnesota assessment group composed of assessment and evaluation
directors and staff and researchers and interested stakeholders, including school superintendents,
school principals, school teachers, and parents to examine the actual statewide performance of
students using Minnesota's growth-based value-added system and establish criteria for identifying
schools and school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth in order to advance educators'
professional development and replicate programs that succeed in meeting students' diverse learning
needs.
    (b) The commissioner must submit a written report to the education committees of the house of
representatives and senate by February 15, 2009, describing the criteria for identifying schools and
school districts that demonstrate accelerated growth. The group convened under this section expires

  Sec. 53. IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS COURSEWORK MEASURES RELATED TO
STUDENT PERFORMANCE.
    To implement the requirements of Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.35, subdivision 3,
paragraph (c), clauses (1) and (2), and to help parents and members of the public compare the
reported data, the commissioner of education must convene a group of recognized and qualified
experts and interested stakeholders, including parents among other stakeholders, to develop a model
projecting anticipated performance of each high school on preparation and rigorous coursework
measures that compares the school with similar schools. The model must use information about
entering high school students based on particular background characteristics that are predictive
of differing rates of college readiness. These characteristics include grade 8 achievement levels,
high school student mobility, high school student attendance, and the size of each entering ninth
grade class. The group of experts and stakeholders may examine other characteristics not part of
the prediction model including the nine student categories identified under the federal 2001 No
Child Left Behind Act, and two student gender categories of male and female, respectively. The
commissioner annually must use the predicted level of entering students' performance to provide
a context for interpreting graduating students' actual performance. The group convened under this
section expires June 30, 2011.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
school report cards beginning July 1, 2011.

3, paragraph (e), the commissioner of education, in consultation with interested stakeholders,
including parents and teachers among other stakeholders, must convene a group of recognized
and qualified experts on student engagement assessment and elementary and secondary classroom
teachers currently teaching in Minnesota schools to:
   (1) identify measures of student engagement that may include student attendance, student
support outside the classroom, parent involvement, and homework indicators, among other
measures;
    (2) review the University of Minnesota student safety and engagement survey instrument and
other commonly recognized survey instruments to determine whether the survey instruments have
sound psychometric properties, are useful for intervention planning, and are suitable instruments
for state accountability purposes; and
    (3) determine through disaggregated use of survey indicators or other means how to report
"safety" in order to comply with federal law.
    (b) The commissioner must submit a written report and all the group's working papers to the
education committees of the house of representatives and senate by February 15, 2009, presenting
the group's responses to paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3). The commissioner must submit a second,

    (a) The commissioner of education, in collaboration with the Independent Office of Educational
Accountability under MS, section 120B.31, subdivision 3, and a recognized Minnesota assessment
group composed of assessment and evaluation directors and staff and researchers, must use
2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school year data to compare and report the results of using the
growth-to-standard and the growth-based value-added models under MS, sections 120B.299,
120B.35, and related sections at the school and school district levels. The report may show how
the growth-to-standard and the growth-based value-added models affect the data and the reporting
of the data on growth indicators related to (i) the size and location of schools and school districts
and (ii) the composition of enrolled students by category, among other indicators. To the extent
feasible, the report also may compare individual student and school results from a value-added
model with the results of the growth-to-standard and the growth-based value-added models.
    (b) Consistent with paragraph (a), the commissioner must submit a report comparing the
growth-to-standard and the growth-based value-added models to the education policy committees
of the legislature by February 1, 2009, and include any recommendations for statutory changes

    The responsibility for special instruction and services for a child with a disability temporarily
placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
    (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time
constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
     (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
f­
­a­ i­i
  c­l ­t

        ­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may
establish reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the
child placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­

However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be the
district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational program
in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­
                                                                                 c­

may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 125A.51, is amended to read:
  125A.51 PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES; EDUCATION
AND TRANSPORTATION.
    The responsibility for providing instruction and transportation for a pupil without a disability
who has a short-term or temporary physical or emotional illness or disability, as determined by the
standards of the commissioner, and who is temporarily placed for care and treatment for that illness
or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When a nonresident district makes an emergency placement without first consulting with
the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice of the
emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision, which the
placing district must then provide.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­

reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
   (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement

outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract
with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

    (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the policy review task force under section 124D.521,
may make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide services that are not offered by a district
adult basic education program or that are supplemental to either the statewide adult basic education
program, or a district's adult basic education program. The commissioner may make grants for:
staff development for adult basic education teachers and administrators; training for volunteer
tutors; training, services, and materials for serving disabled students through adult basic education
programs; statewide promotion of adult basic education services and programs; development and
dissemination of instructional and administrative technology for adult basic education programs;
programs which primarily serve communities of color; adult basic education distance learning
projects, including television instruction programs; and other supplemental services to support the
mission of adult basic education and innovative delivery of adult basic education services.
    (b) The commissioner must establish eligibility criteria and grant application procedures. Grants
under this section must support services throughout the state, focus on educational results for
adult learners, and promote outcome-based achievement through adult basic education programs.
Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the commissioner may make grants under this section from the state
total adult basic education aid set aside for supplemental service grants under section 124D.531. Up
to one-fourth of the appropriation for supplemental service grants must be used for grants for adult
basic education programs to encourage and support innovations in adult basic education instruction
and service delivery. A grant to a single organization cannot exceed $    ­1
                                                                           ­0 ­­0
                                                                             ­0 ,­0

total supplemental services aid. Nothing in this section prevents an approved adult basic education
program from using state or federal aid to purchase supplemental services."
     Correct the title numbers accordingly
     We request the adoption of this report and repassage of the bill.

for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, completing, remodeling, or equipping any buildings

except as otherwise provided in this section. The bonds are payable only from and secured by an
irrevocable pledge of the revenues to be derived from the operation of any buildings or structures
acquired, constructed, completed, remodeled, or equipped in whole or in part with the proceeds of
the bonds and from other income and revenues described in section 136F.92, clause (1), the board by
resolution specifies, and notwithstanding this limitation all bonds issued under sections 136F.90 to

   Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 141.25, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Bond. (a) No license shall be issued to any school which maintains, conducts, solicits
for, or advertises within the state of Minnesota any program, unless the applicant files with the office
a continuous corporate surety bond written by a company authorized to do business in Minnesota
conditioned upon the faithful performance of all contracts and agreements with students made by
the applicant.
    (b)(1) The amount of the surety bond shall be ten percent of the preceding year's gross income
from student tuition, fees, and other required institutional charges, but in no event less than $10,000
nor greater than $250,000, except that a school may deposit a greater amount at its own discretion.
A school in each annual application for licensure must compute the amount of the surety bond
and verify that the amount of the surety bond complies with this subdivision, unless the school
maintains a surety bond equal to at least $250,000. A school that operates at two or more locations
may combine gross income from student tuition, fees, and other required institutional charges for all
locations for the purpose of determining the annual surety bond requirement. The gross tuition and
fees used to determine the amount of the surety bond required for a school having a license for the
sole purpose of recruiting students in Minnesota shall be only that paid to the school by the students
recruited from Minnesota.
    (2) A school required to obtain a private career school license due to the use of "academy,"
"institute," "college," or "university" in its name and which is also licensed by another state agency
or board shall be required to provide a school bond of $10,000.
    (c) The bond shall run to the state of Minnesota and to any person who may have a cause of action
against the applicant arising at any time after the bond is filed and before it is canceled for breach
of any contract or agreement made by the applicant with any student. The aggregate liability of the
surety for all breaches of the conditions of the bond shall not exceed the principal sum deposited by
the school under paragraph (b). The surety of any bond may cancel it upon giving 60 days' notice
in writing to the office and shall be relieved of liability for any breach of condition occurring after
the effective date of cancellation.
    (d) In lieu of bond, the applicant may deposit with the commissioner of finance a sum equal to
the amount of the required surety bond in cash, or securities as may be legally purchased by savings

Education pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, sections 141.21 to 141.32. Licensure is not an

physicians complete and current information concerning their diagnosis, treatment, alternatives,
risks, and prognosis as required by the physician's legal duty to disclose. This information shall be

and residents may be accompanied by a family member or other chosen representative, or both.
This information shall include the likely medical or major psychological results of the treatment
and its alternatives. In cases where it is medically inadvisable, as documented by the attending
physician in a patient's or resident's medical record, the information shall be given to the patient's
or resident's guardian or other person designated by the patient or resident as a representative.
Individuals have the right to refuse this information.

who does not have a new primary address shall register with the law enforcement authority that
has jurisdiction in the area where the person will be staying at least three days before the person is
released from the correctional facility.
    (c) A person who lacks a primary address shall register with the law enforcement authority that

authority with all of the information the individual is required to provide under subdivision 4a.
However, instead of reporting the person's primary address, the person shall describe the location
of where the person is staying with as much specificity as possible.

jurisdiction in the area where the person is staying. This weekly report shall occur between the hours

weekly in-person reporting process is impractical for the person to follow;
   (2) the authority shall explain how the alternative reporting procedure furthers the public safety
objectives of this section;
    (3) the authority shall require the person lacking a primary address to report in person at least
monthly to the authority or the person's corrections agent and shall specify the location where the
person shall report. If the authority determines it would be more practical and would further public
safety for the person to report to another law enforcement authority with jurisdiction where the
person is staying, it may, after consulting with the other law enforcement authority, include this
requirement in the person's alternative reporting process;
   (4) the authority shall require the person to comply with the weekly, in-person reporting process
required under paragraph ­  (d
                             ­­) (e), if the person moves to a new area where this process would be
practical;
   (5) the authority shall require the person to report any changes to the registration information
provided under subdivision 4a and to comply with the periodic registration requirements specified
under paragraph ­(­
                  f­
                   ) (g); and
   (6) the authority shall require the person to comply with the requirements of subdivision 3,
paragraphs (b) and (c), if the person moves to a primary address.

law enforcement authority, the person shall provide the authority with all of the information the
individual is required to provide under this subdivision and subdivision 4a at least annually, unless
the person is required to register under subdivision 1b, paragraph (c), following commitment
pursuant to a court commitment under section 253B.185 or a similar law of another state or the

shall provide the law enforcement authority with all of the information the individual is required to
report under this subdivision and subdivision 4a at least once every three months.

registration information and changes to that information to the bureau within two business days of
receipt of the information.

be deemed to be a person who lacks a primary address, and the person shall comply with the
requirements for a person who lacks a primary address.

offenders required to register on or after that date.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 243.166, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Contents of registration. (a) The registration provided to the corrections agent or
law enforcement authority, must consist of a statement in writing signed by the person, giving
information required by the bureau, a fingerprint card, and photograph of the person taken at the
time of the person's release from incarceration or, if the person was not incarcerated, at the time
the person initially registered under this section. The registration information also must include a
written consent form signed by the person allowing a treatment facility or residential housing unit
or shelter to release information to a law enforcement officer about the person's admission to, or
residence in, a treatment facility or residential housing unit or shelter. Registration information on
adults and juveniles may be maintained together notwithstanding section 260B.171, subdivision 3.
    (b) For persons required to register under subdivision 1b, paragraph (c), following commitment
pursuant to a court commitment under section 253B.185 or a similar law of another state or the
United States, in addition to other information required by this section, the registration provided
to the corrections agent or law enforcement authority must include the person's offense history and
documentation of treatment received during the person's commitment. This documentation is limited
to a statement of how far the person progressed in treatment during commitment.
    (c) Within three days of receipt, the corrections agent or law enforcement authority shall
forward the registration information to the bureau. The bureau shall ascertain whether the person
has registered with the law enforcement authority in the area of the person's primary address, if any,
or if the person lacks a primary address, where the person is staying, as required by subdivision
3a. If the person has not registered with the law enforcement authority, the bureau shall send one
copy to that authority.
    (d) The corrections agent or law enforcement authority may require that a person required to
register under this section appear before the agent or authority to be photographed. The agent or
authority shall forward the photograph to the bureau.
    (1) Except as provided in clause (2), the agent or authority shall require a person required to
register under this section who is classified as a level III offender under section 244.052 to appear
before the agent or authority at least every six months to be photographed.
   (2) The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply during any period where the person to be
photographed is: (i) committed to the commissioner of corrections and incarcerated, (ii) incarcerated

in a regional jail or county jail, or (iii) committed to the commissioner of human services and
receiving treatment in a secure treatment facility.
   (e) During the period a person is required to register under this section, the following provisions
apply:
    (1) Except for persons registering under subdivision 3a, the bureau shall mail a verification
form to the person's last reported primary address. This verification form must provide notice to
the offender that, if the offender does not return the verification form as required, information
about the offender may be made available to the public through electronic, computerized, or other
accessible means. For persons who are registered under subdivision 3a, the bureau shall mail
an annual verification form to the law enforcement authority where the offender most recently
reported. The authority shall provide the verification form to the person at the next weekly meeting
and ensure that the person completes and signs the form and returns it to the bureau. Notice is
sufficient under this paragraph, if the verification form is sent by first class mail to the person's last
reported primary address, or for persons registered under subdivision 3a, to the law enforcement
authority where the offender most recently reported.
    (2) The person shall mail the signed verification form back to the bureau within ten days after
receipt of the form, stating on the form the current and last address of the person's residence and the
other information required under subdivision 4a.
    (3) In addition to the requirements listed in this section, a person who is assigned to risk level II
or III under section 244.052, and who is no longer under correctional supervision for a registration
offense, or a failure to register offense, but who resides, works, or attends school in Minnesota,
shall have an annual in-person contact with a law enforcement authority as provided in this section.
If the person resides in Minnesota, the annual in-person contact shall be with the law enforcement
authority that has jurisdiction over the person's primary address or, if the person has no address, the
location where the person is staying. If the person does not reside in Minnesota but works or attends
school in this state, the person shall have an annual in-person contact with the law enforcement
authority or authorities with jurisdiction over the person's school or workplace. During the month
of the person's birth date, the person shall report to the authority to verify the accuracy of the
registration information and to be photographed. Within three days of this contact, the authority
shall enter information as required by the bureau into the predatory offender registration database
and submit an updated photograph of the person to the bureau's predatory offender registration unit.
    (4) If the person fails to mail the completed and signed verification form to the bureau within
ten days after receipt of the form, or if the person fails to report to the law enforcement authority
during the month of the person's birth date, the person is in violation of this section.
    (5) For any person who fails to mail the completed and signed verification form to the bureau
within ten days after receipt of the form and who has been determined to be a risk level III offender
under section 244.052, the bureau shall immediately investigate and notify local law enforcement
authorities to investigate the person's location and to ensure compliance with this section. The bureau
also shall immediately give notice of the person's violation of this section to the law enforcement
authority having jurisdiction over the person's last registered address or addresses.
For persons required to register under subdivision 1b, paragraph (c), following commitment

person's initial registration.
    (f) When sending out a verification form, the bureau shall determine whether the person to whom
the verification form is being sent has signed a written consent form as provided for in paragraph

the person along with the verification form. A person who receives this written consent form shall
sign and return it to the bureau at the same time as the verification form.

offenders required to register on or after that date.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 243.167, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. When required. (a) In addition to the requirements of section 243.166, a person also
shall register under section 243.166 if:
   (1) the person is convicted of a crime against the person; and
    (2) the person was previously convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for an offense listed in
section 243.166, or a comparable offense in another state, but was not required to register for the
offense because the registration requirements of that section did not apply to the person at the time
the offense was committed or at the time the person was released from imprisonment.
    (b) A person who was previously required to register in any state and who has completed
the registration requirements of that state shall again register under section 243.166 if the person
commits a crime against the person.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008, and applies to persons who
commit crimes against a person on or after that date.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Restriction. Except when ordered by the court pursuant to a finding of necessity
to protect the life of the proposed patient or others or as provided under subdivision 1a, no person
subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be confined in a jail or correctional institution, except
pursuant to chapter 242 or 244.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Exception. A person who is being petitioned for commitment under section 253B.185
and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision 2b or 7, may be
confined at a Department of Corrections or a county correctional or detention facility, rather than
a secure treatment facility, until a determination of the commitment petition as specified in this
subdivision.
   (a) A court may order that a person who is being petitioned for commitment under section

253B.185 be confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to the judicial hold order
under the following circumstances and conditions:
    (1) The person is currently serving a sentence in a Department of Corrections facility and the
court determines that the person has made a knowing and voluntary (i) waiver of the right to be held
in a secure treatment facility and (ii) election to be held in a Department of Corrections facility. The
order confining the person in the Department of Corrections facility shall remain in effect until the
court vacates the order or the person's criminal sentence and conditional release term expire.
   In no case may the person be held in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant only to this
subdivision, and not pursuant to any separate correctional authority, for more than 210 days.
    (2) A person who has elected to be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this
subdivision may revoke the election by filing a written notice of intent to revoke the election with the
court and serving the notice upon the Department of Corrections and the county attorney. The court
shall order the person transferred to a secure treatment facility within 15 days of the date that the
notice of revocation was filed with the court, except that, if the person has additional time to serve
in prison at the end of the 15-day period, the person shall not be transferred to a secure treatment
facility until the person's prison term expires. After a person has revoked an election to remain in a
Department of Corrections facility under this subdivision, the court may not adopt another election
to remain in a Department of Corrections facility without the agreement of both parties and the
Department of Corrections.
    (3) Upon petition by the commissioner of corrections, after notice to the parties and opportunity
for hearing and for good cause shown, the court may order that the person's place of confinement
be changed from the Department of Corrections to a secure treatment facility.
    (4) While at a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this subdivision, the person shall
remain subject to all rules and practices applicable to correctional inmates in the facility in which
the person is placed including, but not limited to, the powers and duties of the commissioner of
corrections under section 241.01, powers relating to use of force under section 243.52, and the right
of the commissioner of corrections to determine the place of confinement in a prison, reformatory,
or other facility.
    (5) A person may not be confined in a Department of Corrections facility under this provision
beyond the end of the person's executed sentence or the end of any applicable conditional release
period, whichever is later. If a person confined in a Department of Corrections facility pursuant to
this provision reaches the person's supervised release date and is subject to a period of conditional
release, the period of conditional release shall commence on the supervised release date even though
the person remains in the Department of Corrections facility pursuant to this provision. At the end
of the later of the executed sentence or any applicable conditional release period, the person shall
be transferred to a secure treatment facility.
    (6) Nothing in this section may be construed to establish a right of an inmate in a state
correctional facility to participate in sex offender treatment. This section must be construed in a
manner consistent with the provisions of section 244.03.
    (b) The committing county may offer a person who is being petitioned for commitment under
section 253B.185 and who is placed under a judicial hold order under section 253B.07, subdivision
2b or 7, the option to be held in a county correctional or detention facility rather than a secure

and the commitment respondent. If a person makes such an election under this paragraph, the
court hold order shall specify the terms of the agreement, including the conditions for revoking
the election.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.045, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Facilities. Each county or a group of counties shall maintain or provide by contract
a facility for confinement of persons held temporarily for observation, evaluation, diagnosis,
treatment, and care. When the temporary confinement is provided at a regional treatment center,
the commissioner shall charge the county of financial responsibility for the costs of confinement of
persons hospitalized under section 253B.05, subdivisions 1 and 2, and section 253B.07, subdivision
2b, except that the commissioner shall bill the responsible health plan first. If the person has
health plan coverage, but the hospitalization does not meet the criteria in subdivision 6 or section
62M.07, 62Q.53, or 62Q.535, the county is responsible. When a person is temporarily confined in
a Department of Corrections facility solely under subdivision 1a, and not based on any separate
correctional authority: (1) the commissioner of corrections may charge the county of financial
responsibility for the costs of confinement; and (2) the Department of Human Services shall use
existing appropriations to fund all remaining nonconfinement costs. The funds received by the
commissioner for the confinement and nonconfinement costs are appropriated to the department
for these purposes. "County of financial responsibility" means the county in which the person
resides at the time of confinement or, if the person has no residence in this state, the county which
initiated the confinement. The charge for confinement in a facility operated by the commissioner of
human services shall be based on the commissioner's determination of the cost of care pursuant to
section 246.50, subdivision 5. When there is a dispute as to which county is the county of financial
responsibility, the county charged for the costs of confinement shall pay for them pending final
determination of the dispute over financial responsibility. Disputes about the county of financial
responsibility shall be submitted to the commissioner to be settled in the manner prescribed in
section 256G.09.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.08, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Time for commitment hearing. (a) The hearing on the commitment petition
shall be held within 14 days from the date of the filing of the petition, except that the hearing on
a commitment petition pursuant to section 253B.185 shall be held within 90 days from the date of
the filing of the petition. For good cause shown, the court may extend the time of hearing up to an
additional 30 days. The proceeding shall be dismissed if the proposed patient has not had a hearing
on a commitment petition within the allowed time.
    (b) The proposed patient, or the head of the treatment facility in which the person is held, may
demand in writing at any time that the hearing be held immediately. Unless the hearing is held
within five days of the date of the demand, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, the
petition shall be automatically discharged if the patient is being held in a treatment facility pursuant
to court order. For good cause shown, the court may extend the time of hearing on the demand for an
additional ten days. This paragraph does not apply to a commitment petition brought under section
253B.18 or 253B.185.

245.467, subdivision 6; 245.4876, subdivision 7; 260B.171; 260B.235, subdivision 8; 260C.171;
and 609.749, subdivision 6, or any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, prior to filing a
petition for commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or as a sexually dangerous person,
and upon notice to the proposed patient, the county attorney or the county attorney's designee may
move the court for an order granting access to any records or data, to the extent it relates to the
proposed patient, for the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if
a petition is filed, to support the allegations set forth in the petition.
    The court may grant the motion if: (1) the Department of Corrections refers the case for
commitment as a sexual psychopathic personality or a sexually dangerous person; or (2) upon a
showing that the requested category of data or records may be relevant to the determination by the
county attorney or designee. The court shall decide a motion under this subdivision within 48 hours
after a hearing on the motion. Notice to the proposed patient need not be given upon a showing
that such notice may result in harm or harassment of interested persons or potential witnesses.
    Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 13 or other state law, a county attorney considering the
civil commitment of a person under this section may obtain records and data from the Department
of Corrections or any probation or parole agency in this state upon request, without a court order, for
the purpose of determining whether good cause exists to file a petition and, if a petition is filed, to
support the allegations set forth in the petition. At the time of the request for the records, the county
attorney shall provide notice of the request to the person who is the subject of the records.
   Data collected pursuant to this subdivision shall retain their original status and, if not public, are
inadmissible in any court proceeding unrelated to civil commitment, unless otherwise permitted.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 253B.185, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Financial responsibility. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state facility" has the
meaning given in section 246.50 and also includes a Department of Corrections facility when the
proposed patient is confined in such a facility pursuant to section 253B.045, subdivision 1a.
    (b) Notwithstanding sections 246.54, 253B.045, and any other law to the contrary, when a
petition is filed for commitment under this section pursuant to the notice required in section 244.05,
subdivision 7, the state and county are each responsible for 50 percent of the cost of the person's
confinement at a state facility or county jail, prior to commitment.
    (c) The county shall submit an invoice to the state court administrator for reimbursement of the
state's share of the cost of confinement.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the state's responsibility for reimbursement is limited to the
amount appropriated for this purpose.

investigation is inactive as defined in section 13.82, subdivision 7. Once the investigation is
inactive, and the recipient of the data authorizes release to the data subject, the auditing data and
workflow and routing data maintained by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are classified as
private data on individuals as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 12, or nonpublic data as defined
in section 13.02, subdivision 9. The same data maintained by any other government entity are

period employer or charged to the reimbursable account of a base period nonprofit or government
employer that has elected to be liable for reimbursements except as provided in subdivisions 2 and 3.
The amount of unemployment benefits used in computing the future tax rate of taxpaying employers
or charged to the reimbursable account of a nonprofit or government employer that has elected to
be liable for reimbursements is the same percentage of the total amount of unemployment benefits
paid as the percentage of wage credits from the employer is of the total amount of wage credits from
all the applicant's base period employers.
  In making computations under this subdivision, the amount of wage credits, if not a whole dollar,
must be computed to the nearest whole dollar.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.047, subdivision 2, is amended to

    Subd. 2. Exceptions for all employers. Unemployment benefits paid will not be used in
computing the future tax rate of a taxpaying base period employer or charged to the reimbursable
account of a base period nonprofit or government employer that has elected to be liable for
reimbursements when:

misconduct as determined under section 268.095. This exception applies only to unemployment
benefits paid for periods after the applicant's discharge from employment;
    (2) an applicant's discharge from that employment occurred because a law required removal of
the applicant from the position the applicant held;
   (3) the employer is in the tourist or recreation industry and is in active operation of business less

600 times the applicable state or federal minimum wage;
    (4) the employer provided regularly scheduled part-time employment to the applicant during the
applicant's base period and continues to provide the applicant with regularly scheduled part-time

    (5) the employer is a fire department or firefighting corporation or operator of a life-support
transportation service, and continues to provide employment for the applicant as a volunteer
firefighter or a volunteer ambulance service personnel during the benefit year on the same basis that
employment was provided in the base period. This exception terminates effective the first week
that the employer fails to meet the benefit year employment requirements;
    (6) the applicant's unemployment from this employer was a direct result of the condemnation
of property by a governmental agency, a fire, flood, or act of nature, where 25 percent or more of
the employees employed at the affected location, including the applicant, became unemployed as a
result. This exception does not apply where the unemployment was a direct result of the intentional

employment after active duty; or
   (11) the trust fund was reimbursed for the unemployment benefits by the federal government.

   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.085, subdivision 3, is amended to

received, or has filed for payment, equal to or in excess of the applicant's weekly unemployment
benefit amount, in the form of:
   (1) vacation pay paid upon temporary, indefinite, or seasonal separation. This clause does not
apply to (i) vacation pay paid upon a permanent separation from employment, or (ii) vacation pay
paid from a vacation fund administered by a union or a third party not under the control of the
employer;
   (2) severance pay, bonus pay, sick pay, and any other payments, except earnings under

     (3) pension, retirement, or annuity payments from any plan contributed to by a base period
employer including the United States government, except Social Security benefits that are provided
for in subdivision 4. The base period employer is considered to have contributed to the plan if the
contribution is excluded from the definition of wages under section 268.035, subdivision 29, clause
(1).
   An applicant is not considered to have received the lump sum payment if the applicant
immediately deposits that payment in a qualified pension plan or account.

    (1) if the payments are made periodically, the total of the payments to be received is divided by
the applicant's last level of regular weekly pay from the employer; or
   (2) if the payment is made in a lump sum, that sum is divided by the applicant's last level of
regular weekly pay from the employer.
   (c) If the payment is less than the applicant's weekly unemployment benefit amount,
unemployment benefits are reduced by the amount of the payment. If the computation of reduced
unemployment benefits is not a whole dollar, it is rounded down to the next lower whole dollar.

make if genuinely interested in obtaining suitable employment under the existing conditions in the
labor market area. Limiting the search to positions that are not available or are above the applicant's
training, experience, and qualifications is not "actively seeking suitable employment."
    (b) To be considered "actively seeking suitable employment" an applicant must, when
reasonable, contact those employers from whom the applicant was laid off because of lack of work
and request suitable employment.
   (c) If reasonable prospects of suitable employment in the applicant's usual or customary
occupation do not exist, the applicant must actively seek other suitable employment to be
considered "actively seeking suitable employment." This applies to an applicant who is seasonally
unemployed.

existing connection, whichever is less, but not to exceed the maximum grant level determined by
the USDA/RECD as needed to keep the project affordable.
    (b) For a governmental unit not receiving grant funding from the USDA/RECD, the authority
shall provide assistance in the form of a loan for the eligible project costs plus the outstanding
balance on any existing wastewater system debt that together exceed five percent of the market value
of properties in the project service area, less the amount of any other grant funding received by the
governmental unit for the project. A governmental unit may not receive a loan under this paragraph
for more than $4,000,000 or $15,000 per existing connection, whichever is less, unless specifically

interest, must be repaid as provided in subdivision 7, and must only be provided in conjunction with
a loan from the clean water revolving fund under section 446A.07.
   (c) Notwithstanding the limits in paragraphs (a) and (b), for a governmental unit receiving
supplemental assistance under this section after January 1, 2002, if the authority determines that the
governmental unit's construction and installation costs are significantly increased due to geological
conditions of crystalline bedrock or karst areas and discharge limits that are more stringent than
secondary treatment, the authority shall provide assistance in the form of half grant and half
loan. Assistance from the authority may not be more than $25,000 per existing connection. Any
additional grant amount received for the same project must be used to reduce the amount of the
governmental unit's loan from the clean water p  ­o­­l

respect to an application period. If any application is determined by the authority to be incomplete or

inaccurate, the authority shall notify the applicant and specify the missing or inaccurate information.
    (d) The executive director and the staff of the authority shall evaluate the applications to
determine if the application should be accepted or rejected by the authority.
    (e) The authority is not obligated to accept any application including those complete and
accurate and submitted by any specified deadline for submission if the authority determines that it
is not practicable to fund the loan for any reason including, but not limited to, the creditworthiness
of the applicant, the proposed loan amount, the term and repayment schedule, the sources of
funding available to the authority, and current market conditions. Upon acceptance and approval
of an application by the authority, the authority may require that the applicant authorize, execute,
and deliver a commitment to the authority within such time period specified by the authority in its
acceptance of the application. The authority may reject an approved application for failure by the
applicant to authorize, execute, and deliver a commitment by the specified deadline.

the authority pursuant to the credit enhanced bond program are as provided by this section, any
applicable bond resolution or series bond resolution of the authority, any trust indenture pursuant
to which any series of bonds of the authority are issued, the regulatory agreement, the commitment
and the general obligation bond, and the authorizing resolution of the borrower.
    (b) The loan must be made by the authority through its purchase of the general obligation bond
of the borrower. The borrower shall provide the authority with the opinion of nationally recognized
bond counsel as to the valid authorization, issuance, and enforceability of the general obligation
bond of the borrower, and the exclusion of interest thereon from gross income for the purposes of
federal taxation, subject to customary qualifications. The general obligation bond of the borrower
may pledge other specified sources of revenues for repayment to the extent permitted or required
by law, in addition to the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing powers of the borrower.
    (c) The authority may disburse the proceeds of the loan as a single payment for the general
obligation bond or from time to time pursuant to draw requests if the general obligation bond of the
borrower is structured as a periodic drawdown bond. In the event the authority pays for the general
obligation bond in a single payment, the borrower shall establish a project account and disburse the
proceeds of its general obligation bond solely for costs of the project approved in its application
pursuant to such additional requirements specified in the regulatory agreement.
    (d) In order to facilitate the issuance of the authority's revenue bonds to finance a pool of loans to
different borrowers, the authority may require the borrower in the commitment to issue its general
obligation bond on a date certain in the future, and may require the borrower to pay the costs incurred
by the authority as a result of the borrower's failure to deliver its general obligation bond as required
by the commitment. The commitment may also require the borrower to provide to the authority
full disclosure of all material facts and financial information relating to the borrower that would be
required if the borrower issued its general obligation bond to the public, certified as to completeness
and accuracy by authorized officers of the borrower, and authorization for the authority to use such
information in connection with the sale of the authority's revenue bonds or disclosure relating to the
authority's revenue bonds.
   (e) In addition to delivering its general obligation bond, each borrower shall enter into a
regulatory agreement with the authority providing additional terms of the loan as the authority
may specify, including providing to the authority periodic reports and information relating to

the acquisition or construction of the project and use of the proceeds of the borrower's general
obligation bond and periodic operating, financial, and other information as to the creditworthiness
of the borrower, and providing and filing continuing secondary market disclosure to the extent
required by the authority.
    (f) The purchase or commitment to purchase general obligation bonds of borrowers by the
authority shall be subject to the availability of proceeds of revenue bonds of the authority for
such purpose and the authority is not liable to any borrower for the failure to purchase its general
obligation bond pursuant to a commitment or any other agreement if proceeds of the authority's
revenue bonds are not available for any reason.
    Subd. 8. Interest rate determination. The rate of interest on the general obligation bonds of the
borrower must be the true interest cost on the revenue bonds of the authority issued to purchase such
general obligation bonds of the borrower plus the ongoing percentage fee charged by the authority
under subdivision 10; provided that the interest rate must not exceed any limit imposed by federal
tax law with respect to the authority's revenue bonds.
    Subd. 9. Market considerations. The authority may suspend offering loans if it is determined
by the executive director that there are extreme or unusual events impacting the bond market and
that to continue making loans would be detrimental to holders of the authority's revenue bonds or the
financial viability of the credit enhanced bond program, or if the state is warned by one of its rating
agencies that continuing to make loans will result in lowering the state's bond rating. If the making
of loans is suspended under this section, the authority shall have the option to resume making loans
once it has determined that the conditions for suspending the program no longer exist.
    Subd. 10. Fees. The authority shall charge a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000 payable by
each applicant upon submission of an application to the authority. A separate application fee must
be payable for each application submitted, including a resubmitted application for an application
that was rejected by the authority or determined to be incomplete or inaccurate by the authority.
The authority shall charge an ongoing periodic fee of ten basis points of the outstanding principal
amount of the loan to be added to, and be a component of, the interest rate on the general obligation
bonds of the borrower.
    Subd. 11. Authority revenue bonds. (a) The authority is authorized to issue revenue bonds as
provided in this chapter to fund the credit enhanced bond program. The revenue bonds may be issued
in one or more series pursuant to a resolution of the authority or a series resolution or pursuant to a
trust indenture with a financial institution with trust powers as trustee, authorized by resolution of
the authority. Any issue of bonds may be used to fund one or more loans, may be payable by the
loans funded from such issue of bonds and such additional loans as pledged by the authority, and
may be payable on a subordinated basis to other bonds. As permitted by the terms of any revenue
bonds issued by the authority, the authority may sell the general obligations pledged to the payment
of the revenue bonds and any proceeds of the sale in excess of those used to pay the principal of
the revenue bonds must be deposited to the credit enhanced bond program fund and may be used to
purchase additional general obligation bonds of borrowers, to provide credit enhancement for the
authority's revenue bonds, or to pay any other expense of the credit enhanced bond program.
   (b) The authority may issue short-term bonds in anticipation of issuing long-term bonds for the
purpose of acquiring general obligation bonds of borrowers.
   (c) Bonds issued by the authority for the credit enhanced bond program must not be general

obligations of the authority to the payment of which the general assets of the authority are pledged
or available for payment. All bonds issued for the credit enhanced bond programs by the authority
must be revenue bonds payable solely from the sources specified in the bond.
   Subd. 12. Reports, disclosure, audits. (a) During the term of the loan the borrower shall provide
written reports to the authority. The content and timing of these reports must be as specified in the
regulatory agreement.
    (b) During the term of the loan the borrower shall disclose to the authority any material
information or events adversely affecting the creditworthiness of the borrower as specified in the
regulatory agreement. If required by the authority in a regulatory agreement, the borrower shall
enter into a continuing disclosure undertaking to provide disclosure to the market.
    (c) During the term of the loan, the borrower shall provide to the authority on an annual basis
financial statements of the borrower audited by an independent accounting firm, as further specified

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
    We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 3235 report that we have agreed upon the items in
dispute and recommend as follows:
    That the House recede from its amendments and that S.F. No. 3235 be further amended as
follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 6.715, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Review of data; data protection. If, before releasing a report, the state auditor provides
a person with data relating to the audit for the purpose of review and verification of the data, the
person must protect the data from unlawful disclosure or be subject to the penalties and liabilities
provided in sections 13.08 and 13.09.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.03, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Request for access to data. (a) Upon request to a responsible authority or designee,
9860                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [112TH DAY

a person shall be permitted to inspect and copy public government data at reasonable times and
places, and, upon request, shall be informed of the data's meaning. If a person requests access for
the purpose of inspection, the responsible authority may not assess a charge or require the requesting
person to pay a fee to inspect data.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "inspection" includes, but is not limited to, the visual inspection
of paper and similar types of government data. Inspection does not include printing copies by the
government entity, unless printing a copy is the only method to provide for inspection of the data.
In the case of data stored in electronic form and made available in electronic form on a remote
access basis to the public by the government entity, inspection includes remote access to the data
by the public and the ability to print copies of or download the data on the public's own computer
equipment. Nothing in this section prohibits a government entity from charging a reasonable fee for
remote access to data under a specific statutory grant of authority. A government entity may charge
a fee for remote access to data where either the data or the access is enhanced at the request of the
person seeking access.
    (c) The responsible authority or designee shall provide copies of public data upon request. If a
person requests copies or electronic transmittal of the data to the person, the responsible authority
may require the requesting person to pay the actual costs of searching for and retrieving government
data, including the cost of employee time, and for making, certifying, ­ co
                                                                          ­m­p i­i

transmitting the copies of the data or the data, but may not charge for separating public from not
public data. However, if 100 or fewer pages of black and white, letter or legal size paper copies are
requested, actual costs shall not be used, and instead, the responsible authority may charge no more
than 25 cents for each page copied. If the responsible authority or designee is not able to provide
copies at the time a request is made, copies shall be supplied as soon as reasonably possible.
    (d) When a request under this subdivision involves any person's receipt of copies of public
government data that has commercial value and is a substantial and discrete portion of or an
entire formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, process, database, or
system developed with a significant expenditure of public funds by the government entity, the
responsible authority may charge a reasonable fee for the information in addition to the costs of
making, ­­

demonstrated by the government entity to relate to the actual development costs of the information.
The responsible authority, upon the request of any person, shall provide sufficient documentation
to explain and justify the fee being charged.
    (e) The responsible authority of a government entity that maintains public government data in a
computer storage medium shall provide to any person making a request under this section a copy of
any public data contained in that medium, in electronic form, if the government entity can reasonably
make the copy or have a copy made. This does not require a government entity to provide the data
in an electronic format or program that is different from the format or program in which the data
are maintained by the government entity. The entity may require the requesting person to pay the
actual cost of providing the copy.
   (f) If the responsible authority or designee determines that the requested data is classified so as to
deny the requesting person access, the responsible authority or designee shall inform the requesting
person of the determination either orally at the time of the request, or in writing as soon after that
time as possible, and shall cite the specific statutory section, temporary classification, or specific
provision of federal law on which the determination is based. Upon the request of any person denied

access to data, the responsible authority or designee shall certify in writing that the request has
been denied and cite the specific statutory section, temporary classification, or specific provision of
federal law upon which the denial was based.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.08, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Action for damages. Notwithstanding section 466.03, a responsible authority or
government entity which violates any provision of this chapter is liable to a person or representative
of a decedent who suffers any damage as a result of the violation, and the person damaged or a
representative in the case of private data on decedents or confidential data on decedents may bring
an action against the responsible authority or government entity to cover any damages sustained,
plus costs and reasonable attorney fees. In the case of a willful violation, the government entity shall,
in addition, be liable to exemplary damages of not less than ­    $1
                                                                   ­0­­

$15,000 for each violation. The state is deemed to have waived any immunity to a cause of action
brought under this chapter.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 13.08, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Action to compel compliance. (a) In addition to the remedies provided in subdivisions
1 to 3 or any other law, any aggrieved person seeking to enforce the person's rights under this chapter
or obtain access to data may bring an action in district court to compel compliance with this chapter
and may recover costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, as determined by the
court. If the court determines that an action brought under this subdivision is frivolous and without
merit and a basis in fact, it may award reasonable costs and attorney fees to the responsible authority.
If the court issues an order to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court may impose a
civil penalty of up to $
                       ­3­0
                          ­0­ $1,000 against the government entity. This penalty is payable to the state
general fund and is in addition to damages under subdivision 1. The matter shall be heard as soon
as possible. In an action involving a request for government data under section 13.03 or 13.04, the
court may inspect in camera the government data in dispute, but shall conduct its hearing in public
and in a manner that protects the security of data classified as not public. If the court issues an order
to compel compliance under this subdivision, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the
commissioner of administration.
   (b) In determining whether to assess a civil penalty under this subdivision, the court shall
consider whether the government entity has substantially complied with general data practices
under this chapter, including but not limited to, whether the government entity has:
   (1) designated a responsible authority under section 13.02, subdivision 16;
   (2) designated a data practices compliance official under section 13.05, subdivision 13;
   (3) prepared the public document that names the responsible authority and describes the
records and data on individuals that are maintained by the government entity under section 13.05,
subdivision 1;
    (4) developed public access procedures under section 13.03, subdivision 2; procedures to
guarantee the rights of data subjects under section 13.05, subdivision 8; and procedures to ensure
that data on individuals are accurate and complete and to safeguard the data's security under section
13.05, subdivision 5;
   (5) acted in conformity with an opinion issued under section 13.072 that was sought by a
9862                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [112TH DAY

government entity or another person; or
    (6) provided ongoing training to government entity personnel who respond to requests under
this chapter.
    (c) The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff who has brought an
action under this subdivision if the government entity that is the defendant in the action was also
the subject of a written opinion issued under section 13.072 and the court finds that the opinion is
directly related to the cause of action being litigated and that the government entity did not act in
conformity with the opinion.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.202, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Metropolitan government. (a) Affirmative action plans. Treatment of data relating
to metropolitan agency affirmative action plans is governed by section 473.143, subdivisions 5 and
7.
   (b) Contracts for management services. Data relating to compensation of personnel who work
under a management service contract are classified by section 473.405, subdivision 12.
   (c) Arena acquisition. Certain data in connection with a decision whether to acquire a sports
arena are classified under section 473.598, subdivision 4.
   (d) Airports commission. Certain airline data submitted to the Metropolitan Airports
Commission in connection with the issuance of revenue bonds are classified under section
473.6671, subdivision 3.
   (e) Solid waste landfill fee. Information obtained from the operator of a mixed municipal solid
waste disposal facility under section 473.843 is classified under section 473.843, subdivision 4.
    (f) Metropolitan airport parking customers. Data relating to applicants for or users of
automated parking facilities at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport are classified under
section 473.674.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.32, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 11. Data sharing; improving instruction. The following educational data may be shared
between the Department of Education and the Minnesota Office of Higher Education as authorized
by Code of Federal Regulations, title 34, section 99.31(a)(6), to analyze instruction in school districts
for purposes of improvement:
    (1) attendance data, including name of school or institution, school district, year or term of
attendance, and term type;
   (2) student demographic and enrollment data;
   (3) academic performance and testing data; and
   (4) special academic services received by a student.
Any analysis of or report on the data must contain only summary data.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.355, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
112TH DAY]                                      WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 2008                                                               9863

    Subd. 3. Prohibition on use of Social Security number on face of mailings. A government

that displays a Social Security number on the outside of the item or in a manner where the Social
Security number is visible without opening the item.

    Subd. 2a. Disclosure of data. During the time when a civil legal action is determined to be
pending under subdivision 1, any person may bring an action in the district court in the county where
         i­ are maintained to obtain disclosure of data classified as confidential or protected nonpublic
the data ­s
under subdivision 2. The court may order that all or part of the data be released to the public or to the
person bringing the action. In making the determination whether data shall be disclosed, the court
shall consider whether the benefit to the person bringing the action or to the public outweighs any
harm to the public, the government entity, or any person identified in the data. The data in dispute
shall be examined by the court in camera.

or telephone number at which the appointee can be reached.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 13.6905, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

authority may hire an individual pending completion of a background check under subdivision
1 but shall notify the individual that the individual's employment may be terminated based on
the result of the background check. A school hiring authority is not liable for failing to hire or
for terminating an individual's employment based on the result of a background check under this
section.
    (b) An individual must be informed by the school hiring authority if the individual's application
to be an employee or volunteer in the district has been denied as a result of a background check
conducted under this section. The school hiring authority must also inform an individual who is a
current employee or volunteer if the individual's employment or volunteer status in the district is

or an education district under Minnesota Statutes 1997 Supplement, section 123.35, a charter school
under section 124D.10, an intermediate school district under section 136D.01, and a joint powers
district under section 471.59.
   (b) "School hiring authority" means the school principal or other person having general control
and supervision of the school.
    (c) "Security violation" means failing to prevent or failing to institute safeguards to prevent the
access, use, retention, or dissemination of information in violation of the security and management
control outsourcing standard established by the state compact officer under section 299C.58, article
I, paragraph (2), clause (B).
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 4. Third-party contractors; responsibility for criminal history record information.
(a) For purposes of this section, a school hiring authority may contract with an eligible third party to
conduct the criminal history background check required under subdivision 1. Before entering into
the contract, the school hiring authority must:
   (1) provide the state compact officer with the name of the proposed third-party contractor and a
copy of the proposed contract;
   (2) determine from the state compact officer whether the proposed contractor has committed a
security violation; and
    (3) request and receive permission from the state compact officer to enter into the contract with
the proposed contractor.
    A third-party contractor that has committed a security violation is ineligible to participate under
this section.
    (b) The contract must specify the purposes for which the background check information may be
made available and incorporate into the contract by reference the management control outsourcing
standard referred to in subdivision 3, paragraph (c). A third-party contractor under this section is
subject to section 13.05, subdivision 11.
    (c) A school hiring authority must inform an individual who is the subject of a criminal history
background check that the individual has the right to request and obtain from the school hiring
authority a copy of the background check report. A school hiring authority may charge the individual
for the actual cost of providing a copy of the report. An individual who is the subject of a criminal
history background check has the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of information
contained in the background check report under section 13.04, subdivision 4.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260B.171, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
   Subd. 5. Peace officer records of children. (a) Except for records relating to an offense where
proceedings are public under section 260B.163, subdivision 1, peace officers' records of children
who are or may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts shall be kept separate from
records of persons 18 years of age or older and are private data but shall be disseminated: (1) by
order of the juvenile court, (2) as required by section 121A.28, (3) as authorized under section 13.82,
9866                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [112TH DAY

subdivision 2, (4) to the child or the child's parent or guardian unless disclosure of a record would
interfere with an ongoing investigation, (5) to the Minnesota crime victims reparations board as
required by section 611A.56, subdivision 2, clause (f), for the purpose of processing claims for crime
victims reparations, or (6) as otherwise provided in this subdivision. Except as provided in paragraph
(c), no photographs of a child taken into custody may be taken without the consent of the juvenile
court unless the child is alleged to have violated section 169A.20. Peace officers' records containing
data about children who are victims of crimes or witnesses to crimes must be administered consistent
with section 13.82, subdivisions 2, 3, 6, and 17. Any person violating any of the provisions of this
subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
    In the case of computerized records maintained about juveniles by peace officers, the
requirement of this subdivision that records about juveniles must be kept separate from adult
records does not mean that a law enforcement agency must keep its records concerning juveniles
on a separate computer system. Law enforcement agencies may keep juvenile records on the same
computer as adult records and may use a common index to access both juvenile and adult records
so long as the agency has in place procedures that keep juvenile records in a separate place in
computer storage and that comply with the special data retention and other requirements associated
with protecting data on juveniles.
   (b) Nothing in this subdivision prohibits the exchange of information by law enforcement
agencies if the exchanged information is pertinent and necessary for law enforcement purposes.
    (c) A photograph may be taken of a child taken into custody pursuant to section 260B.175,
subdivision 1, clause (b), provided that the photograph must be destroyed when the child reaches
the age of 19 years. The commissioner of corrections may photograph juveniles whose legal
custody is transferred to the commissioner. Photographs of juveniles authorized by this paragraph
may be used only for institution management purposes, case supervision by parole agents, and to
assist law enforcement agencies to apprehend juvenile offenders. The commissioner shall maintain
photographs of juveniles in the same manner as juvenile court records and names under this section.
    (d) Traffic investigation reports are open to inspection by a person who has sustained physical
harm or economic loss as a result of the traffic accident. Identifying information on juveniles who are
parties to traffic accidents may be disclosed as authorized under section 13.82, subdivision ­   4 6, and
accident reports required under section 169.09 may be released under section 169.09, subdivision
13, unless the information would identify a juvenile who was taken into custody or who is suspected
of committing an offense that would be a crime if committed by an adult, or would associate a
juvenile with the offense, and the offense is not an adult court traffic offense under section 260B.225.
    (e) The head of a law enforcement agency or a person specifically given the duty by the head
of the law enforcement agency shall notify the superintendent or chief administrative officer of a
juvenile's school of an incident occurring within the agency's jurisdiction if:
    (1) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense that
would be a crime if committed as an adult, that the victim of the offense is a student or staff member
of the school, and that notice to the school is reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim;
or
    (2) the agency has probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed an offense described
in subdivision 3, paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (3), that would be a crime if committed by an adult,
regardless of whether the victim is a student or staff member of the school.
112TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 2008                                       9867

    A law enforcement agency is not required to notify the school under this paragraph if the agency
determines that notice would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. For purposes of this paragraph,
"school" means a public or private elementary, middle, secondary, or charter school.
   (f) In any county in which the county attorney operates or authorizes the operation of a juvenile
prepetition or pretrial diversion program, a law enforcement agency or county attorney's office may
provide the juvenile diversion program with data concerning a juvenile who is a participant in or is
being considered for participation in the program.
   (g) Upon request of a local social services agency, peace officer records of children who are or
may be delinquent or who may be engaged in criminal acts may be disseminated to the agency to
promote the best interests of the subject of the data.
    (h) Upon written request, the prosecuting authority shall release investigative data collected by
a law enforcement agency to the victim of a criminal act or alleged criminal act or to the victim's
legal representative, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph. Data shall not be released if:
   (1) the release to the individual subject of the data would be prohibited under section 13.821; or
   (2) the prosecuting authority reasonably believes:
   (i) that the release of that data will interfere with the investigation; or
    (ii) that the request is prompted by a desire on the part of the requester to engage in unlawful
activities.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 268.19, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Use of data. (a) Except as provided by this section, data gathered from any
person under the administration of the Minnesota Unemployment Insurance Law are private data
on individuals or nonpublic data not on individuals as defined in section 13.02, subdivisions 9 and
12, and may not be disclosed except according to a district court order or section 13.05. A subpoena
is not considered a district court order. These data may be disseminated to and used by the following
agencies without the consent of the subject of the data:
   (1) state and federal agencies specifically authorized access to the data by state or federal law;
   (2) any agency of any other state or any federal agency charged with the administration of an
unemployment insurance program;
    (3) any agency responsible for the maintenance of a system of public employment offices for
the purpose of assisting individuals in obtaining employment;
   (4) the public authority responsible for child support in Minnesota or any other state in
accordance with section 256.978;
   (5) human rights agencies within Minnesota that have enforcement powers;
   (6) the Department of Revenue to the extent necessary for its duties under Minnesota laws;
   (7) public and private agencies responsible for administering publicly financed assistance
programs for the purpose of monitoring the eligibility of the program's recipients;

recipients and former recipients of food stamps or food support, cash assistance under chapter 256,
256D, 256J, or 256K, child care assistance under chapter 119B, or medical programs under chapter

     (c) A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the
business screening agency reasonably determines that the dispute is frivolous, which may be based
on the failure of the subject of the record to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed
record. Upon making a determination that the dispute is frivolous, the business screening service
shall inform the subject of the record of the specific reasons why it has determined that the dispute
is frivolous and provide a description of any information required to investigate the disputed record.
    (d) The business screening service shall notify the subject of the disputed record of the correction
or deletion of the record or of the termination or completion of the investigation related to the record
within 30 days of the date when the agency receives notice of the dispute from the subject of the
record.
    Subd. 4. Date and notice required. A business screening service that disseminates a criminal
record must include the date when the record was collected and a notice that the information may
include records that have been expunged, sealed, or otherwise have become inaccessible to the
public since that date.
    Subd. 5. Remedies; relationship to FCRA. (a) A business screening service that violates this
section is liable to the individual who is the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual
damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable
attorney fees.
    (b) A business screening service in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, United State Code, title 15, section 1681, et seq., is considered to be in compliance

    (c) A subsidiary, joint venture, association, partnership, or other entity that is formed by the

contract terms that make it clear that data created, collected, received, stored, used, maintained,

requirements under chapter 13 as the corporation under this subdivision. However, this section
