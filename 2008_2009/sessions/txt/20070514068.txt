   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.41, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Minneapolis health insurance subsidy. Each year Special School District No. 1,
Minneapolis, may make an additional levy not to exceed the amount raised by a net tax rate of .10
percent times the adjusted net tax capacity for taxes payable in 1991 and thereafter of the property
in the district for the preceding year. The proceeds may be used only to subsidize health insurance
costs for eligible teachers as provided in this section.
    "Eligible teacher" means a retired teacher who is a retired member of the Teachers Retirement
Association, who was a basic member of the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
Association, who retired before May 1, 1974, or who had 20 or more years of basic member service
in the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund Association and retired before June 30, 1983,
and who is not eligible to receive the hospital insurance benefits of the federal Medicare program
of the Social Security Act without payment of a monthly premium. The district must notify eligible
teachers that a subsidy is available. To obtain a subsidy, an eligible teacher must submit to the
school district a copy of receipts for health insurance premiums paid. The district must disburse the
health insurance premium subsidy to each eligible teacher according to a schedule determined by
the district, but at least annually. An eligible teacher may receive a subsidy up to an amount equal
to the lesser of 90 percent of the cost of the eligible teacher's health insurance or up to 90 percent of
the cost of the number two qualified plan of health coverage for individual policies made available
by the Minnesota comprehensive health association under chapter 62E.
    If funds remaining from the previous year's health insurance subsidy levy, minus the previous
year's required subsidy amount, are sufficient to pay the estimated current year subsidy, the levy
must be discontinued until the remaining funds are estimated by the school board to be insufficient
to pay the subsidy.
    This subdivision does not extend benefits to teachers who retire after June 30, 1983, and does
not create a contractual right or claim for altering the benefits in this subdivision. This subdivision
does not restrict the district's right to modify or terminate coverage under this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.01, subdivision 2b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2b. Excluded employees. The following public employees are not eligible to participate
as members of the association with retirement coverage by the public employees retirement plan,
the local government correctional employees retirement plan under chapter 353E, or the public
employees police and fire retirement plan:
    (1) public officers, other than county sheriffs, who are elected to a governing body, or persons
who are appointed to fill a vacancy in an elective office of a governing body, whose term of
office commences on or after July 1, 2002, for the service to be rendered in that elective position.
Elected governing body officials who were active members of the association's coordinated or
basic retirement plans as of June 30, 2002, continue participation throughout incumbency in office
until termination of public service occurs as defined in subdivision 11a;
   (2) election officers or election judges;

    (3) patient and inmate personnel who perform services for a governmental subdivision;

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354.44, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
   Subd. 6. Computation of formula program retirement annuity. (a) The formula retirement
annuity must be computed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formulas stated in
paragraph (b) or (d) on the basis of each member's average salary under section 354.05, subdivision
13a, for the period of the member's formula service credit.
    (b) This paragraph, in conjunction with paragraph (c), applies to a person who first became
a member of the association or a member of a pension fund listed in section 356.30, subdivision
3, before July 1, 1989, unless paragraph (d), in conjunction with paragraph (e), produces a higher
annuity amount, in which case paragraph (d) applies. The average salary as defined in section 354.05,
subdivision 13a, multiplied by the following percentages per year of formula service credit shall
determine the amount of the annuity to which the member qualifying therefor is entitled for service
rendered before July 1, 2006:
                                           Coordinated Member                  Basic Member

     Each year of service thereafter       the percent specified in section    the percent specified
                                           356.315, subdivision 2, per         in section 356.315,

   For service rendered on or after July 1, 2006, the average salary as defined in section 354.05,
subdivision 13a, multiplied by the following percentages per year of service credit, determines the
amount the annuity to which the member qualifying therefor is entitled:

       years of service                   356.315, subdivision 2b, per        in section 356.315,

    (c)(i) This paragraph applies only to a person who first became a member of the association or
a member of a pension fund listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, before July 1, 1989, and whose
annuity is higher when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with this paragraph than when
calculated under paragraph (d), in conjunction with paragraph (e).
   (ii) Where any member retires prior to normal retirement age under a formula annuity, the
member shall be paid a retirement annuity in an amount equal to the normal annuity provided in
paragraph (b) reduced by one-quarter of one percent for each month that the member is under
normal retirement age at the time of retirement except that for any member who has 30 or more
years of allowable service credit, the reduction shall be applied only for each month that the
member is under age 62.
   (iii) Any member whose attained age plus credited allowable service totals 90 years is entitled,
upon application, to a retirement annuity in an amount equal to the normal annuity provided in
paragraph (b), without any reduction by reason of early retirement.
    (d) This paragraph applies to a member who has become at least 55 years old and first became
a member of the association after June 30, 1989, and to any other member who has become at least
55 years old and whose annuity amount when calculated under this paragraph and in conjunction
with paragraph (e), is higher than it is when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with
paragraph (c). For a basic member, the average salary, as defined in section 354.05, subdivision
13a, multiplied by the percent specified by section 356.315, subdivision 4, for each year of service
for a basic member shall determine the amount of the retirement annuity to which the basic member
is entitled. The annuity of a basic member who was a member of the former Minneapolis Teachers
Retirement Fund Association as of June 30, 2006, must be determined according to the annuity
formula under the articles of incorporation of the former Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund
Association in effect as of that date. For a coordinated member, the average salary, as defined in
section 354.05, subdivision 13a, multiplied by the percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision
2, for each year of service rendered before July 1, 2006, and by the percent specified in section
356.315, subdivision 2b, for each year of service rendered on or after July 1, 2006, determines the
amount of the retirement annuity to which the coordinated member is entitled.
    (e) This paragraph applies to a person who has become at least 55 years old and first becomes
a member of the association after June 30, 1989, and to any other member who has become at
least 55 years old and whose annuity is higher when calculated under paragraph (d) in conjunction
with this paragraph than when calculated under paragraph (b), in conjunction with paragraph (c).
An employee who retires under the formula annuity before the normal retirement age shall be paid
the normal annuity provided in paragraph (d) reduced so that the reduced annuity is the actuarial
equivalent of the annuity that would be payable to the employee if the employee deferred receipt of
the annuity and the annuity amount were augmented at an annual rate of three percent compounded
annually from the day the annuity begins to accrue until the normal retirement age if the employee
became an employee before July 1, 2006, and at 2.5 percent compounded annually if the employee

becomes an employee after June 30, 2006.
    (f) No retirement annuity is payable to a former employee with a salary that exceeds 95 percent of
the governor's salary unless and until the salary figures used in computing the highest five successive
years average salary under paragraph (a) have been audited by the Teachers Retirement Association
and determined by the executive director to comply with the requirements and limitations of section
354.05, subdivisions 35 and 35a.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactive to July 1, 2006.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354A.12, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Special direct state matching aid to the Teachers Retirement Association. (a)
Special School District No. 1 must make an additional employer contribution to the Teachers
Retirement Fund Association. The city of Minneapolis must make a contribution to the Teachers
Retirement Association. This contribution must be made by a levy of the board of estimate and

Minneapolis, and the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association shall jointly certify
to the commissioner of finance the total amount that has been contributed by Special School District
No. 1 and by the city of Minneapolis to the Teachers Retirement Association. Any certification to
the commissioner of education must be made quarterly. If the total certifications for a fiscal year
exceed the maximum annual direct state matching aid amount in any quarter, the amount of direct
state matching aid payable to the Teachers Retirement Association must be limited to the balance
of the maximum annual direct state matching aid amount available. The amount required under this
paragraph, subject to the maximum direct state matching aid amount, is appropriated annually to
the commissioner of finance.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 3A.02, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Qualifications. (a) A former legislator is entitled, upon written application to the
director, to receive a retirement allowance monthly, if the person:
   (1) has either served at least six full years, without regard to the application of section 3A.10,
subdivision 2, or has served during all or part of four regular sessions as a member of the legislature,
which service need not be continuous;
   (2) has attained the normal retirement age;
   (3) has retired as a member of the legislature; and
   (4) has made all contributions provided for in section 3A.03, has made payments for past service

under subdivision 2, or has made payments in lieu of contributions under Minnesota Statutes 1992,
section 3A.031, before July 1, 1994.
    (b) Unless the former legislator has legislative service before January 1, 1979, the retirement
allowance is an amount equal to 2-1/2 percent per year of service of that member's average
monthly salary and adjusted for that person on an actuarial equivalent basis to reflect the change
in the postretirement interest rate actuarial assumption under section 356.215, subdivision 8, from
five percent to six percent. The adjustment must be calculated by or, alternatively, the adjustment
procedure must be specified by, the actuary retained under section 356.214. The purpose of this
adjustment is to ensure that the total amount of benefits that the actuary predicts an individual
member will receive over the member's lifetime under this paragraph will be the same as the total
amount of benefits the actuary predicts the individual member would receive over the member's
lifetime under the law in effect before enactment of this paragraph. If the former legislator has
legislative service before January 1, 1979, the person's benefit must include the additional benefit
amount in effect on January 1, 1979, and adjusted as otherwise provided in this paragraph.

  Sec. 5. [352.017] AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE SERVICE CREDIT PURCHASE
PROCEDURE.
    Subdivision 1. Application. Except for leaves or breaks in service covered by section 352.27 or
352.275, this section applies to all plans specified in this chapter for any period of authorized leave
of absence without pay that does not exceed one year and for which the employee obtains credit for
allowable service by making payment as specified in this section to the applicable fund.
    Subd. 2. Purchase procedure. (a) An employee covered by a plan specified in this chapter
may purchase credit for allowable service in that plan for a period specified in subdivision 1 if the
employee makes a payment as specified in paragraph (b) or (c), whichever applies. The employing
unit, at its option, may pay the employer portion of the amount specified in paragraph (b) on behalf
of its employees.
    (b) If payment is received by the executive director within one year from the end of the authorized
leave, the payment amount is equal to the employee and employer contribution rates specified in
law for the applicable plan at the end of the leave period multiplied by the employee's hourly rate
of salary on the date of return from the leave of absence and by the days and months of the leave of
absence for which the employee wants allowable service credit. Payments made under this paragraph
must include compound interest at a monthly rate of 0.71 percent from the last day of the leave period
until the last day of the month in which payment is received.
  (c) If payment is received by the executive director after one year, the payment amount is the
amount determined under section 356.551.

   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 352.27, is amended to read:
   352.27 CREDIT FOR BREAK IN SERVICE TO PROVIDE UNIFORMED SERVICE.
    (a) An employee who is absent from employment by reason of service in the uniformed services,
as defined in United States Code, title 38, section 4303(13), and who returns to state service upon
discharge from service in the uniformed service within the time frames required in United States
Code, title 38, section 4312(e), may obtain service credit for the period of the uniformed service as
further specified in this section, provided that the employee did not separate from uniformed service
with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions.
    (b) The employee may obtain credit by paying into the fund an equivalent employee
contribution based upon the contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed
service was performed multiplied by the full and fractional years being purchased and applied
to the annual salary rate. The annual salary rate is the average annual salary during the purchase
period that the employee would have received if the employee had continued to be employed in
covered employment rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination of that
rate is not reasonably certain, the annual salary rate is the employee's average salary rate during
the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period of the
uniformed service.
    (c) The equivalent employer contribution and, if applicable, the equivalent additional employer
contribution provided in ­ s­

at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied to the same annual salary rate or rates
used to compute the equivalent employee contribution.
    (d) If the employee equivalent contributions provided in this section are not paid in full, the
employee's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full and fractional number
of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained by dividing the total
employee contribution received by the total employee contribution otherwise required under this
section.
    (e) To receive service credit under this section, the contributions specified in this section must be
transmitted to the Minnesota State Retirement System during the period which begins with the date
on which the individual returns to state service and which has a duration of three times the length of
the uniformed service period, but not to exceed five years. If the determined payment period is less
than one year, the contributions required under this section to receive service credit may be made
within one year of the discharge date.
   (f) The amount of service credit obtainable under this section may not exceed five years unless

a longer purchase period is required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312.
    (g) The employing unit shall pay interest on all equivalent employee and employer contribution
amounts payable under this section. Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5 percent compounded
annually from the end of each fiscal year of the leave or the break in service to the end of the month
in which the payment is received.

who has received the maximum service credit allowed for an authorized temporary or seasonal
layoff must return to public service and must obtain a minimum of three months of allowable service
subsequent to the layoff in order to receive allowable service for a subsequent authorized temporary
or seasonal layoff; or
    (7) a period during which a member is absent from employment by a governmental subdivision
by reason of service in the uniformed services, as defined in United States Code, title 38, section
4303(13), if the member returns to public service upon discharge from service in the uniformed
service within the time frames required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312(e), provided
that the member did not separate from uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct
discharge or under other than honorable conditions. The service is credited if the member pays into
the fund equivalent employee contributions based upon the contribution rate or rates in effect at
the time that the uniformed service was performed multiplied by the full and fractional years being
purchased and applied to the annual salary rate. The annual salary rate is the average annual salary
during the purchase period that the member would have received if the member had continued to be
employed in covered employment rather than to provide uniformed service, or, if the determination
of that rate is not reasonably certain, the annual salary rate is the member's average salary rate
during the 12-month period of covered employment rendered immediately preceding the period
of the uniformed service. Payment of the member equivalent contributions must be made during
a period that begins with the date on which the individual returns to public employment and that
is three times the length of the military leave period, or within five years of the date of discharge
from the military service, whichever is less. If the determined payment period is less than one year,
the contributions required under this clause to receive service credit may be made within one year
of the discharge date. Payment may not be accepted following 20 days after termination of public
service under subdivision 11a. If the member equivalent contributions provided for in this clause
are not paid in full, the member's allowable service credit must be prorated by multiplying the full
and fractional number of years of uniformed service eligible for purchase by the ratio obtained
by dividing the total member contributions received by the total member contributions otherwise
required under this clause. The equivalent employer contribution, and, if applicable, the equivalent
additional employer contribution must be paid by the governmental subdivision employing the
member if the member makes the equivalent employee contributions. The employer payments must
be made from funds available to the employing unit, using the employer and additional employer
contribution rate or rates in effect at the time that the uniformed service was performed, applied
to the same annual salary rate or rates used to compute the equivalent member contribution. The

governmental subdivision involved may appropriate money for those payments. The amount of
service credit obtainable under this section may not exceed five years unless a longer purchase
period is required under United States Code, title 38, section 4312. The employing unit shall pay
interest on all equivalent member and employer contribution amounts payable under this clause.
Interest must be computed at a rate of 8.5 percent compounded annually from the end of each fiscal
year of the leave or the break in service to the end of the month in which the payment is received.
Upon payment, the employee must be granted allowable service credit for the purchased period.
    (b) For calculating benefits under sections 353.30, 353.31, 353.32, and 353.33 for state officers
and employees displaced by the Community Corrections Act, chapter 401, and transferred into
county service under section 401.04, "allowable service" means the combined years of allowable
service as defined in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (6), and section 352.01, subdivision 11.
     (c) For a public employee who has prior service covered by a local police or firefighters relief
association that has consolidated with the Public Employees Retirement Association or to which
section 353.665 applies, and who has elected the type of benefit coverage provided by the public
employees police and fire fund either under section 353A.08 following the consolidation or under
section 353.665, subdivision 4, "applicable service" is a period of service credited by the local police
or firefighters relief association as of the effective date of the consolidation based on law and on
bylaw provisions governing the relief association on the date of the initiation of the consolidation
procedure.
   (d) No member may receive more than 12 months of allowable service credit in a year either for
vesting purposes or for benefit calculation purposes.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, and applies to authorized leaves of
absence that commence on or after that date.
      Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.01, subdivision 28, is amended to read:
    Subd. 28. Retirement. (a) "Retirement" means the commencement of the payment of an annuity
based on a date designated by the board of trustees. This date determines the rights under this chapter
which occur either before or after retirement. A right to retirement is subject to termination of public
service under subdivision 11a. A right to retirement requires a complete and continuous separation
for 30 days from employment as a public employee and from the provision of paid services to that
employer.
    (b) An individual who separates from employment as a public employee and who, within 30 days
of separation, returns to provide service to a governmental subdivision as an independent contractor
or as an employee of an independent contractor, has not satisfied the separation requirements under
paragraph (a).

  Sec. 18. [353.0161] AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE SERVICE CREDIT
PURCHASE PROCEDURE.
    Subdivision 1. Application. This section applies to employees covered by any plan specified
in this chapter or chapter 353E for any period of authorized leave of absence specified in section
353.01, subdivision 16, paragraph (a), clause (4), for which the employee obtains credit for allowable
service by making payment as specified in this section to the applicable fund.
    Subd. 2. Purchase procedure. (a) An employee covered by a plan specified in subdivision 1
may purchase credit for allowable service in that plan for a period specified in subdivision 1 if the
employee makes a payment as specified in paragraph (b) or (c), whichever applies. The employing
unit, at its option, may pay the employer portion of the amount specified in paragraph (b) on behalf
of its employees.
    (b) If payment is received by the executive director within one year from the end of the authorized
leave, the payment amount is equal to the employee and employer contribution rates specified in
law for the applicable plan at the end of the leave period multiplied by the employee's hourly rate
of salary on the date of return from the leave of absence and by the days and months of the leave of
absence for which the employee wants allowable service credit. Payments made under this paragraph
must include compound interest at a monthly rate of 0.71 percent from the last day of the leave period
until the last day of the month in which payment is received.
  (c) If payment is received by the executive director after one year, the payment amount is the
amount determined under section 356.551.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, and applies to authorized leaves of

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.27, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 14. Treatment of periods before initial coverage date. (a) If an entity is determined to be
a governmental subdivision due to receipt of a written notice of eligibility from the association, that
employer and its employees are subject to the requirements of subdivision 12, effective retroactive to
the date that the executive director of the association determines that the entity first met the definition
of a governmental subdivision, if that date predates the notice of eligibility.
   (b) If the retroactive time period under paragraph (a) exceeds three years, an employee is
authorized to purchase service credit in the applicable Public Employees Retirement Association
plan for the portion of the period in excess of three years, by making payment under section
356.551.
    (c) This subdivision does not apply if the applicable employment under paragraph (a) included
coverage by any public or private defined benefit or defined contribution retirement plan, other than
a volunteer firefighters relief association. If this paragraph applies, an individual is prohibited from
purchasing service credit for any period or periods specified in paragraph (a).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
initial plan coverage dates occurring on or after that date.
   Sec. 23. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.28, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Collection of unpaid amounts. (a) If a governmental subdivision which receives the
direct proceeds of property taxation fails to pay an amount due under chapter 353, 353A, 353B,
353C, or 353D, the executive director shall certify the amount to the governmental subdivision
for payment. If the governmental subdivision fails to remit the sum so due in a timely fashion,
the executive director shall certify the amount to the applicable county auditor for collection. The
county auditor shall collect the amount out of the revenue of the governmental subdivision, or
shall add the amount to the levy of the governmental subdivision and make payment directly to
the association. This tax must be levied, collected, and apportioned in the manner that other taxes
are levied, collected, and apportioned.
    (b) If a governmental subdivision which is not funded directly from the proceeds of property
taxation fails to pay an amount due under this chapter, the executive director shall certify the
amount to the governmental subdivision for payment. If the governmental subdivision fails to
pay the amount for a period of 60 days after the date of the certification, the executive director
shall certify the amount to the commissioner of finance, who shall deduct the amount from
any subsequent state-aid payment or state appropriation amount applicable to the governmental
subdivision and make payment directly to the association. If the amount of the state-aid payment
or state appropriation is not sufficient to pay the full sum due, the amounts paid to the association
must be applied first to the unpaid employee deductions withheld from the employees' wages and
next to the unpaid employer contributions. Any remaining amount received by the association must
be applied to the interest due on the employee and employer contribution amounts. If a government
subdivision under this paragraph owes amounts to more than one public retirement plan, section
356.98 applies.
   (c) If a governmental subdivision has been dissolved or closed, the requirements in paragraph

(b) of a certification to the governmental subdivision and the related 60-day waiting period do not
apply. The executive director is authorized to immediately certify the applicable amount to the
commissioner of finance.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.29, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the monthly surviving spouse
optional annuity if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the
association. If there is no surviving spouse or child or children, a former spouse may be entitled to
a lump-sum refund payment under subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution decree,
but not a monthly surviving spouse optional annuity, despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (e) The surviving spouse eligible for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (a) may apply
for the annuity at any time after the date on which the deceased employee would have attained the
required age for retirement based on the employee's allowable service. The surviving spouse eligible
for surviving spouse benefits under paragraph (b) or (c) may apply for an annuity any time after the
member's death. T      ­h

    (i) If the deceased member or former member first became a public employee or a member of a
public pension plan listed in section 356.30, subdivision 3, on or after July 1, 1989, a survivor annuity
computed under paragraph (a) or (c) must be computed as specified in section 353.30, subdivision
5, except for the revised early retirement reduction specified in paragraph (c), if paragraph (c) is the
applicable provision.
    (j) For any survivor annuity determined under this subdivision, the payment is to be based on
the total allowable service that the member had accrued as of the date of death and the age of the
member and surviving spouse on that date.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for survivor benefits based on a date of death
occurring on or after July 1, 2007. This section is not intended to increase, modify, impair, or
diminish the benefit entitlements specified in the subdivision within the Minnesota Statutes being
amended. If the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association determines
that any provision of this section does increase, modify, impair, or diminish the benefit entitlements
as reflected in applicable law just before the effective date of this section, the executive director
shall certify that determination and a recommendation as to the required legislative correction to
the chairs of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement, the house of representatives
Governmental Operations, Reform, Technology and Elections Committee, the senate State and
Local Government Operations and Oversight Committee, and to the executive director of the
Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement.

     Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354.35, is amended to read:
  354.35 OPTIONAL ACCELERATED RETIREMENT ANNUITY BEFORE NORMAL
RETIREMENT AGE.
    Subdivision 1. Normal retirement age definition. For purposes of this section, "normal
retirement age" means normal retirement age as defined in United States Code, title 42, section
416(1), as amended.
    Subd. 2. Election of accelerated annuity. (a) Any coordinated member who retires before
normal retirement age 6  ­5­ may elect to receive an optional accelerated retirement annuity from the
association which provides for different annuity amounts over different periods of retirement. The
optional accelerated retirement annuity must take the form of an annuity payable for the period
before the member attains age 65, or normal retirement age, in a greater amount than the amount of
the annuity calculated under section 354.44 on the basis of the age of the member at retirement, but
the optional accelerated retirement annuity must be the actuarial equivalent of the member's annuity
computed on the basis of the member's age at retirement. The greater amount must be paid until the
retiree reaches age 65, or normal retirement age, and at that time the payment from the association
must be reduced. For each year the retiree is under age 65, or normal retirement age, up to five
percent of the total life annuity required reserves may be used to accelerate the optional retirement
annuity under this section. A ­­

accrue;

attains normal retirement age at the rate of three percent;

    (d
     ­­) (4) annuity purchase rates based on an appropriate annuity table of mortality established
by the board as provided in section 354.07, subdivision 1, and using the applicable postretirement
interest rate assumption specified in section 356.215, subdivision 8.
    (c) In addition, a supplementary monthly benefit of $25 to age 65 or the five-year anniversary
of the effective date of the disability benefit, whichever is later, must be paid to basic members.

     ­­) (d) The disability benefit granted to members covered under section 354.44, subdivision 6,
shall be computed in the same manner as the annuity provided in section 354.44, subdivision 6. The
disability benefit shall be the formula annuity without the reduction for each month the member is
under normal retirement age when the benefit begins to accrue as defined by the law in effect on the
last day for which salary is paid.
    ­
    (3
     ­­) (e) For the purposes of computing a retirement annuity when the member becomes eligible,
the amounts paid for disability benefits shall not be deducted from the individual member's
accumulated deductions. If the disability benefits provided in this subdivision exceed the monthly
average salary of the disabled member, the disability benefits shall be reduced to an amount equal
to the disabled member's average salary.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.
   Sec. 40. [354.471] ACCOUNT TERMINATION; RESTORATION.
   Subdivision 1. Account termination. If an active or deferred member dies and there is no
surviving spouse or other beneficiaries, or the spouse or beneficiaries cannot be located within five
years of the date of death of the member, the accumulated employee and employer contributions
and any other payments made to the Teachers Retirement Association fund by the individual or
on behalf of the individual, and all investment earnings on these amounts, must be credited to and
become part of the retirement fund.
    Subd. 2. Restoration. Following a forfeiture under subdivision 1, if a surviving spouse or
other beneficiary of the deceased contacts the Teachers Retirement Association and, based on
documentation determined by the executive director to be valid and adequate, establishes a right
to a survivor annuity, death refund, or other benefit provided by this chapter, the account forfeited
under subdivision 1 must be fully or partially restored, as necessary.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.
  Sec. 41. [354.72] AUTHORIZED LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND STRIKE PERIOD
SERVICE CREDIT PURCHASE PROCEDURE.
    Subdivision 1. Application. This section applies to any strike period under section 354.05,
subdivision 13, clause (9), and to any period of authorized leave of absence without pay under
sections 354.093, 354.094, 354.095, and 354.096 for which the teacher obtains credit for allowable
service by making payment as specified in this section to the Teachers Retirement Association fund.
Each year of an extended leave of absence under section 354.094 is considered to be a separate leave
for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 2. Purchase procedure. (a) A teacher may purchase credit for allowable and formula
service in the plan for a period specified in subdivision 1 if the teacher makes a payment as specified
in paragraph (b) or (c), whichever applies. The employing unit, at its option, may pay the employer
portion of the amount specified in paragraph (b) on behalf of its employees.
    (b) If payment is received by the executive director within one year from the end of the strike
period or authorized leave under section 354.093, 354.095, or 354.096, or after June 30 and before
the following June 30 for an extended leave of absence under section 354.094, the payment must
equal the total employee and employer contributions, including amortization contributions if
applicable, given the contribution rates in section 354.42, multiplied by the member's average
monthly salary rate on the commencement of the leave or period of strike, multiplied by the months
and portions of a month of the leave of absence or period of strike for which the teacher seeks
allowable service credit. Payments made under this paragraph must include compound interest at a
monthly rate of 0.71 percent from the last day of the leave period or strike period, or from June 30
for an extended leave of absence under section 354.094, until the last day of the month in which
payment is received.
   (c) If payment is received by the executive director after the applicable last permitted date under
paragraph (b), the payment amount is the amount determined under section 356.551.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, and applies to authorized leaves of
absence that commence on or after that date.

individual elects straight life annuities from both systems. The total payment must be equal to the
amount that is payable if payments were kept separate. T  ­­

credit for that period of uncovered prior subsidized public employment, other than a period of prior
subsidized public employment for which a repayment of a refund was made, with a public pension
plan specified in subdivision 1, clause (3), which, except for the exclusion provided by Laws 1978,
chapter 720, would have provided pension coverage for the subsidized employment.
   Subd. 3. Procedures. Section 356.551 applies to purchases under this section, except that
payment must be made before the expiration date of this section or termination from eligible
employment covered by a pension plan under subdivision 1, clause (1), whichever is earlier.

   Sec. 46. [356.98] ALLOCATION OF RECEIVABLES.
     If an employing unit is dissolved or closed and amounts are owed to more than one Minnesota
public pension plan, any amounts available to cover payments to the plans must be applied first to the
employee contributions owed to the applicable plans, and next to the unpaid employer contributions,
including any applicable employer additional contributions, and finally to the interest due on the
employee and employer amounts. If, at any stage in this allocation process, the available amount
is insufficient to fully cover the amount required, the remaining available payment amount must be
prorated among the applicable plans based on each plan's share of combined covered payroll.

  Sec. 5. [352.955] TRANSFER OF PRIOR MSRS-GENERAL SERVICE CREDIT FOR
CERTAIN EMPLOYEES WITH TRANSFERRED RETIREMENT COVERAGE.
  Subdivision 1. Election to transfer prior MSRS-general service credit. (a) An eligible
employee described in paragraph (b) may elect to transfer service credit in the general state
employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System to the correctional state
employees retirement plan for eligible prior correctional employment.
    (b) An eligible employee is a person who is covered by section 6 or who became eligible for
retirement coverage by the correctional state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State
Retirement System under Laws 2006, chapter 271, article 2, this article, or legislation implementing
the recommendations under section 352.91, subdivision 4a.
    (c) Eligible prior correctional employment is covered correctional service defined in section
6 or is employment by the Department of Corrections or by the Department of Human Services
that preceded the effective date of the retirement coverage transfer under Laws 2006, chapter
271, article 2, this article, or legislation implementing the recommendations under section 352.91,
subdivision 4a, is continuous service, and is certified by the commissioner of corrections and
the commissioner of human services, whichever applies, and by the commissioner of employee
relations to the executive director of the Minnesota State Retirement System as service that would
qualify for correctional state employees retirement plan coverage under section 352.91, if the
service was rendered after the date of coverage transfer.
    (d) The election to transfer past service credit under this section must be made in writing by the
applicable person on a form prescribed by the executive director of the Minnesota State Retirement
System and must be filed with the executive director of the Minnesota State Retirement System on
or before (1) January 1, 2008, or the one year anniversary of the coverage transfer, whichever is later,
or (2) the date of the eligible employee's termination of state employment, whichever is earlier.
    Subd. 2. Payment of additional equivalent contributions; pre-July 1, 2007, coverage
transfers. (a) An eligible employee who was transferred to plan coverage before July 1, 2007,
and who elects to transfer past service credit under this section must pay an additional member
contribution for that prior service period. The additional member contribution is the difference
between the member contribution rate or rates for the general state employees retirement plan of
the Minnesota State Retirement System for the period of employment covered by the service credit
to be transferred and the member contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees
retirement plan for the period of employment covered by the service credit to be transferred, plus
annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent.
    (b) The additional equivalent member contribution under this subdivision must be paid in a lump
sum. Payment must accompany the election to transfer the prior service credit. No transfer election
or additional equivalent member contribution payment may be made by a person or accepted by the
executive director after January 1, 2008, or the date on which the eligible employee terminates state
employment, whichever is earlier.
   (c) If an eligible employee elects to transfer past service credit under this section and pays the
additional equivalent member contribution amount under paragraphs (a) and (b), the applicable
department shall pay an additional equivalent employer contribution amount. The additional
employer contribution is the difference between the employer contribution rate or rates for the
general state employees retirement plan for the period of employment covered by the service credit

to be transferred and the employer contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees
retirement plan for the period of employment covered by the service credit to be transferred, plus
annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent.
    (d) The additional equivalent employer contribution under this subdivision must be paid in a
lump sum and must be paid within 30 days of the date on which the executive director of the
Minnesota State Retirement System certifies to the applicable department that the employee paid
the additional equivalent member contribution.
    Subd. 3. Payment of additional equivalent contributions; post-June 30, 2007, coverage
transfers. (a) An eligible employee who was transferred to plan coverage after June 30, 2007,
and who elects to transfer past service credit under this section must pay an additional member
contribution for that prior service period. The additional member contribution is (1) the difference
between the member contribution rate or rates for the general state employees retirement plan of
the Minnesota State Retirement System for the period of employment covered by the service credit
to be transferred and the member contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees
retirement plan for the most recent 12 month period of employment covered by the service credit
to be transferred, plus annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent, and (2) 40 percent of the
unfunded actuarial accrued liability attributable to the past service credit transfer. The unfunded
actuarial accrued liability attributable to the past service credit transfer is the present value of the
benefit obtained by the transfer of the service credit to the correctional state employees retirement
plan reduced by the amount of the asset transfer under subdivision 4, by the amount of the member
contribution equivalent payment under clause (1), and by the amount of the employer contribution
equivalent payment under paragraph (c), clause (1).
    (b) The additional equivalent member contribution under this subdivision must be paid in a lump
sum. Payment must accompany the election to transfer the prior service credit. No transfer election
or additional equivalent member contribution payment may be made by a person or accepted by the
executive director after the one year anniversary date of the effective date of the retirement coverage
transfer, or the date on which the eligible employee terminates state employment, whichever is
earlier.
    (c) If an eligible employee elects to transfer past service credit under this section and pays the
additional equivalent member contribution amount under subdivision 2, the applicable department
shall pay an additional equivalent employer contribution amount. The additional employer
contribution is (1) the difference between the employer contribution rate or rates for the general
state employees retirement plan for the period of employment covered by the service credit to
be transferred and the employer contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees
retirement plan for the period of employment covered by the service credit to be transferred, plus
annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent, and (2) 60 percent of the unfunded actuarial
accrued liability attributable to the past service credit transfer calculated as provided in paragraph
(a), clause (2).
    (d) The additional equivalent employer contribution under this subdivision must be paid in a
lump sum and must be paid within 30 days of the date on which the executive director of the
Minnesota State Retirement System certifies to the applicable department that the employee paid
the additional equivalent member contribution.

employee must be transferred from the general state employees retirement fund to the correctional
state employees retirement fund in an amount equal to the present value of benefits earned under
the general state employees retirement plan by the eligible employee transferring past service to the
correctional state employees retirement plan, as determined by the actuary retained under section
356.214, multiplied by the accrued liability funding ratio of the active members of the general
state employees retirement plan as derived from the most recent actuarial valuation prepared under
section 356.215. The transfer of assets must be made within 45 days after the coverage transfer
election is made.
    Subd. 5. Effect of the asset transfer. Upon the transfer of assets under subdivision 4, the service
credit in the general state employees retirement plan of the Minnesota State Retirement System is
forfeited and may not be reinstated. The transferred service credit and the transferred assets must
be credited to the correctional state employees retirement plan and fund, respectively.
    Subd. 6. Cost of actuarial calculations. The applicable department shall pay the cost of the
actuarial calculations required by this section as billed by the executive director of the Minnesota
State Retirement System.

   Sec. 6. COVERAGE FOR PRIOR STATE SERVICE FOR CERTAIN PERSONS.
    (a) An employee who has retirement coverage for past correctional service transferred to the
correctional state employees retirement plan under paragraph (b) is entitled to elect to obtain prior
service credit for eligible state service performed as a stores clerk after April 24, 1990, and before
September 8, 1994, with the Department of Corrections. All eligible prior service credit must be

correctional service retirement plan and any other disability determination subject to approval by
the board, except as otherwise specified in section 353.33, 353.656, or 353E.05. These requirements
and the requirements of section 353.03, subdivision 3, are in addition to the specific requirements
of each plan and govern in the event there is any conflict between these sections and the procedures
specific to any of those plans under section 353.33, 353.656, or 353E.06.
    Subd. 2. Plan document policy statement. Disability determinations for the public employees
general fund must be made subject to section 353.01, subdivision 19; and for the police and fire
plan and the local government correctional service retirement plan must be made consistent with
the legislative policy and intent set forth in section 353.63.
   Subd. 3. Procedure to determine eligibility; generally. (a) Every claim for a disability
benefit must be initiated in writing on an application form and in the manner prescribed by the
executive director and filed with the executive director. An application for disability benefits must
be made within 18 months following termination of public service as defined under section 353.01,
subdivision 11a.
    (b) All medical reports must support a finding that the disability arose before the employee was
placed on any paid or unpaid leave of absence or terminated public service, as defined under section
353.01, subdivision 11a.
    (c) An applicant for disability shall provide a detailed report signed by a licensed medical
doctor and at least one additional report signed by a medical doctor, psychologist, or chiropractor.
The applicant shall authorize the release of all medical and health care evidence, including all
medical records and relevant information from any source, to support the application for initial,
or the continuing payment of, disability benefits.
    (d) All reports must contain an opinion regarding the claimant's prognosis, the duration of the
disability, and the expectations for improvement. Any report that does not contain and support a
finding that the disability will last for at least one year may not be relied upon to support eligibility
for benefits.
    (e) Where the medical evidence supports the expectation that at some point in time the claimant
will no longer be disabled, any decision granting disability may provide for a termination date
4042                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [68TH DAY

upon which disability can be expected to no longer exist. In the event a termination date is made
part of the decision granting benefits, prior to the actual termination of benefits, the claimant shall
have the opportunity to show that the disabling condition for which benefits were initially granted
continues. In the event the benefits terminate in accordance with the original decision, the claimant
may petition for a review by the board of trustees under section 353.03, subdivision 3, or may
reapply for disability in accordance with these procedures and section 353.33, 353.656, or 353E.06,
as applicable.
    (f) Any claim to disability must be supported by a report from the employer indicating that there
is no available work that the employee can perform in the employee's disabled condition and that
all reasonable accommodations have been considered. Upon request of the executive director, an
employer shall provide evidence of the steps the employer has taken to attempt to provide reasonable
accommodations and continued employment to the claimant. The employer shall also provide a
certification of the member's past public service; the dates of any paid sick leave, vacation, or any
other employer-paid salary continuation plan beyond the last working day; and whether or not any
sick or annual leave has been allowed.
    (g) An employee who is placed on leave of absence without compensation because of a disability
is not barred from receiving a disability benefit.
    (h) An applicant for disability benefits may file a retirement annuity application under section
353.29, subdivision 4, simultaneously with an application for disability benefits. If the application
for disability benefits is approved, the retirement annuity application is cancelled. If disability
benefits are denied, the retirement annuity application must be processed upon the request of the
applicant. No member of the public employees general plan, the public employees police and fire
plan, or the local government correctional service retirement plan may receive a disability benefit
and a retirement annuity simultaneously from the same plan.
    Subd. 4. Additional requirements to determine eligibility for police and fire or local
government correctional service plan disability benefits. (a) If an application for disability
benefits is filed within two years of the date of the injury or the onset of the illness that gave rise
to the disability application, the application must be supported by evidence that the applicant is
unable to perform the duties of the position held by the applicant on the date of the injury or the
onset of the illness causing the disability. The employer must provide evidence indicating whether
the applicant is able or unable to perform the duties of the position held on the date of the injury
or onset of the illness causing the disability and the specifications of any duties that the individual
can or cannot perform.
    (b) If an application for disability benefits is filed more than two years after the date of injury or
the onset of an illness causing the disability, the application must be supported by evidence that
the applicant is unable to perform the most recent duties that are expected to be performed by
the applicant during the 90 days before the filing of the application. The employer must provide
evidence of the duties that are expected to be performed by the applicant during the 90 days before
the filing of the application, whether the applicant can or cannot perform those duties overall, and
the specifications of any duties that the applicant can or cannot perform.
    (c) Any report supporting a claim to disability benefits under section 353.656 or 353E.06 must
specifically relate the disability to its cause; and for any claim to duty disability from an injury or
illness arising out of an act of duty, the report must relate the cause of disability to specific tasks

or functions required to be performed by the employee in fulfilling the employee's duty-related acts
which must be specific to the inherent dangers of the positions eligible for membership in the police
and fire fund and the local government correctional service retirement plan. Any report that does
not relate the cause of disability to specific acts or functions performed by the employee may not be
relied upon as evidence to support eligibility for benefits and may be disregarded in the executive
director's decision-making process.
    (d) Any application for duty disability must be supported by a first report of injury as defined in
section 176.231.
    (e) If a member who has applied for and been approved for disability benefits before the
termination of service does not terminate service or is not placed on an authorized leave of absence
as certified by the governmental subdivision within 45 days following the date on which the
application is approved, the application shall be canceled. If an approved application for disability
benefits has been canceled, a subsequent application for disability benefits may not be filed on
the basis of the same medical condition for a minimum of one year from the date on which the
previous application was canceled.
    Subd. 5. Medical adviser. The executive director may contract with licensed physicians or
physicians on the staff of the state commissioner of health, as designated by the commissioner,
to be the medical adviser of the association. The medical adviser shall review all medical reports
submitted to the association, including the findings of an independent medical examination
requested under this section, and shall advise the executive director.
   Subd. 6. Independent medical examination. Any individual applying for or receiving disability
benefits must submit to an independent medical examination if requested by the executive director.
The medical examination must be paid for by the association.
    Subd. 7. Refusal of examination or medical evidence. If a person applying for or receiving a
disability benefit refuses to submit to a medical examination under subdivision 6, or fails to provide
or to authorize the release of medical evidence under subdivision 3, the association shall cease the
application process or shall discontinue the payment of a disability benefit, whichever is applicable.
Upon the receipt of the requested medical evidence, the association shall resume the application
process or the payment of a disability benefit upon approval for the continuation, whichever is
applicable.
   Subd. 8. Proof of continuing disability. (a) A disability benefit payment must not be made
except upon adequate proof furnished to the executive director of the association that the person
remains disabled.
   (b) During the time when disability benefits are being paid, the executive director of the
association has the right, at reasonable times, to require the disabled member to submit proof of the
continuance of the disability claimed.
    (c) Adequate proof of a disability must include a written expert report by a licensed physician,
a licensed chiropractor, or, with respect to a mental impairment, a licensed psychologist.
   Subd. 9. Application approval or denial; decision of executive director. Any decision of the
executive director is final, except that a member whose application for disability benefits or whose
continuation of disability benefits is denied may appeal the executive director's decision to the board

of trustees within 60 days of receipt of a certified letter notifying the member of the decision to deny
the application or continuation of benefits. In developing the record for review by the board when a
decision is appealed, the executive director may direct that the applicant participate in a fact-finding
session conducted by an administrative law judge assigned by the Office of Administrative Hearings,
and, as applicable, a vocational assessment conducted by the qualified rehabilitation counselor on
contract with the Public Employees Retirement Association.
    Subd. 10. Restoring forfeited service. To restore forfeited service, a repayment of a refund must
be made within six months after the effective date of disability benefits or within six months after
the date of the filing of the disability application, whichever is later. No purchase of prior service or
payment made in lieu of salary deductions otherwise authorized under section 353.01 may be made
after the occurrence of the disability for which an application is filed under this section.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.

      (b) To be eligible for a benefit under paragraph (a), the member must have:
      (1) not met the requirements for a retirement annuity under section 353.651, subdivision 1; or
    (2) met the requirements under that subdivision, but does not have at least 20 years of allowable
service credit.
    (c) If paragraph (b), clause (2), applies, the disability benefit must be paid for a period of 60
months from the disability benefit accrual date and at the end of that period is subject to provisions
of subdivision 5a.
    (d) If the disability under this subdivision occurs before the member has at least five years of
allowable service credit in the police and fire plan, the disability benefit must be computed on the
­
"average salary" ­ from which deductions were made for contribution to the police and fire fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, and applies to disability benefit
applicants whose last day of public employment was after June 30, 2007.
      Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.656, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1a. Total and permanent duty disability; computation of benefits. (a) A member of
the police and fire plan whose disabling condition is determined to be a duty disability that is also a
permanent and total disability as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 19, is entitled to receive, for
life, disability benefits in an amount equal to 60 percent of the average salary as defined in section
353.01, subdivision 17a, plus an additional percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision 6, of
that average salary for each year of service in excess of 20 years.
    (b) A disability benefit payable under paragraph (a) is subject to eligibility review under
section 353.33, subdivision 6, but the review may be waived if the executive director receives a
written statement from the association's medical advisor that no improvement can be expected in
the member's disabling condition that was the basis for payment of the benefit under paragraph
(a). A member receiving a disability benefit under this subdivision who is found to no longer be
permanently and totally disabled as defined under section 353.01, subdivision 19, but continues to
meet the definition for receipt of a duty disability under section 353.01, subdivision 41, is subject
to subdivision 1 under this section upon written notice from the association's medical advisor that
the person is no longer considered permanently and totally disabled.
   (c) If a member approved for disability benefits under this subdivision dies before attaining
normal retirement age as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 37, paragraph (b), or within 60

months of the effective date of the disability, whichever is later, the surviving spouse is entitled
to receive a survivor benefit under section 353.657, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (1), if the
death is the direct result of the disabling condition for which disability benefits were approved, or
section 353.657, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (2) if the death is not directly related to the
disabling condition for which benefits were approved under this subdivision.
    (d) If the election of an actuarial equivalent optional annuity is not made at the time the
permanent and total disability benefit accrues, an election must be made within 90 days before the
member attains normal retirement age as defined under section 353.01, subdivision 37, paragraph
(b) or having collected total and permanent disability benefits for 60 months, whichever is later. If
a member receiving disability benefits who has dependent children dies, subdivision 6a, paragraph
(c) applies.

   (1) not met the requirements for a retirement annuity under section 353.651, subdivision 1, or
    (2) met the requirements under that subdivision, but does not have at least 15 years of allowable
service credit.
    (c) If paragraph (b), clause (2), applies, the disability benefit must be paid for a period of 60
months from the disability benefit accrual date and, at the end of that period, is subject to provisions
of subdivision 5a.
    (d) For a member who is employed as a full-time firefighter by the Department of Military
Affairs of the state of Minnesota, allowable service as a full-time state Military Affairs Department
firefighter credited by the Minnesota State Retirement System may be used in meeting the minimum
allowable service requirement of this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, and applies to disability benefit
applicants whose last day of public employment was after June 30, 2007.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.656, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Total and permanent regular disability; computation of benefits. (a) A member
of the police and fire plan whose disabling condition is determined to be a regular disability under
section 353.01, subdivision 46 that is also a permanent and total disability as defined in section
353.01, subdivision 19, is entitled to a receive, for life, disability benefit in an amount equal to
45 percent of the average salary as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 17a, plus an additional
percent specified in section 356.315, subdivision 6, of that average salary for each year of service
in excess of 15 years.
    (b) A disability benefit payable under paragraph (a) is subject to eligibility review under
section 353.33, subdivision 6, but the review may be waived if the executive director receives a
written statement from the association's medical advisor that no improvement can be expected in
the member's disabling condition that was the basis for payment of the benefit under paragraph
(a). A member receiving a disability benefit under this subdivision who is found to no longer be
permanently and totally disabled as defined under section 353.01, subdivision 19, but continues to
meet the definition for receipt of a regular disability under section 353.01, subdivision 46, is subject
to subdivision 3 under this section upon written notice from the association's medical advisor that
the person is no longer considered permanently and totally disabled.
    (c) A member approved for disability benefits under this subdivision may elect to receive a
normal disability benefit or an actuarial equivalent optional annuity. If the election of an actuarial
equivalent optional annuity is not made at the time the total and permanent disability benefit
accrues, an election must be made within 90 days before the member attains normal retirement
age as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 37, paragraph (b), or having collected disability
benefits for 60 months, whichever is later. No surviving spouse benefits are payable if the member
dies during the period in which a normal total and permanent disability benefit is being paid. If a

when, during the period of disability, there has been no impairment of the person's salary as a police
officer, a firefighter, or a paramedic as defined in section 353.64, subdivision 10, whichever applies.
    (b) If a disabled member resumes a gainful occupation with earnings that, when added to the
normal disability benefit, and workers' compensation benefit if applicable, exceed the disabilitant
reemployment earnings limit, the amount of the disability benefit must be reduced as provided in
this paragraph. The disabilitant reemployment earnings limit is the greater of:
    (1) the salary earned at the date of disability; or

fund.
   (b) A disability benefit paid to a disabled member of the police and fire plan, that was granted
under laws in effect after June 30, 2007, terminates at the end of the month in which the member:
    (1) reaches normal retirement age;
   (2) if the disability benefit is payable for a 60-month period as determined under subdivisions 1
and 3, as applicable, the first of the month following the expiration of the 60-month period; or
   (3) if the disabled member so chooses, the end of the month in which the member has elected to
convert to an early retirement annuity under section 353.651, subdivision 4.
    (c) If the police and fire member continues to be disabled when the disability benefit terminates
under this subdivision, the member is deemed to be retired. The individual is entitled to receive
a normal retirement annuity or an early retirement annuity under section 353.651, whichever is
applicable, as further specified in paragraph (d) or (e). If the individual did not previously elect an
optional annuity under subdivision 1a, paragraph (a), the individual may elect an optional annuity
under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b).
    (d) A member of the police and fire plan who is receiving a disability benefit under this
section may, upon application, elect to receive an early retirement annuity under section 353.651,

retirement annuity elected under this subdivision must be calculated on the disabled member's
accrued years of service and average salary as defined in section 353.01, subdivision 17a, and
when elected, the member is deemed to be retired.
   (e) When an individual's benefit is recalculated as a retirement annuity under this section, the
annuity must be based on clause (1) or clause (2), whichever provides the greater amount:
   (1) the benefit amount at the time of reclassification, including all prior adjustments provided
under section 11A.18; or
   (2) a benefit amount computed on the member's actual years of accrued allowable service credit
and the law in effect at the time the disability benefit first accrued, plus any increases that would
have applied since that date under section 11A.18.

applicants whose last day of public employment was after June 30, 2007.

preceding the filing of an application,

continuation plan is paid for more than the 90-day period, from the date on which the payment of
salary ceased, whichever is later. Except for a total and permanent disability under subdivision 1a,
no member is entitled to receive a disability benefit payment when there remains to the member's
credit any unused annual leave, sick leave, or any other employer-paid salary continuation benefit,
or under any other circumstances when, during the period of disability, there has been no impairment
of the person's salary.
    (b) Payment of the disability benefit must not continue beyond the end of the month in which
entitlement has terminated. If the disabilitant dies prior to negotiating the check for the month in
which death occurs, payment must be made to the surviving spouse or, if none, to the designated
beneficiary or, if none, to the estate.

    Subd. 13. Chemical dependency limitations to disability benefit eligibility. (a) No benefits
are payable for any disability resulting in whole or in part from the member's current use of illegal
drugs. This exclusion does not apply to a member who:
   (1) has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program or has otherwise been
rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use; or
      (2) is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use.
    (b) "Illegal use of drugs" means the use of drugs, the possession or distribution of which is
unlawful under United States Code, title 21, section 801. "Illegal use of drugs" does not include
the use of a drug taken under the supervision of a licensed health care professional, or other uses
authorized by United States Code, title 21, or other provisions of law.

     Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 353.657, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:

    Subd. 2a. Death while eligible survivor benefit. (a) If a member or former member who has
attained the age of at least 50 years and has credit for not less than three years allowable service or
who has credit for at least 30 years of allowable service, regardless of age attained, dies before the
annuity or disability benefit becomes payable, notwithstanding any designation of beneficiary to the
contrary, the surviving spouse may elect to receive a death while eligible survivor benefit.
    (b) Notwithstanding the definition of surviving spouse in section 353.01, subdivision 20, a
former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the death while eligible survivor
benefit if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the association. If
there is no surviving spouse or child or children, a former spouse may be entitled to a lump-sum
refund payment under section 353.32, subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution
decree but not a death while eligible survivor benefit despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
      (c) The benefit may be elected instead of a refund with interest under section 353.32, subdivision
1, or surviving spouse benefits otherwise payable under subdivisions 1 and 2. The benefit must
be an annuity equal to the 100 percent joint and survivor annuity which the member could have
qualified for on the date of death, computed as provided in sections 353.651, subdivisions 2 and 3,
and 353.30, subdivision 3. ­                     I­f­­h

    (d) The board may continue to authorize the sale of life insurance to members under the
insurance program in effect on January 1, 1985, but must not change that program without the
approval of the commissioner of finance. The association shall not receive any financial benefit

members or nonmembers.
    (e) The board shall establish procedures governing reimbursement of expenses to board
members. These procedures shall define the types of activities and expenses that qualify for
reimbursement, shall provide that all out-of-state travel must be authorized by the board, and
shall provide for independent verification of claims for expense reimbursement. The procedures
must comply with applicable rules and policies of the Department of Finance, the Department of
Administration, and the Department of Employee Relations.

members of the board of trustees and employees of the association and may purchase property

   Sec. 2. [356.95] PENSION PLAN APPEAL PROCEDURES.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) Unless the language or context clearly indicates that a different
meaning is intended, for the purpose of this section, the terms in paragraphs (b) to (e) have the
meanings given them.
   (b) "Chief administrative officer" means the executive director of a covered pension plan or the
executive director's designee or representative.
    (c) "Covered pension plan" means a plan enumerated in section 356.20, subdivision 2, clauses
(1) to (4), (10), and (12) to (14), but does not mean the deferred compensation plan administered
under sections 352.96 and 352.97 or to the postretirement health care savings plan administered
under section 352.98.
   (d) "Governing board" means the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees Retirement
Association, the Board of Trustees of the Teachers Retirement Association, or the Board of
Directors of the Minnesota State Retirement System.
   (e) "Person" includes an active, retired, deferred, or nonvested inactive participant in a covered
pension plan or a beneficiary of a participant, or an individual who has applied to be a participant
or who is or may be a survivor of a participant, or a state agency or other governmental unit that
employs active participants in a covered pension plan.
    Subd. 2. Right to review. A determination made by the administration of a covered pension plan
regarding a person's eligibility, benefits, or other rights under the plan with which the person does
not agree is subject to review under this section.
    Subd. 3. Notice of determination. If the applicable chief administrative officer denies an
application or a written request, modifies a benefit, or terminates a benefit of a person claiming a
right or potential rights under a covered pension plan, the chief administrative officer shall notify
that person through a written notice containing:
   (1) a statement of the reasons for the determination;
    (2) a notice that the person may petition the governing board of the covered pension plan
for a review of the determination and that a person's petition for review must be filed in the
administrative office of the covered pension plan within 60 days of the receipt of the written notice
of the determination;
    (3) a statement indicating that a failure to petition for review within 60 days precludes the person
from contesting in any other administrative review or court procedure the issues determined by the
chief administrative officer;
    (4) a statement indicating that all relevant materials, documents, affidavits, and other records
that the person wishes to be reviewed in support of the petition must be filed with and received in
the administrative office of the covered pension plan at least 30 days before the date of the hearing
under subdivision 10; and

   (5) a copy of this section.
    Subd. 4. Termination of benefits. (a) If a covered pension plan decides to terminate a benefit
that is being paid to a person, before terminating the benefit, the chief administrative officer must,
in addition to the other procedures prescribed in this section, provide the individual with written
notice of the pending benefit termination by certified mail. The notice must explain the reason for
the pending benefit termination. The person must be given an opportunity to explain, in writing, in
person, by telephone, or by e-mail, the reasons that the benefit should not be terminated.
    (b) If the chief administrative officer is unable to contact the person and determines that a
failure to terminate the benefit will result in unauthorized payment by a covered pension plan, the
chief administrative officer may terminate the benefit immediately upon mailing a written notice
containing the information required by subdivision 3 to the address to which the most recent benefit
payment was sent and, if that address is that of a financial institution, to the last known address of
the person.
    Subd. 5. Petition for review. (a) A person who claims a right under subdivision 2 may petition
for a review of that decision by the governing board of the covered pension plan.
    (b) A petition under this section must be sent to the chief administrative officer by mail and must
be postmarked no later than 60 days after the person received the notice required by subdivision 3.
The petition must include the person's statement of the reason or reasons that the person believes
the decision of the chief administrative officer should be reversed or modified. The petition may
include all documentation and written materials that the petitioner deems to be relevant.
    Subd. 6. Failure to petition. If a timely petition for review under subdivision 5 is not filed with
the chief administrative officer, the covered pension plan's determination is final and is not subject
to further administrative or judicial review.
    Subd. 7. Notice of hearing. (a) After receiving a petition, and not less than 30 calendar days
from the date of the next regular board meeting, the chief administrative officer must schedule a
timely review of the petition before the governing board of the covered pension plan. The review
must be scheduled to take into consideration any necessary accommodations to allow the petitioner
to participate in the governing board's review.
    (b) Not less than 15 calendar days before the scheduled hearing date, the chief administrative
officer must provide by mail to the petitioner an acknowledgment of the receipt of the person's
petition and a follow-up notice of the time and place of the meeting at which the governing board
is scheduled to consider the petition and must provide a copy of all relevant documents, evidence,
summaries, and recommendations assembled by or on behalf of the plan administration to be
considered by the governing board.
    (c) Except as provided in subdivision 8, paragraph (c), all documents and materials that the
petitioner wishes to be part of the record for review must be filed with the chief administrative
officer and must be received in the offices of the covered pension plan at least 30 days before the
date of the meeting at which the petition is scheduled to be heard.
    (d) A petitioner, within ten calendar days of the scheduled date of the applicable board meeting,
may request a continuance on a scheduled petition. The chief administrative officer must reschedule
the review within 60 days of the date of the continuance request. Only one continuance may be

granted to any petitioner.
    Subd. 8. Record for review. (a) All evidence, including all records, documents, and affidavits
in the possession of the covered pension plan of which the covered pension plan desires to avail
itself and be considered by the governing board, and all evidence which the petitioner wishes to
present to the governing board, including any evidence which would otherwise be classified by law
as "private," must be made part of the hearing record.
  (b) Not later than seven days before the scheduled hearing date, the chief administrative officer
must provide a copy of the record to each member of the governing board.
    (c) At least five days before the hearing, the petitioner may submit to the chief administrative
officer, for submission to the governing board, any additional document, affidavit, or other relevant
information that was not initially submitted with the petition.
    Subd. 9. Amended determination. At any time before the hearing before the governing board,
for good cause shown and made part of the records of the plan, the chief administrative officer may
reverse, alter, amend, or modify the prior decision which is subject to review under this section
by issuing an amended decision. Upon doing so, the chief administrative officer may cancel the
governing board's scheduled review of the person's petition and shall so notify the petitioner.
    Subd. 10. Hearing. (a) The governing board shall hold a timely hearing on a petition for review
as part of a regularly scheduled board meeting, or as part of a special meeting if so scheduled.
All governing board members who participate in the decision-making process must be familiar
with the record. The governing board shall make its decision on a petition solely on the record
as submitted and on the proceedings of the hearing. At the hearing, the petitioner, the petitioner's
attorney, and the chief administrative officer may state and discuss with the governing board their
positions with respect to the petition. The governing board may allow further documentation to be
placed in the record at the board meeting only with the agreement of both the chief administrative
officer and the petitioner. The chief administrative officer may not otherwise participate in the
board's decision-making process.
    (b) When a petition presents a contested issue of law, an assistant attorney general may
participate and may argue on behalf of the legal position taken by the chief administrative officer if
that assistant attorney general does not also serve as the governing board's legal advisor during the
board's decision-making process.
    (c) A motion by a board member, supported by a summary of the relevant facts, conclusions and
reasons, as properly amended and approved by a majority of the governing board, constitutes the
board's final decision. A verbatim statement of the board's final decision must be served upon the
petitioner. If the decision is contrary to the petitioner's desired outcome, the notice shall inform the
petitioner of the appeal rights set forth in subdivision 13.
   (d) If a petitioner who received timely notice of a scheduled hearing fails to appear, the governing
board may nevertheless hear the petition and issue a decision.
    Subd. 11. Disability medical issues. (a) If a person petitions the governing board to reverse or
modify a determination which found that there exists no medical data supporting an application for
disability benefits, the board may reverse that determination only if there is in fact medical evidence
supporting the application. The board has the discretion to resubmit a disability benefit application at
4066                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [68TH DAY

any time to a medical advisor for reconsideration, and the resubmission may include an instruction
that further medical examinations be obtained.
    (b) The governing board may make a determination contrary to the recommendation of the
medical advisor only if there is expert medical evidence in the record to support its contrary decision.
If there is no medical evidence contrary to the opinion of the medical advisor in the record and
the medical advisor attests that the decision was made in accordance with the applicable disability
standard, the board must follow the decision of the medical advisor regarding the cause of the
disability.
   (c) The obligation of the governing board to follow the decision of the medical advisor under
paragraph (b) does not apply to instances when the governing board makes a determination different
from the recommendation of the medical advisor on issues that do not involve medical issues.
    Subd. 12. Referral for administrative hearing. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of
sections 14.03, 14.06, and 14.57 to 14.69 to the contrary, a challenge to a determination of the
chief administrative officer of a covered pension plan must be conducted exclusively under the
procedures set forth in this section and is not a contested case under chapter 14.
   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a governing board, in its sole discretion,
may refer a petition brought under this section to the Office of Administrative Hearings for a
contested case hearing under sections 14.57 to 14.69.
    Subd. 13. Appeal of the governing board's decision; judicial review. Within 60 days of the
date of the mailing of the notice of the governing board's decision, the petitioner may appeal the
decision by filing a writ of certiorari with the Court of Appeals under section 606.01 and Rule 115
of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure. Failure by a person to appeal to the Court
of Appeals within the 60-day period precludes the person from later raising, in any subsequent
administrative hearing or court proceeding, those substantive and procedural issues that reasonably
should have been raised upon a timely appeal.
    Subd. 14. Petitions without notice. Notwithstanding the petition notice and requirements under
this section, a person who believes that the person's rights have been affected by a decision made
by the administration of a covered pension plan may request a review under this section by the
appropriate governing board. The petition under this subdivision must be made within 45 days of
the time that the person knew or should have known of the disputed decision.
    Subd. 15. Governing board review panel. Any covered pension plan subject to this section,
by motion duly made and adopted, may appoint a panel of governing board members to hear and
determine any or all petitions brought under this section. The governing board review panel must
contain a minimum number of board members that would otherwise constitute a quorum of board
members under the governing body's rules and procedures.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 3. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, sections 352.031; and 354.071, are repealed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination
of annual cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability
insurance. For calculations of the cost-of-living adjustment under paragraph (b), the term "average
third quarter Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided
by 3.

   (b) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
cost-of-living adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the same
average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting quotient,
and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
one percent. The final amount may not be negative and may not exceed 5.0 percent.

    (c) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) is the full cost-of-living adjustment to be
applied as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member under subdivision
3 on January 1 of the next calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit
commencement occurred during the calendar year before the cost-of-living adjustment is applied,
the full increase amount must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit
payment status in the calendar year prior to the January 1 on which the cost-of-living adjustment
is applied, calculated to the third decimal place.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 356.215, subdivision 11, is amended to read:
    Subd. 11. Amortization contributions. (a) In addition to the exhibit indicating the level normal
cost, the actuarial valuation must contain an exhibit indicating the additional annual contribution
sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability. For funds governed by chapters 3A,
352, 352B, 352C, 353, 354, 354A, and 490, the additional contribution must be calculated on a
level percentage of covered payroll basis by the established date for full funding in effect when
the valuation is prepared. For funds governed by chapter 3A, sections 352.90 through 352.951,
chapters 352B, 352C, sections 353.63 through 353.68, and chapters 353C, 354A, and 490, the
level percent additional contribution must be calculated assuming annual payroll growth of 6.5
percent. For funds governed by sections 352.01 through 352.86 and chapter 354, the level percent
additional contribution must be calculated assuming an annual payroll growth of five percent. For
the fund governed by sections 353.01 through 353.46, the level percent additional contribution must
be calculated assuming an annual payroll growth of six percent. For all other funds, the additional
annual contribution must be calculated on a level annual dollar amount basis.

Employees Retirement Association general plan, and the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund
Association, if there has not been a change in the actuarial assumptions used for calculating the
actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits
payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial cost method used in calculating the actuarial
accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a combination of the three, which change or
changes by itself or by themselves without inclusion of any other items of increase or decrease
produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund, the established date
for full funding is the first actuarial valuation date occurring after June 1, 2020.

Employees Retirement Association general plan, if there has been a change in any or all of the
actuarial assumptions used for calculating the actuarial accrued liability of the fund, a change in
the benefit plan governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund, a change in the actuarial
cost method used in calculating the actuarial accrued liability of all or a portion of the fund, or a
combination of the three, and the change or changes, by itself or by themselves and without inclusion
of any other items of increase or decrease, produce a net increase in the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability in the fund, the established date for full funding must be determined using the following
procedure:
   (i) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with the
plan provisions governing annuities and retirement benefits and the actuarial assumptions in effect
before an applicable change;
   (ii) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed

to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined under item (i) by the
established date for full funding in effect before the change must be calculated using the interest
assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;
    (iii) the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the fund must be determined in accordance with
any new plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable from the fund and any new
actuarial assumptions and the remaining plan provisions governing annuities and benefits payable
from the fund and actuarial assumptions in effect before the change;
    (iv) the level annual dollar contribution or level percentage, whichever is applicable, needed to
amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
   (d) For the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the established date for full funding is
June 30, 2020.
    (e) For the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association,
the established date for full funding is June 30, 2031.
   (f) For the Teachers Retirement Association, the established date for full funding is June 30,
2037.
    (g) For the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, the established date for full funding
is June 30, 2038. In addition to other requirements of this chapter, the annual actuarial valuation
shall contain an exhibit indicating the funded ratio and the deficiency or sufficiency in annual
contributions when comparing liabilities to the market value of the assets of the fund as of the
close of the most recent fiscal year.
   (h) For the retirement plans for which the annual actuarial valuation indicates an excess of
valuation assets over the actuarial accrued liability, the valuation assets in excess of the actuarial
accrued liability must be recognized as a reduction in the current contribution requirements by an

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 422A.01, subdivision 13a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 13a. Covered salary. (a) "Salary" is subject to the limitations of section 356.611.
    (b) "Salary" also includes the contributions to a supplemental retirement plan under section
356.24, subdivision 1, clause (8), (9), or (10), for an employee who is covered by a supplemental
retirement plan which requires that all plan contributions be made by the person's employer from
mandatory withholdings from the employee's wages.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 422A.05, subdivision 2c, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2c. Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund investment authority. (a) For
investments made on or after July 1, 1991, the board shall invest funds only in investments
authorized by section 356A.06, subdivision 7.
    (b) However, in addition to real estate investments authorized under paragraph (a), the board
may also make loans to purchasers of Minnesota situs nonfarm residential real estate that is owned
by the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund. The loans must be secured by mortgages or deeds
of trust.
   (c) For investments made before July 1, 1991, the board may, but is not required to, comply with
paragraph (a). However, with respect to these investments, the board shall act in accordance with
subdivision 2a and chapter 356A.
    (d) The board may certify assets for investment by the State Board of Investment under section
11A.17. Alternatively or in addition, the board may certify assets for investment by the State Board
of Investment in fixed income pools or in a separately managed account at the discretion of the State
Board of Investment as provided in section 11A.14.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 422A.06, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Deposit accumulation fund. (a) The deposit accumulation fund consists of the assets
held in the fund, including amounts contributed by or for employees, amounts contributed by the
city, amounts contributed by municipal activities supported in whole or in part by revenues other
than taxes and amounts contributed by any public corporation, amounts paid by the state, and by
income from investments.
   (b) There must be paid from the fund the amounts required to be transferred to the retirement
benefit fund, or the disability benefit fund, refunds of contributions, including the death-while-active

refund specified in section 422A.22, subdivision 4, postretirement increases in retirement
allowances granted under Laws 1965, chapter 688, or Laws 1969, chapter 859, and expenses of
the administration of the retirement fund which were not charged by the retirement board against
the income of the retirement benefit fund from investments as the cost of handling the investments
of the retirement benefit fund.
    (c) To the extent that the deposit accumulation fund has insufficient assets to transfer the total
value of the required reserves for retirement annuities to either the disability benefit fund under
subdivisions 5 and 7 or the retirement benefit fund under subdivisions 5 and 8 as required, the
deposit accumulation fund has a transfer amount payable on which an interest charge accrues. The
executive director must determine the interest charge for the period that the transfer amount payable
remains unpaid at an annual rate equal to five percent plus the percentage increase in the amount
of the annual Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as calculated by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor from the previous June 30.
The interest charge must be reflected in the books of the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund
and assessed against the deposit accumulation fund based on the average quarterly transfer amount
payable balance outstanding. Any revenue received by the deposit accumulation fund subsequent
to unpaid transfers must be transferred from the deposit accumulation fund to the disability benefit
fund or to the retirement fund, whichever applies, and must first be applied to any remaining interest
charge and then must be applied to the principal amount of transfer amount payable outstanding.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 422A.06, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Transfer of reserves to retirement benefit fund; adjustments of annuities and

beginning on January 1, 2006, if the person is the surviving spouse of a deceased service pensioner,
deferred pensioner, or superannuation pensioner. The surviving spouse benefit is payable for the life
of the surviving spouse.
     (b) A surviving child of a deceased service pensioner, disability pensioner, deferred pensioner,
superannuation pensioner, or active member, who was living while the decedent was an active
member of the police department or was born within nine months after the decedent terminated
active service in the police department, is entitled to a surviving child benefit. The surviving child
benefit is equal to eight units per month if the person is the surviving child of a deceased active
member or disabilitant. The surviving child benefit is equal to two units per month, plus an additional
four-tenths of one unit per month for each year of service to the credit of the decedent in excess of
five years, to a maximum of eight units, if the person is the surviving child of a deceased service
pensioner, deferred pensioner, or superannuation pensioner. The surviving child benefit is payable
until the person attains age 18, or, if in full-time attendance during the normal school year, in a school
approved by the board of directors, until the person receives a bachelor's degree or attains the age of
22 years, whichever occurs first. In the event of the death of both parents leaving a surviving child
or children entitled to a surviving child benefit as determined in this paragraph, the surviving child
is, or the surviving children are, entitled to a surviving child benefit in such sums as determined by
the board of directors to be necessary for the care and education of such surviving child or children,
but not to exceed the family maximum benefit per month, to the children of any one family.
   (c) The surviving spouse and surviving child benefits are subject to a family maximum benefit.
The family maximum benefit is 41 units per month.
    (d) A surviving spouse who is otherwise not qualified may receive a benefit if the surviving
spouse was married to the decedent for a period of five years and was residing with the decedent
at the time of death. The surviving spouse benefit is the same as that provided in paragraph (a),
except that if the surviving spouse is younger than the decedent, the surviving spouse benefit must
be actuarially equivalent to a surviving spouse benefit that would have been paid to the member's
spouse had the member been married to a person of the same age or a greater age than the member's
age before retirement.
    (e) For any surviving spouse who began receiving survivor benefits before January 1, 2005, the

section are hereby ratified and confirmed.
     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 423C.06, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Actuarial assets of special fund less than 102 percent. (a) When the actuarial assets of
the special fund in any year are less than 102 percent of its accrued liabilities according to the most
recent annual actuarial valuation of the special fund prepared in accordance with sections 356.215
and 356.216, investment-related postretirement adjustments shall be determined and paid pursuant
to this subdivision. Payment of the annual postretirement adjustment may be made only if there is
excess investment income.
    (b) The board shall determine by May 1 of each year whether or not the special fund has excess
investment income. The amount of excess investment income, if any, must be stated as a dollar
amount and reported by the executive secretary to the mayor and governing body of the city, the
state auditor, the commissioner of finance, and the executive director of the Legislative Commission
on Pensions and Retirement. The dollar amount of excess investment income up to one percent of
the assets of the special fund must be applied for the purpose specified in paragraph (c). Excess
investment income must not be considered as income to or assets of the special fund for actuarial
valuations of the special fund for that year under this section and sections 69.77, 356.215, and
356.216, except to offset the annual postretirement adjustment. Additional investment income is
any realized or unrealized investment income other than the excess investment income and must be
included in the actuarial valuations performed under this section and sections 69.77, 356.215, and
356.216.

of units to which eligible members are entitled into the excess investment income available for
distribution to eligible members, and then multiplying that result by the number of units to which
each eligible member is entitled. If this amount exceeds the total monthly benefit that the eligible
member was entitled to in the prior year under the terms of this chapter, the association shall pay
the eligible member the lesser amount. Payment of the annual postretirement adjustment must be in
a lump-sum amount on June 1 following the determination date in any year. In the event an eligible
member dies prior to the payment of the annual postretirement adjustment, the executive secretary
shall pay the eligible member's estate the amount to which the member was entitled.
   EFFECTIVE DATE; LOCAL APPROVAL. This section is effective the day after the city
council of the city of Minneapolis and its chief clerical officer timely complete their compliance
with section 645.021, subdivisions 2 and 3.

                     VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER BENEFIT CHANGES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 424A.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) "qualified recipient" means an individual who receives a lump sum distribution of pension or
retirement benefits from a firefighters' relief association for service that the individual has performed
as a volunteer firefighter;
    (2) "survivor of a deceased active or deferred volunteer firefighter" means the legally married
spouse of a deceased volunteer firefighter, or, if none, the surviving minor child or minor children
of a deceased volunteer firefighter;
    (3) "active volunteer firefighter" means a person who regularly renders fire suppression service
for a municipal fire department or an independent nonprofit firefighting corporation, who has met
the statutory and other requirements for relief association membership, and who has been a fully
qualified member of the relief association for at least one month; and
    (4) "deferred volunteer firefighter" means a former active volunteer firefighter who terminated
active firefighting service, has sufficient service credit from the applicable relief association to be
entitled to a service pension, but has not applied for or has not received the service pension.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for supplemental benefits paid after July 1, 2007.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 424A.10, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Payment of supplemental benefit. (a) Upon the payment by a firefighters' relief
association of a lump sum distribution to a qualified recipient, the association must pay a
supplemental benefit to the qualified recipient. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the relief
association m ­­­ must pay the supplemental benefit out of its special fund. The amount of this
               ay
benefit equals ten percent of the regular lump sum distribution that is paid on the basis of the
recipient's service as a volunteer firefighter. In no case may the amount of the supplemental benefit
exceed $1,000. A supplemental benefit under this paragraph may not be paid to a survivor of a
deceased active or deferred volunteer firefighter in that capacity.
    (b) Upon the payment by a relief association of a lump sum survivor benefit or funeral benefit to
a survivor of a deceased active volunteer firefighter or of a deceased deferred volunteer firefighter,
the association may pay a supplemental survivor benefit to the survivor of the deceased active
or deferred volunteer firefighter from the special fund of the relief association if its articles of
incorporation or bylaws so provide. The amount of the supplemental survivor benefit is 20 percent
of the survivor benefit or funeral benefit, but not to exceed $2,000.
    (c) An individual may receive a supplemental benefit under paragraph (a) or under paragraph

    Subd. 3. Designation of positions; employer discretion. (a) Before offering an incentive
under this section, an appointing authority must be experiencing employee layoffs due to budget
shortfalls or a reorganization that would be offset by offering the incentive. The appointing
authority must document that the incentive payment is equal to or less than the cost of the employee
layoff. The appointing authority must designate the job classifications or positions within the job
classifications that qualify for the incentive. The appointing authority may modify this designation
at any time. Designation of positions eligible for the incentive under this section, participation of
individual employees, and the amount of the payment under this section are at the sole discretion
of the appointing authority. Unilateral implementation of this section by the employer is not an
unfair labor practice under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 179A.
    (b) An employee who is eligible for an incentive under this section, who is offered an incentive
by the appointing authority, and who accepts the incentive offer must do so in writing. A copy of
the acceptance document must be provided by the appointing authority to the applicable retirement
plan within 15 days of its execution.
    Subd. 4. Reemployment prohibition. No appointing authority referenced in subdivision 1
is permitted to employ or retain as a consultant an individual who received an early retirement
incentive under this section for a period of three years after the receipt of the incentive. This

provision does not prohibit a school district from employing as a substitute teacher an individual
who received an early retirement incentive under this section.
    Subd. 5. Utilization report. On August 1, 2008, and annually thereafter, the commissioner of
employee relations, with respect to the executive branch of state government, the commissioner
of education, with respect to school districts, and the chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities System, with respect to the system, shall report to the chair of the house of
representatives Finance Committee, the chair of the house of representatives Governmental
Operations, Reform, Technology and Elections Committee, the chair of the senate Finance
Committee, the chair of the senate State and Local Government Operations and Oversight
Committee, and the executive director of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement

employees who utilized the incentive, the age of each retiring employee, the length of service of
each retiring employee, the incentive amount paid to each retiring employee, the amount of salary
savings through the previous June 30 obtained for each retiring employee, and the amount of any
other financial or budgetary impact related to each retiring employee.

    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 168.013, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
   Subd. 1a. Passenger automobile; hearse. (a) On passenger automobiles as defined in section
168.011, subdivision 7, and hearses, except as otherwise provided, the tax shall be $10 plus an
additional tax equal to 1.25 percent of the base value.
   (b) Subject to the classification provisions herein, "base value" means the manufacturer's
suggested retail price of the vehicle including destination charge using list price information
published by the manufacturer or determined by the registrar if no suggested retail price exists, and
shall not include the cost of each accessory or item of optional equipment separately added to the
vehicle and the suggested retail price.
     (c) If the manufacturer's list price information contains a single vehicle identification number
followed by various descriptions and suggested retail prices, the registrar shall select from those
listings only the lowest price for determining base value.
   (d) If unable to determine the base value because the vehicle is specially constructed, or for any
other reason, the registrar may establish such value upon the cost price to the purchaser or owner as
evidenced by a certificate of cost but not including Minnesota sales or use tax or any local sales or
other local tax.
    (e) The registrar shall classify every vehicle in its proper base value class as follows:
                                         FROM                                           TO
                                         $     0                                    $    199.99
                                             200                                         399.99

and thereafter a series of classes successively set in brackets having a spread of $200 consisting of
such number of classes as will permit classification of all vehicles.
    (f) The base value for purposes of this section shall be the middle point between the extremes
of its class.
    (g) The registrar shall establish the base value, when new, of every passenger automobile and
hearse registered prior to the effective date of Extra Session Laws 1971, chapter 31, using list
price information published by the manufacturer or any nationally recognized firm or association
compiling such data for the automotive industry. If unable to ascertain the base value of any
registered vehicle in the foregoing manner, the registrar may use any other available source or
method. The registrar shall calculate tax using base value information available to dealers and
deputy registrars at the time the application for registration is submitted. The tax on all previously
registered vehicles shall be computed upon the base value thus determined taking into account the
depreciation provisions of paragraph (h).
    (h) The annual additional tax computed upon the base value as provided herein, during the first

      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 168.017, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
  Subd. 3. Exceptions. (a) The registrar shall register all vehicles subject to registration under the
monthly series system for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months, unless:
      (1) the application is an original rather than renewal application; or
    (2) the applicant is a licensed motor vehicle lessor under section 168.27 and the vehicle is leased
or rented for periods of time of not more than 28 days, in which case the applicant may apply
for initial or renewed registration of a vehicle for a period of four or more months, the month of
expiration to be designated by the applicant at the time of registration. However, to qualify for this
exemption, the applicant must (1) present the application to the registrar at St. Paul, or ­  a­a

month of expiration as if the vehicle is being registered for a period of 12 calendar months.
    (b) In any instance except that of a licensed motor vehicle lessor, the registrar shall not approve
registering the vehicle subject to the application for a period of less than three months, except when
the registrar determines that to do otherwise will help to equalize the registration and renewal work
load of the department.
      Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 174.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

recipients outside of the metropolitan area.
      Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 174.24, subdivision 3b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3b. Operating assistance; recipient classifications. (a) The commissioner shall
determine the total operating cost of any public transit system receiving or applying for assistance
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. To be eligible for financial assistance,
68TH DAY]                                                 MONDAY, MAY 14, 2007                                                                           4117

an applicant or recipient shall provide to the commissioner all financial records and other
information and shall permit any inspection reasonably necessary to determine total operating cost
and correspondingly the amount of assistance that may be paid to the applicant or recipient. Where
more than one county or municipality contributes assistance to the operation of a public transit
system, the commissioner shall identify one as lead agency for the purpose of receiving money
under this section.
     (b) Prior to distributing operating assistance to eligible recipients for any contract period,
the commissioner shall place all recipients into one of the following classifications: urbanized
area service, small urban area service, rural area service, and elderly and disabled service. The
commissioner shall distribute funds under this section so that the percentage of total operating
cost paid by any recipient from local sources will not exceed the percentage for that recipient's
classification, except as provided in an undue hardship case. The percentages must be: for urbanized
area service and small urban area service, 20 percent; for rural area service, 15 percent; and for
elderly and disabled service, 15 percent. The remainder of the total operating cost will be paid
from state funds less any assistance received by the recipient from any federal source. For purposes
of this subdivision, "local sources" means all local sources of funds and includes all operating
revenue, tax levies, and contributions from public funds, except that the commissioner may exclude
from the total assistance contract revenues derived from operations the cost of which is excluded
from the computation of total operating cost. Total operating costs of the Duluth Transit Authority
or a successor agency does not include costs related to the Superior, Wisconsin service contract
and the Independent School District No. 709 service contract. F                                       ­­ o­

    (c) If a recipient informs the commissioner in writing after the establishment of these percentages
but prior to the distribution of financial assistance for any year that paying its designated percentage
of total operating cost from local sources will cause undue hardship, the commissioner may reduce
the percentage to be paid from local sources by the recipient and increase the percentage to be paid
from local sources by one or more other recipients inside or outside the classification. However, the
commissioner may not reduce or increase any recipient's percentage under this paragraph for more
than two years successively. If for any year the funds appropriated to the commissioner to carry out
the purposes of this section are insufficient to allow the commissioner to pay the state share of total
operating cost as provided in this paragraph, the commissioner shall reduce the state share in each
classification to the extent necessary.

the commissioner shall certify to the commissioner of finance the amount of the aid, and the
commissioner of finance shall then issue a warrant in that amount payable to the county treasurer of
the county. Money so paid must be expended on the county state-aid highway system in accordance
with the rules of the commissioner.

so deducted shall be set aside in a separate account and shall be used for (1) the establishment,
location, relocation, construction, reconstruction, and improvement of those roads included in the
county state-aid highway system under Minnesota Statutes 1961, section 162.02, subdivision 6,
which border and provide substantial access to an outdoor recreation unit as defined in section
86A.04 or which provide access to the headquarters of or the principal parking lot located within
such a unit, and (2) the reconstruction, improvement, repair, and maintenance of county roads, city
streets, and town roads that provide access to public lakes, rivers, state parks, and state campgrounds.
Roads described in clause (2) are not required to meet county state-aid highway standards. At the
request of the commissioner of natural resources the counties wherein such roads are located shall
do such work as requested in the same manner as on any county state-aid highway and shall be
reimbursed for such construction, reconstruction, or improvements from the amount set aside by
this subdivision. Before requesting a county to do work on a county state-aid highway as provided
in this subdivision, the commissioner of natural resources must obtain approval for the project from
the County State-Aid Screening Board. The screening board, before giving its approval, must obtain
a written comment on the project from the county engineer of the county requested to undertake the
project. Before requesting a county to do work on a county road, city street, or a town road that
provides access to a public lake, a river, a state park, or a state campground, the commissioner of
natural resources shall obtain a written comment on the project from the county engineer of the
county requested to undertake the project. Any sums paid to counties or cities in accordance with
this subdivision shall reduce the money needs of said counties or cities in the amounts necessary
to equalize their status with those counties or cities not receiving such payments. Any balance of
the amount so set aside, at the end of each year shall be transferred to the county state-aid highway
fund.
   Subd. 6. County state-aid highway revolving loan account. A county state-aid highway
revolving loan account is created in the transportation revolving loan fund. The commissioner
may transfer to the account the amount allocated under section 162.065. Money in the account

may be used to make loans. Funds in the county state-aid highway revolving loan account may be
used only for aid in the construction, improvement, and maintenance of county state-aid highways.
Funds in the account may not be used for any toll facilities project or congestion-pricing project.
Repayments and interest from loans from the county state-aid highway revolving loan account must
be credited to that account. Money in the account is annually appropriated to the commissioner and
does not lapse. Interest earned from investment of money in this account must be deposited in the
county state-aid highway revolving loan account.

the several counties so that each county shall receive of such amount the percentage that its total
lane-miles of approved county state-aid highways bears to the total lane-miles of approved statewide
county state-aid highways. In 1997 and subsequent years no county may receive, as a result of an
apportionment under this clause based on lane-miles rather than miles of approved county state-aid
highways, an apportionment that is less than its apportionment in 1996.

    (d ) (e) An amount equal to 50 percent of the apportionment sum shall be apportioned among the
several counties so that each county shall receive of such amount the percentage that its money needs
bears to the sum of the money needs of all of the individual counties; provided, that the percentage
of such amount that each county is to receive shall be adjusted so that each county shall receive in
1958 a total apportionment at least ten percent greater than its total 1956 apportionments from the
state road and bridge fund; and provided further that those counties whose money needs are thus
adjusted shall never receive a percentage of the apportionment sum less than the percentage that
such county received in 1958.
      Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 162.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 1a. Apportionment sum and excess sum. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "amount
available" means the amount identified in section 162.06, subdivision 1.
      (b) The apportionment sum is calculated by subtracting the excess sum, as calculated in

paragraph (c), from the amount available.
     (c) The excess sum is calculated as the sum of revenue within the amount available:
    (1) attributed to that portion of the gasoline excise tax rate in excess of 20 cents per gallon, and to
that portion of the excise tax rate for E85, M85, and special fuels in excess of the energy equivalent
of a gasoline tax rate of 20 cents per gallon;
    (2) attributed to a change in the passenger vehicle registration tax under section 168.013,
imposed on or after July 1, 2007, that exceeds the amount collected in fiscal year 2007 multiplied
by the annual average United States Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, United States
city average, as determined by the United States Department of Labor for the previous year, divided
by the annual average for calendar year 2006; and
    (3) attributed to that portion of the motor vehicle sales tax revenue in excess of the percentage
allocated in fiscal year 2007.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 162.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1c. Excess sum. The commissioner shall apportion the excess sum to the several counties
on the basis of the needs of the counties, as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b).
   (a) An amount equal to 40 percent must be apportioned among the several counties so that each
county receives of that amount the percentage that its motor vehicle registration for the calendar
year preceding the one last past, determined by residence of registrants, bears to the total statewide
motor vehicle registration.
   (b) An amount equal to 60 percent must be apportioned among the several counties so that each
county receives of that amount the percentage that its money needs bears to the sum of the money
needs of all of the individual counties.
     Sec. 5. INSTRUCTION TO REVISOR.
    The revisor of statutes shall renumber Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 162.07, subdivision 1,

revenue fund as specified in section 299A.705.
    (2) Sixty-seven percent must be credited to the general fund.

    (3) Eight percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension account. Money in this account may be appropriated to the commissioner of public
safety and the appropriated amount must be apportioned 80 percent for laboratory costs and 20
percent for carrying out the provisions of section 299C.065.
   (4) Five percent must be credited to a separate account to be known as the vehicle forfeiture
account, which is created in the special revenue fund. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner for costs of handling vehicle forfeitures.

                                    ch­ the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be
known as the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury account. The revenue from $50 of the
surcharge on a reinstatement under paragraph (f) is credited from the first installment payment to
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury account. The money in the account is annually
appropriated to the commissioner of health to be used as follows: 83 percent for contracts with a
qualified community-based organization to provide information, resources, and support to assist
persons with traumatic brain injury and their families to access services, and 17 percent to maintain
the traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury registry created in section 144.662. For the
purposes of this paragraph, a "qualified community-based organization" is a private, not-for-profit
organization of consumers of traumatic brain injury services and their family members. The
organization must be registered with the United States Internal Revenue Service under section
501(c)(3) as a tax-exempt organization and must have as its purposes:
   (1) the promotion of public, family, survivor, and professional awareness of the incidence and
consequences of traumatic brain injury;
   (2) the provision of a network of support for persons with traumatic brain injury, their families,
and friends;
   (3) the development and support of programs and services to prevent traumatic brain injury;
   (4) the establishment of education programs for persons with traumatic brain injury; and
   (5) the empowerment of persons with traumatic brain injury through participation in its
governance.
A patient's name, identifying information, or identifiable medical data must not be disclosed to the
organization without the informed voluntary written consent of the patient or patient's guardian or,
if the patient is a minor, of the parent or guardian of the patient.
    (d) The remainder of the surcharge must be credited to a separate account to be known as the
remote electronic alcohol-monitoring program account. The commissioner shall transfer the balance
of this account to the commissioner of finance on a monthly basis for deposit in the general fund.
    (e) When these fees are collected by a licensing agent, appointed under section 171.061, a
handling charge is imposed in the amount specified under section 171.061, subdivision 4. The
reinstatement fees and surcharge must be deposited in an approved depository as directed under
section 171.061, subdivision 4.
   (f) A person whose driver's license has been revoked as provided in subdivision 1 under section
169A.52 or 169A.54 and who the court certifies as being financially eligible for a public defender
under section 611.17, may choose to pay 50 percent and an additional $25 of the total amount of the

surcharge and 50 percent of the fee required under paragraph (b) to reinstate the person's driver's
license, provided the person meets all other requirements of reinstatement. If a person chooses to
pay 50 percent of the total and an additional $25, the driver's license must expire after two years. The
person must pay an additional 50 percent less $25 of the total to extend the license for an additional
two years, provided the person is otherwise still eligible for the license. After this final payment
of the surcharge and fee, the license may be renewed on a standard schedule, as provided under
section 171.27. A handling charge may be imposed for each installment payment. Revenue from
the handling charge is credited to the driver services operating account in the special revenue fund
and is appropriated to the commissioner.
    (g) Any person making installment payments under paragraph (f), whose driver's license
subsequently expires, or is canceled, revoked, or suspended before payment of 100 percent of the
surcharge and fee, must pay the outstanding balance due for the initial reinstatement before the
driver's license is subsequently reinstated. Upon payment of the outstanding balance due for the
initial reinstatement, the person may pay any new surcharge and fee imposed under paragraph (b)
in installment payments as provided under paragraph (f).
