                                                                                     April 30, 2007
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 27, Senate File 1017.
2654                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [59TH DAY

Under current law, charter commissions for non-first class cities may spend up to $1,500.00 per
year in annual expenses without city council approval. Charter Commissions may spend more if
authorized by city councils. This bill would increase the annual amount of expenses allowed without
city council approval to $5,000.00 per year.
I strongly believe that city government and taxpayer revenues should be under the control of the
elected city council, not charter commissions. City council members are the individuals whom the
voters have entrusted to make decisions for the spending of city funds and are in the best position to
weigh the spending priorities of the city. More than tripling the annual expense accounts for these
non-elected charter commissions and bypassing the city council in the process is not necessary for
the efficient operation of local government and makes city government less accountable.
I am mindful that many things have changed since the current law was first put into place in 1961.
Again, however, if these commissions have legitimate expense needs, current law allows the city
council to approve expenditures beyond the current limit. The Legislature need not usurp city
councils in this regard.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 1017 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

    Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 18B.26, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Application fee. (a) A registrant shall pay an annual application fee for each pesticide
to be registered, and this fee is set at 0.4 percent of annual gross sales within the state and annual
gross sales of pesticides used in the state, with a minimum nonrefundable fee of $250. The registrant
shall determine when and which pesticides are sold or used in this state. The registrant shall secure
sufficient sales information of pesticides distributed into this state from distributors and dealers,
regardless of distributor location, to make a determination. Sales of pesticides in this state and sales
of pesticides for use in this state by out-of-state distributors are not exempt and must be included in
the registrant's annual report, as required under paragraph (c), and fees shall be paid by the registrant
based upon those reported sales. Sales of pesticides in the state for use outside of the state are exempt
from the application fee in this paragraph if the registrant properly documents the sale location and
distributors. A registrant paying more than the minimum fee shall pay the balance due by March 1
based on the gross sales of the pesticide by the registrant for the preceding calendar year. The fee
for disinfectants and sanitizers shall be the minimum. The minimum fee is due by December 31
preceding the year for which the application for registration is made. The commissioner shall spend
at least ­

    (b) An additional fee of $100 must be paid by the applicant for each pesticide to be registered if
the application is a renewal application that is submitted after December 31.
    (c) A registrant must annually report to the commissioner the amount and type of each registered
pesticide sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed in the state. The report shall be filed by
March 1 for the previous year's registration. The commissioner shall specify the form of the report
and require additional information deemed necessary to determine the amount and type of pesticides
annually distributed in the state. The information required shall include the brand name, amount,
and formulation of each pesticide sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed in the state, but
the information collected, if made public, shall be reported in a manner which does not identify a
specific brand name in the report.
    (d) A registrant who is required to pay more than the minimum fee for any pesticide under
paragraph (a) must pay a late fee penalty of $100 for each pesticide application fee paid after March
1 in the year for which the license is to be issued.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2008, and applies to all cooperative
agreements entered into by the commissioner of agriculture and local units of government for

    Subd. 4. Fee. (a) The response and reimbursement fee consists of the surcharges and
any adjustments made by the commissioner in this subdivision and shall be collected by the
commissioner. The amount of the response and reimbursement fee shall be determined and
imposed annually by the commissioner as required to satisfy the requirements in subdivision 3. The
commissioner shall adjust the amount of the surcharges imposed in proportion to the amount of
the surcharges listed in this subdivision. License application categories under paragraph (d) must
be charged in proportion to the amount of surcharges imposed up to a maximum of 50 percent of
the license fees set under chapters 18B and 18C.

   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 32.21, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Penalties. (a) A person, other than a milk producer, who violates this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor or subject to a civil penalty up to $1,000.
    (b) A milk producer may not change milk plants within 30 days, without permission of the

    (c) A milk producer who violates subdivision 3, clause (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), is subject to
clauses (1) to (3) of this paragraph.
   (1) Upon notification of the first violation in a 12-month period, the producer must meet with
2686                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [59TH DAY

    (2) Upon the second violation within a 12-month period, the producer is subject to a civil penalty
of $300. The commissioner shall notify the producer by certified mail stating the penalty is payable
in 30 days, the consequences of failure to pay the penalty, and the consequences of future violations.
    (3) Upon the third violation within a 12-month period, the producer is subject to an additional
civil penalty of $300 and possible revocation of the producer's permit or certification. The
commissioner shall notify the producer by certified mail that all civil penalties owed must be paid
within 30 days and that the commissioner is initiating administrative procedures to revoke the
producer's permit or certification to sell milk for at least 30 days.
    (d) The producer's shipment of milk must be immediately suspended if the producer is identified
as an individual source of milk containing residues causing a bulk load of milk to test positive in
violation of subdivision 3, clause (6) or (7). The Grade A or manufacturing grade permit must
be converted to temporary status for not more than 30 days and shipment may resume only after
subsequent milk has been sampled by the commissioner or the commissioner's agent and found to
contain no residues above established tolerances or safe levels.
    The Grade A or manufacturing grade permit may be restored if the producer completes the
"Milk and Dairy Beef Residue Prevention Protocol" with a licensed veterinarian, displays the signed
certificate in the milkhouse, and sends verification to the commissioner within the 30-day temporary
permit status period. If the producer does not comply within the temporary permit status period, the
Grade A or manufacturing grade permit must be suspended. A milk producer whose milk supply is
in violation of subdivision 3, clause (6) or (7), and has caused a bulk load to test positive is subject
to clauses (1) to (3) of this paragraph.
    (1) For the first violation in a 12-month period, the penalty is the value of all milk on the
contaminated load plus any costs associated with the disposition of the contaminated load. Future
pickups are prohibited until subsequent testing reveals the milk is free of drug residue. A farm
inspection must be completed by a qualified dairy sanitarian and the producer to determine the
cause of the residue and actions required to prevent future violations.
    (2) For the second violation in a 12-month period, the penalty is the value of all milk on the
contaminated load plus any costs associated with the disposition of the contaminated load. Future
pickups are prohibited until subsequent testing reveals the milk is free of drug residue. A farm

certification to sell milk for a minimum of 30 days.
    (4) If a bulk load of milk tests negative for residues and there is a positive producer sample
on the load, no civil penalties may be assessed to the producer. The plant must report the positive
result within 24 hours and reject further milk shipments from that producer until the producer's milk
tests negative. A farm inspection must be completed by ­h  t­­

veterans, the names of qualified applicants who are not veterans shall be added to the list. The board
shall then select the most qualified applicant from the list. At any point in the executive director
selection process, if the board concludes that no applicant is sufficiently qualified for the position,
the board may reopen the application process.

of representatives with jurisdiction over the policy or finance of veterans affairs and military affairs
regarding the psychological status and needs of soldiers and veterans returning to Minnesota
after having served in support of contingency operations for Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom.
    The report must provide the best relevant insights into and advice concerning how to most
effectively provide the psychological support services determined to be needed by those soldiers
and veterans. The report shall also provide an overview and discussion of the types of federal,
state, and local mental health resources available to soldiers and veterans throughout the state, with
particular emphasis on the role and capabilities of the mental health facility under planning by the
Minnesota Veterans Homes Board in Kandiyohi County.
