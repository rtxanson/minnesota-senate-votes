   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.021, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Required academic standards. (a) The following subject areas are required for
statewide accountability:
   (1) language arts;
   (2) mathematics;
   (3) science;
   (4) social studies, including history, geography, economics, and government and citizenship;
   (5) health and physical education, for which locally developed academic standards apply; ­
                                                                                            an

    (6) world languages for which a statewide intermediate-low standard of proficiency applies as
determined by a statewide proficiency assessment; and
    (7) the arts, for which statewide or locally developed academic standards apply, as determined
by the school district. Public elementary and middle schools must offer at least three and require at
least two of the following four arts areas: dance; music; theater; and visual arts. Public high schools
must offer at least three and require at least one of the following five arts areas: media arts; dance;
music; theater; and visual arts.
    (b) The commissioner must submit proposed standards in science and social studies to the
legislature by February 1, 2004.
For purposes of applicable federal law, the academic standards for language arts, mathematics, and
science apply to all public school students, except the very few students with extreme cognitive
or physical impairments for whom an individualized education plan team has determined that the
required academic standards are inappropriate. An individualized education plan team that makes
this determination must establish alternative standards.
    (c) A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation
requirements that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A
school district that incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school
year must provide students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the
opportunity to earn a diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in
effect when the students entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve
instruction or curriculum as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with

sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and 120B.20.
    (d) A school district, no later than the 2010-2011 school year, must adopt graduation
requirements for world languages that require a student to reach an intermediate-low level
of proficiency on the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages performance
guidelines for kindergarten through grade 12 learners. The standards apply to students who enter
5th grade in or after the 2010-2011 school year. To comply with the world languages requirement,
a school district must offer students world languages instruction. The district may designate the
grade levels for the instruction, which requires a district-selected high-quality, sustainable language
acquisition program. To determine whether students have achieved an intermediate-low standard
of proficiency, the commissioner must administer statewide an existing, nationally recognized,
valid and reliable proficiency assessment that appropriately accommodates the age differences
in the students taking the assessments. Students with limited English proficiency under section
124D.59, subdivision 2, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a), clause (6), and this paragraph
by demonstrating an intermediate-low level of proficiency in the students' first learned language,
in English, or in another, third language.

subject of a pardon, the business screening service shall promptly delete the record.
     (c) A business screening service may terminate an investigation of a disputed record if the

individual who is the subject of the record for a penalty of $1,000 or actual damages caused by the
violation, whichever is greater, plus costs and disbursements and reasonable attorney fees.

    Subd. 7. Absent days. (a) Child care providers may not be reimbursed for more than 25 full-day
absent days per child, excluding holidays, in a fiscal year, or for more than ten consecutive full-day
absent days, unless the child has a documented medical condition that causes more frequent
absences. Absences due to a documented medical condition of a parent or sibling who lives in the
same residence as the child receiving child care assistance do not count against the 25-day absent
day limit in a fiscal year. Documentation of medical conditions must be on the forms and submitted
according to the timelines established by the commissioner. A public health official or school nurse
may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a provider sends a child home early due
to a medical reason, including, but not limited to, fever or contagious illness, the child care center
director or lead teacher may verify the illness in lieu of a medical practitioner. If a child attends for
part of the time authorized to be in care in a day, but is absent for part of the time authorized to be
in care in that same day, the absent time will be reimbursed but the time will not count toward the
ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits. Children in families where at least one parent
is under the age of 21, does not have a high school or general equivalency diploma, and is a student
in a school district or another similar program that provides or arranges for child care, as well as
parenting, social services, career and employment support, and academic support to achieve high
school graduation, may be exempt from the absent day limits upon request of the program and
approval of the county. If a child attends part of an authorized day, payment to the provider must
be for the full amount of care authorized for that day. Child care providers may only be reimbursed
for absent days if the provider has a written policy for child absences and charges all other families
in care for similar absences.
    (b) Child care providers must be reimbursed for up to ten federal or state holidays or designated
holidays per year when the provider charges all families for these days and the holiday or designated
holiday falls on a day when the child is authorized to be in attendance. Parents may substitute other
cultural or religious holidays for the ten recognized state and federal holidays. Holidays do not count
toward the ten consecutive or 25 cumulative absent day limits.
    (c) A family or child care provider may not be assessed an overpayment for an absent day
payment unless (1) there was an error in the amount of care authorized for the family, (2) all of
the allowed full-day absent payments for the child have been paid, or (3) the family or provider did
not timely report a change as required under law.
    (d) The provider and family must receive notification of the number of absent days used upon
initial provider authorization for a family and when the family has used 15 cumulative absent days.
Upon statewide implementation of the Minnesota Electronic Child Care System, the provider and
family authorization for a family and ongoing notification of the number of absent days used as of
the date of the notification.
   (e) A county may pay for more absent days than the statewide absent day policy established
under this subdivision, if current market practice in the county justifies payment for those additional
days. County policies for payment of absent days in excess of the statewide absent day policy and

   Sections 182.6551 to 182.6553 may be cited as the "Safe Patient Handling Act."
   Sec. 2. [182.6552] DEFINITIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Direct patient care worker. "Direct patient care worker" means an individual
doing the job of directly providing physical care to patients including nurses, as defined by section
148.171, who provide physical care to patients.
   Subd. 2. Health care facility. "Health care facility" means a hospital as defined in section 144.50,
622                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [24TH DAY

subdivision 2, a medical facility as defined in section 144.561, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), a nursing
home as defined in section 144A.01, subdivision 5, an outpatient clinic, or a physician's office.
    Subd. 3. Safe patient handling. "Safe patient handling" means a process, based on scientific
evidence on causes of injuries, that uses safe patient handling equipment rather than people to
transfer, move, and reposition patients in all health care facilities to reduce workplace injuries. This
process also reduces the risk of injury to patients.
   Subd. 4. Safe patient handling equipment. "Safe patient handling equipment" means
engineering controls, lifting and transfer aids, or mechanical assistive devices used by nurses and
other direct patient care workers instead of manual lifting to perform the acts of lifting, transferring,
and repositioning health care facility patients and residents.
      Sec. 3. [182.6553] SAFE PATIENT HANDLING PROGRAM.
    Subdivision 1. Safe patient handling program required. (a) By January 1, 2008, every licensed
health care facility in the state shall adopt a written safe patient handling program establishing the
facility's plan to achieve by January 1, 2011, the goal of minimizing manual lifting of patients by
nurses and other direct patient care workers by utilizing safe patient handling equipment.
      (b) The program shall address:
      (1) assessment of hazards with regard to patient handling;
      (2) the acquisition of an adequate supply of appropriate safe patient handling equipment;
   (3) initial and ongoing training of nurses and other direct patient care workers on the use of this
equipment;
   (4) procedures to ensure that physical plant modifications and major construction projects are
consistent with program goals; and
      (5) periodic evaluations of the safe patient handling program.
    Subd. 2. Safe patient handling committee. (a) By July 1, 2008, every licensed health care
facility in the state shall establish a safe patient handling committee either by creating a new
committee or assigning the functions of a safe patient handling committee to an existing committee.
    (b) Membership of a safe patient handling committee or an existing committee must meet the
following requirements:
      (1) at least half the members shall be nonmanagerial nurses and other direct patient care workers;
and
    (2) in a health care facility where nurses and other direct patient care workers are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement, the union shall select the committee members proportionate to its
representation of nonmanagement nurses and other direct patient care workers.
   (c) A health care organization with more than one covered health care facility may establish
a committee at each facility or one committee to serve this function for all the facilities. If the
organization chooses to have one overall committee for multiple facilities, at least half of the
members of the overall committee must be nonmanagerial nurses and other direct patient care

workers and each facility must be represented on the committee.
  (d) Employees who serve on a safe patient handling committee must be compensated by their
employer for all hours spent on committee business.
    Subd. 3. Facilities with existing programs. A facility that has already adopted a safe patient
handling policy and established a safe patient handling committee by January 1, 2008, that satisfies
the requirements of this section is considered to be in compliance with those requirements. The
committee must continue to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 2, paragraph (b), on an ongoing
basis.
   Subd. 4. Committee duties. A safe patient handling committee shall:
   (1) complete a patient handling hazard assessment that:
   (i) considers patient handling tasks, types of nursing units, patient populations, and the physical
environment of patient care areas;
   (ii) identifies problems and solutions;
   (iii) identifies areas of highest risk for lifting injuries; and
   (iv) recommends a mechanism to report, track, and analyze injury trends;
   (2) make recommendations on the purchase, use, and maintenance of an adequate supply of
appropriate safe patient handling equipment;
    (3) make recommendations on training of nurses and other direct patient care workers on use of
safe patient handling equipment, initially when the equipment arrives at the facility and periodically
afterwards;
   (4) conduct annual evaluations of the safe patient handling implementation plan and progress
toward goals established in the safe patient handling plan; and
   (5) recommend procedures to ensure that, when remodeling of patient care areas occurs, the
plans incorporate safe patient handling equipment or the physical space and construction design
needed to accommodate safe patient handling equipment at a later date.
   Subd. 5. Training materials. The commissioner shall make training materials on
implementation of this section available to all health care facilities at no cost as part of the training
and education duties of the commissioner under section 182.673.

   (2) increase the maximum safety grant award to 50 percent of project costs up to a maximum
grant award of $40,000.
   Sec. 6. STUDY.
    The commissioner of labor and industry shall study ways to require workers' compensation
insurers to recognize compliance with section 3 in the workers' compensation premiums of health
care and long-term care facilities. The commissioner shall report by January 15, 2008, the results
of the study to the chairs of the policy committees of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over
