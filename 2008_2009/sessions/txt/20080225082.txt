    (d) An ambulance service providing advanced life support shall have a written agreement with
its medical director to ensure medical control for patient care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The terms of the agreement shall include a written policy on the administration of medical control
for the service. The policy shall address the following issues:
    (i) two-way communication for physician direction of ambulance service personnel;
    (ii) patient triage, treatment, and transport;
    (iii) use of standing orders; and
    (iv) the means by which medical control will be provided 24 hours a day.
   The agreement shall be signed by the licensee's medical director and the licensee or the licensee's
designee and maintained in the files of the licensee.
    (e) When an ambulance service provides advanced life support, the authority of an EMT-P,
Minnesota registered nurse-EMT, or Minnesota registered physician assistant-EMT to determine
the delivery of patient care prevails over the authority of an EMT.
    (f) Upon application from an ambulance service that includes evidence demonstrating hardship,
the board may grant a variance from the staff requirements in paragraph (a), clause (1), and may
authorize an advanced life support ambulance to be staffed by a first responder driver with a
paramedic for all emergency calls and interfacility transfers. The variance shall apply to advanced
life support ambulance services until the ambulance service renews its license. When the variance
expires, an ambulance service may apply for a new variance under this paragraph. This paragraph
applies only to an ambulance service whose primary service area is located outside the metropolitan
counties listed in section 473.121, subdivision 4, and outside the cities of Duluth, Mankato,
Moorhead, Rochester, and St. Cloud, or an ambulance based in a community with a population of
less than 1,000 persons.
    (g) After an initial emergency ambulance call, each subsequent emergency ambulance response,
until the initial ambulance is again available, and interfacility transfers, may be staffed by one
registered first responder driver and an EMT or paramedic. This paragraph applies only to an
ambulance service whose primary service area is located outside the metropolitan counties listed in
section 473.121, subdivision 4, and outside the cities of Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester,
and St. Cloud, or an ambulance based in a community with a population of less than 1,000 persons."

      Remember: It is important that you learn as much as you can about foreclosure and your
      situation. Find out about all your options before you make any agreements with anyone about
      the foreclosure of your home.
      Getting Help
      As soon as possible, you should contact your lender at the above number to talk about things
      you might be able to do to prevent foreclosure. You should also consider contacting the
      foreclosure prevention counselor in your area. A foreclosure prevention counselor can answer
      your questions, offer free advice, and help you create a plan which makes sense for your
      situation.
      Contact the Minnesota Home Ownership Center at 651-659-9336 or 866-462-6466 or
      www.hocmn.org to get the phone number and location of the nearest counseling organization.
      Call today. The longer you wait, the fewer options you may have for a desirable result.
      Information About the Foreclosure Process
      You do not need to move at the time of the sheriff's sale. After the sheriff's sale you have
      the right to "redeem." Redeem means that you pay off the entire loan amount plus fees to
      keep your house. You can keep living in your home for a period of time. This is called a
      "redemption period." The redemption period is [insert number of months] months after the
      sheriff's sale. This redemption period is your chance to try and sell your home or refinance
      it with a different loan. You can also pay the redemption amount with any other funds you
      have available. At the end of the redemption period you will have to leave your home. If you
      do not, the person or company that bid on your home at the sheriff's sale has the right to file
      an eviction against you in district court."
   Sec. 11. [580.042] FORECLOSURE ADVICE NOTICE TO TENANT.
   Subdivision 1. Applicability. This section applies to foreclosure of mortgages under this chapter.
    Subd. 2. Form of delivery of notice. The notice required by this section must be in 14-point
boldface type and must be printed on colored paper that is other than the color of the notice of
foreclosure and of the notice to be given under section 580.041, subdivision 1b, and that does not
obscure or overshadow the content of the notice. The title of the notice must be in 20-point boldface
type. The notice must be on its own page.
    Subd. 3. Content of notice. The notice required by this section must appear substantially as
follows.
                                             "Foreclosure: Advice to Tenants
   You are renting in a property that is in foreclosure. Minnesota law requires that we send you this
6668                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [82ND DAY

notice about the foreclosure process. Please read it carefully.
     The mortgage foreclosure does not change the terms of your lease. You and your landlord
must continue to follow the terms of your lease, including the rights and responsibilities of
you and your landlord. You must keep paying rent unless you have a legal reason to withhold
it. Your landlord must keep the property repaired. Utilities must be paid under the terms of
your lease or under state law.
    Moving out of the property early might be a violation of your lease. The date of the sheriff's
foreclosure sale is in the attached foreclosure notice. In most cases you do not need to move from
the property before the sheriff's foreclosure sale. Read your lease to see if it says anything about
foreclosure and about the rights you may have if the property is in foreclosure. If you have a
month-to-month lease, the foreclosure notice does not change the rules for ending your lease. You
and your landlord must still give legal notice to end your lease.
    In most cases, your landlord has six months after the date of the sheriff's foreclosure sale to pay
off the mortgage. This is called the "redemption period." Read the attached foreclosure notice to
determine the length of the redemption period. You cannot be asked to move during the redemption
period except for lease violations or if your lease expires during the redemption period. If your
landlord stops the foreclosure, you may not have to move from the property. If your landlord does
not stop the foreclosure, there will be a new owner of the property at the end of the redemption
period.
    The new owner may have the legal right to ask you to move even if your lease is not over. But,
the new owner must still give you a written notice stating that the new owner wants you to move.
   Do not wait to get information about foreclosure. Mortgage foreclosure is a complicated
process. It is important you learn about your rights as a renter when there is a mortgage foreclosure.
You may have fewer options if you wait too long. There are government agencies and nonprofit
organizations that you may contact for helpful information about the foreclosure process. For the
name and telephone number of an organization near you, please call the legal aid office or bar
association office in your county. You also can find information on tenant rights at HOME Line at
(866) 866-3546 and Law Help Minnesota at http://www.LawHelpMN.org. The state of Minnesota
does not guarantee the advice of these agencies and organizations."
    Subd. 4. Affidavit. Any person may establish compliance with or inapplicability of this
section by recording, with the county recorder or registrar of titles, an affidavit by a person having
knowledge of the facts, stating that the notice required by this section has been delivered in
compliance with this section. The affidavit and a certified copy of a recorded affidavit is prima
facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. The affidavit may be recorded regarding any
foreclosure sale, including foreclosure sales that occurred prior to August 1, 2008, and may be
recorded separately or as part of the record of a foreclosure.
    Subd. 5. Validation of foreclosure sales; remedy for violation. (a) No mortgage foreclosure
sale under this chapter is invalid because of failure to comply with this section.
    (b) The remedy for a violation of this section is limited to actual damages caused by the violation,
not to exceed $1,000, and is available only to the tenant of the mortgaged premises who occupied
the mortgaged premises during the redemption period of the mortgagor. Any legal action brought to
enforce the provisions of this section must be commenced by the last day of the redemption period

of the mortgagor. A person is not liable in an action for a violation of this section if the person
shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from
a bona fide error and the person adopted and maintained reasonable procedures to avoid the error.
A plaintiff does not have cause of action if the defendant has complied with section 580.03.

    Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.12, is amended to read:
    580.12 CERTIFICATE OF SALE; RECORD; EFFECT.
    When any sale of real property is made under a power of sale contained in any mortgage, the
officer shall make and deliver to the purchaser a certificate, executed in the same manner as a
conveyance, containing:
    (1) a description of the mortgage;
    (2) a description of the property sold;
    (3) the price paid for each parcel sold;
    (4) the time and place of the sale, and the name of the purchaser;
    (5) the interest rate in effect on the date of the sheriff's sale; and
    ­
    (5
     ­­) (6) the time allowed by law for redemption, provided that if the redemption period stated
in the certificate is five weeks and a longer redemption period was stated in the published notice
of foreclosure sale, a certified copy of the court order entered under section 582.032, authorizing
reduction of the redemption period to five weeks, must be attached to the certificate.
    A certificate which states a five-week redemption period must be recorded within ten days after
the sale; any other certificate must be recorded within 20 days after the sale. When so recorded, upon
expiration of the time for redemption, the certificate shall operate as a conveyance to the purchaser
or the purchaser's assignee of all the right, title, and interest of the mortgagor in and to the premises
named therein at the date of such mortgage, without any other conveyance. A certificate must not
contain a time allowed for redemption that is less than the time specified by section 580.23, 582.032,
or 582.32, whichever applies.

assigns, within six months after such sale, except as otherwise provided in subdivision 2 or section

for redemption by the mortgagor upon receipt by the sheriff, prior to expiration of the redemption
period, of written confirmation from the holder of the sheriff's certificate or the attorney for the
holder of the sheriff's certificate that the holder of the sheriff's certificate has agreed to accept a
specific sum less than the full amount due for redemption.
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 580.24, is amended to read:
   580.24 REDEMPTION BY CREDITOR.
    (a) If no redemption is made by the mortgagor, the mortgagor's personal representatives or
assigns, the most senior creditor having a legal or equitable lien upon the mortgaged premises,
or some part of it, subsequent to the foreclosed mortgage, may redeem within seven days after
the expiration of the redemption period determined under section 580.23 or 582.032, whichever is
applicable; and each subsequent creditor having a lien may redeem, in the order of priority of their
respective liens, within seven days after the time allowed the prior lienholder by paying the amount
required under this section. However, no creditor is entitled to redeem unless, w ­­t
                                                                                    i­h

more prior to the expiration of the period allowed for redemption by the mortgagor, the creditor:
   (1) records with each county recorder and registrar of titles where the foreclosed mortgage is
recorded a notice of the creditor's intention to redeem;

                                  e with each county recorder and registrar of titles where the notice
of the creditor's intention to redeem is recorded all documents necessary to create the lien on the
mortgaged premises and to evidence the creditor's ownership of the lien, including a copy of any
money judgment necessary to create the lien; and
    (3) after complying with clauses (1) and (2), delivers to the sheriff who conducted the foreclosure
sale or the sheriff's successor in office a copy of each of the documents required to be recorded under
clauses (1) and (2), with the office, date and time of filing for record stated on the first page of each
document.
    The sheriff shall maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff and shall
note the date of delivery on each document. The sheriff may charge a fee of $100 for the documents
delivered to the sheriff relating to each lien. The sheriff shall maintain copies of documents delivered
to the sheriff for a period of six months after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
   (b) Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, and the first day following the expiration of the prior

redemption period must be included in computing the seven-day redemption period. When the
last day of the period falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, that day must be omitted from
the computation. The order of redemption by judgment creditors subsequent to the foreclosed
mortgage shall be determined by the order in which their judgments were entered as memorials
on the certificate of title for the foreclosed premises or docketed in the office of the district
court administrator if the property is not registered under chapter 508 or 508A, regardless of the
homestead status of the property. All mechanic's lienholders who have coordinate liens shall have
one combined seven-day period to redeem.
    (c) The amount required to redeem from the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale is the amount
required under section 580.23. The amount required to redeem from a person holding a certificate
of redemption is:
     (1) the amount paid to redeem as shown on the certificate of redemption; plus
     (2) interest on that amount to the date of redemption; plus
    (3) the amount claimed due on the person's lien, as shown on the affidavit under section 580.25,
clause (3).
    The amount required to redeem may be paid to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale or
the certificate of redemption, as the case may be, or to the sheriff for the holder.
     Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.25, is amended to read:
     580.25 REDEMPTION, HOW MADE.
     Redemption shall be made as provided in this section.
   The person desiring to redeem shall pay the amount required by law for the redemption, and
shall produce to the person or officer receiving the redemption payment:

or files evidencing any other lien under which the person claims a right to redeem,                         ­­­­

Additional fees and charges may be claimed due only as provided in section 582.03.
    If redemption is made to the sheriff, the sheriff may charge a fee of $250 for issuing the certificate
of redemption and any related service. No other fee may be charged by the sheriff for a redemption.
    Within 24 hours after a redemption is made, the person redeeming shall cause the documents
so required to be produced to be fi

may receive fees as prescribed in section 357.18 or 508.82. If the redemption is made at any place
other than the county seat, it is sufficient forthwith to deposit the documents in the nearest post
office, addressed to the recorder or registrar of titles, with the postage prepaid. A person recording
documents produced for redemption shall, on the same day, deliver copies of the documents to the
sheriff for public inspection. The sheriff may receive a fee of $20 for the documents delivered
following a redemption. The sheriff shall note the date of delivery on the documents and shall
maintain for public inspection all documents delivered to the sheriff for a period of six months
after the end of the mortgagor's redemption period.
   Sec. 18. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.28, is amended to read:
   580.28 ACTION TO SET ASIDE MORTGAGE; FORECLOSURE; REDEMPTION.
    When an action is brought wherein it is claimed that any mortgage as to the plaintiff or person
for whose benefit the action is brought is fraudulent or void, or has been paid or discharged, in
whole or in part, or the relative priority or the validity of liens is disputed, if such mortgage has
been foreclosed by advertisement, and the time for redemption from the foreclosure sale will expire
before final judgment in such action, the plaintiff or beneficiary having the right to redeem, for the
purpose of saving such right in case the action fails, may deposit with the sheriff before the time of
redemption expires the amount for which the mortgaged premises were sold, with interest thereon to
the time of deposit, together with a bond to the holder of the sheriff's certificate of sale, in an amount
and with sureties to be approved by the sheriff, conditioned to pay all interest that may accrue or be
allowed on such deposit if the action fail. The person shall, in writing, notify such sheriff that the
person claims the mortgage to be fraudulent or void, or to have been paid or discharged, in whole or
in part, as the case may be, and that such action is pending, and direct the sheriff to retain such money
and bond until final judgment. In case such action fails, such deposit shall operate as a redemption
of the premises from such foreclosure sale, and entitle the plaintiff to a certificate thereof. Such
foreclosure, deposit, bond, and notice shall be brought to the attention of the court by supplemental
complaint in the action, and the judgment shall determine the validity of the foreclosure sale, and
the rights of the parties to the moneys and bond so deposited, which shall be paid and delivered by
the sheriff as directed by such judgment upon delivery to the sheriff of a certified copy thereof. The
remedy herein provided shall be in addition to other remedies now existing.
   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 580.30, is amended to read:
   580.30 MORTGAGES, WHEN REINSTATED.
    Subdivision 1. Reinstatement. In any proceedings for the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage,
whether by action or by advertisement, if at any time before the sale of the premises under such
foreclosure the mortgagor, the owner, or any holder of any subsequent encumbrance or lien, or any
one for them, shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of the mortgage so being foreclosed, or to
the attorney foreclosing the same, or to the sheriff of the county, the amount actually due thereon
and constituting the default actually existing in the conditions of the mortgage at the time of the
82ND DAY]                              MONDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 2008                                                     6673

commencement of the foreclosure proceedings, including insurance, delinquent taxes, if any, upon
the premises, interest to date of payment, cost of publication and services of process or notices,
attorney's fees not exceeding $150 or one-half of the attorney's fees authorized by section 582.01,
whichever is greater, together with other lawful disbursements necessarily incurred in connection
with the proceedings by the party foreclosing, then, and in that event, the mortgage shall be fully
reinstated and further proceedings in such foreclosure shall be thereupon abandoned.
    Subd. 2. Request by sheriff. Upon written request by the sheriff, the holder of the mortgage
or the holder's legal representative shall provide to the sheriff within seven days of the date of
the request by the sheriff to the foreclosing attorney: (1) the current payoff amount, showing
outstanding principal, interest, and a daily interest accrual amount, (2) an itemized schedule of the
current amounts necessary to reinstate the mortgage, and (3) the identity of the person or entity
with authority to act on behalf of the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
If the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative fails to respond to the sheriff's
request within seven days of the date of the request, the sheriff shall postpone the sheriff's sale and
the sheriff shall announce at the sheriff's sale the postponement of the sale. The postponement does
not need to be published. If the request by the sheriff is made seven days or less before the sheriff's
sale, the holder of the mortgage or the holder's representative shall make a good faith effort to
respond to the sheriff before the sheriff's sale, but the sheriff may conduct the sheriff's sale without
a response from the holder of the mortgage or the holder's legal representative.
    Sec. 20. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 581.10, is amended to read:
    581.10 REDEMPTION BY MORTGAGOR, CREDITOR.
     The mortgagor, or those claiming under the mortgagor, within the time specified in section
580.23 or 582.032, whichever applies, after the date of the order of confirmation, may redeem the
premises sold, or any separate portion thereof, by paying the amount bid therefor, with interest

                                ­n
sale was held at any time prior to expiration of the mortgagor's redemption period. Upon written
request by the sheriff, the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption shall provide
an affidavit of allowable costs to the sheriff within seven days of the date of the request by the
sheriff. If the mortgagor does not redeem within seven days after the affidavit is filed, the holder of
the sheriff's certificate may file a supplemental affidavit if additional allowable costs are incurred
during the redemption period. If the holder of the sheriff's certificate or certificate of redemption
fails to respond to the sheriff's request within seven days, the sheriff may calculate a redemption
amount pursuant to section 580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that
amount. If the time allowed to redeem is less than seven days from the expiration of the redemption
period, the sheriff shall make a reasonable effort to request the affidavit of allowable costs in
writing from the holder of the sheriff's certificate, its agent, or attorney before issuing a certificate
of redemption. If the affidavit of allowable costs is not provided more than one business day before
the expiration of the redemption period, at any time one business day or less before the expiration
of the redemption period, the sheriff may calculate a redemption amount pursuant to section
580.23, subdivision 1, and issue a certificate of redemption for that amount. The amount calculated
by the sheriff, absent malfeasance by the sheriff, binds the holder of the sheriff's certificate even if
the amount calculated by the sheriff is less than the actual amount due.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for excessive costs. At any time within one year after the expiration of the
mortgagor's redemption period, the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns may recover from the holder
of the sheriff's certificate three times the amount of any sums declared as costs or disbursements
on the affidavit of allowable costs but not actually paid by the holder, or three times the amount of
any sums determined to exceed a reasonable cost for the declared item where the excess has been
retained by the lender, unless the disputed amounts are paid to the redeeming party, heirs, or assigns
prior to entry of judgment.
    Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 582.031, is amended to read:
    582.031 LIMITED RIGHT OF ENTRY.
    Subdivision 1. Right of entry. If premises described in a mortgage or sheriff's certificate are
vacant or unoccupied, the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate or the holder's agents and
contractors may, but is under no obligation to, enter upon the premises to protect the premises
from waste, until the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate receives notice that the premises
are occupied. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate does not become a mortgagee in

possession by taking actions authorized under this section. An affidavit of the sheriff, the holder
of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate, or a person acting on behalf of the holder, describing the
premises and stating that the same are vacant or unoccupied, is prima facie evidence of the facts
stated in the affidavit and is entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder or the registrar
of titles in the county where the premises are located, if it contains a legal description of the premises.
    Subd. 2. Authorized actions. The holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate may take the
following actions to protect the premises from waste:  ­ or from falling below minimum community
standards for public safety and sanitation: make reasonable periodic inspections, install or change
locks on doors and windows, board windows, install an alarm system, ­    p­ro

and otherwise prevent or minimize damage to the premises from the elements, vandalism, trespass,
or other illegal activities. If the holder of the mortgage or sheriff's certificate installs or changes
locks under this section, a key to the premises must be promptly delivered to the mortgagor or any
person lawfully claiming through the mortgagor, upon request.
    Subd. 3. Costs. All costs incurred by the holder of the mortgage to protect the premises from
waste or from falling below minimum community standards for public safety and sanitation may be
added to the principal balance of the mortgage. The costs may bear interest to the extent provided in
the mortgage and may be added to the redemption price if the costs are incurred after a foreclosure
