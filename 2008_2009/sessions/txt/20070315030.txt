   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 65B.49, subdivision 5a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5a. Rental vehicles. (a) Every plan of reparation security, wherever issued, insuring
a natural person as named insured, covering private passenger vehicles as defined under section
65B.001, subdivision 3, and pickup trucks and vans as defined under section 168.011 must: (1)
provide that all of the obligation for damage and loss of use to a rented private passenger vehicle,
including pickup trucks and vans as defined under section 168.011, and rented trucks with a
registered gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or less would be covered by the property damage
liability portion of the plan; and (2) extend the plan's basic economic loss benefits, residual liability
insurance, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages to the operation or use of the rented
motor vehicle. This subdivision does not apply to plans of reparation security covering only motor
vehicles registered under section 168.10, subdivision 1a, 1b, 1c, or 1d, or recreational vehicles
as defined under section 168.011. The obligation of the plan must not be contingent on fault or
negligence. In all cases where the plan's property damage liability coverage is less than $35,000,
the coverage available under the subdivision must be $35,000. Other than as described in this
paragraph o ­­
             r­­n
               i­; paragraph (i), clause (2); or paragraph (j), nothing in this section amends or alters
the provisions of the plan of reparation security as to primacy of the coverages in this section.
   (b) A vehicle is rented for purposes of this subdivision:
   (1) if the rate for the use of the vehicle is determined on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis; or
   (2) during the time that a vehicle is loaned as a replacement for a vehicle being serviced or
repaired regardless of whether the customer is charged a fee for the use of the vehicle.
    A vehicle is not rented for the purposes of this subdivision if the rate for the vehicle's use is
determined on a period longer than one month or if the term of the rental agreement is longer than
one month. A vehicle is not rented for purposes of this subdivision if the rental agreement has a
purchase or buyout option or otherwise functions as a substitute for purchase of the vehicle.
   (c) The policy or certificate issued by the plan must inform the insured of the application of the
plan to private passenger rental vehicles, including pickup trucks and vans as defined under section
168.011, and that the insured may not need to purchase additional coverage from the rental company.
    (d) Where an insured has two or more vehicles covered by a plan or plans of reparation security
containing the rented motor vehicle coverage required under paragraph (a), the insured may select
the plan the insured wishes to collect from and that plan is entitled to a pro rata contribution from the
other plan or plans based upon the property damage limits of liability. If the person renting the motor
vehicle is also covered by the person's employer's insurance policy or the employer's automobile
self-insurance plan, the reparation obligor under the employer's policy or self-insurance plan has
primary responsibility to pay claims arising from use of the rented vehicle.
    (e) A notice advising the insured of rental vehicle coverage must be given by the reparation
obligor to each current insured with the first renewal notice after January 1, 1989. The notice must
be approved by the commissioner of commerce. The commissioner may specify the form of the
notice.
    (f) When a motor vehicle is rented in this state, there must be attached to the rental contract
a separate form containing a written notice in at least 10-point bold type, if printed, or in capital

described in paragraph (a), using the definition of "rented" provided in paragraph (b).
    (2) Notwithstanding section 169.09, subdivision 5a, an owner of a rented motor vehicle is not
vicariously liable for legal damages resulting from the operation of the rented motor vehicle in an
amount greater than $100,000 because of bodily injury to one person in any one accident and, subject
to the limit for one person, $300,000 because of injury to two or more persons in any one accident,
and $50,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident, if the
owner of the rented motor vehicle has in effect, at the time of the accident, a policy of insurance
or self-insurance, as provided in section 65B.48, subdivision 3, covering losses up to at least the
amounts set forth in this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph alters or affects the obligations of an
owner of a rented motor vehicle to comply with the requirements of compulsory insurance through
a policy of insurance as provided in section 65B.48, subdivision 2, or through self-insurance as
provided in section 65B.48, subdivision 3, which policy of insurance or self-insurance must apply
whenever the operator is not covered by a plan of reparation security as provided under paragraph
(a); or with the obligations arising from section 72A.125 for products sold in conjunction with the
rental of a motor vehicle. Nothing in this paragraph alters or affects liability, other than vicarious
liability, of an owner of a rented motor vehicle.
    (3) The dollar amounts stated in this paragraph shall be adjusted for inflation based upon the
Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, known as the CPI-U, published by the United States
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The dollar amounts stated in this paragraph are based upon the value
of that index for July 1995, which is the reference base index for purposes of this paragraph. The
dollar amounts in this paragraph shall change effective January 1 of each odd-numbered year based
upon the percentage difference between the index for July of the preceding year and the reference
base index, calculated to the nearest whole percentage point. The commissioner shall announce and
publish, on or before September 30 of the preceding year, the changes in the dollar amounts required

by this paragraph to take effect on January 1 of each odd-numbered year. The commissioner shall
use the most recent revision of the July index available as of September 1. Changes in the dollar
amounts must be in increments of $5,000, and no change shall be made in a dollar amount until the
change in the index requires at least a $5,000 change. If the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics
changes the base year upon which the CPI-U is based, the commissioner shall make the calculations
necessary to convert from the old base year to the new base year. If the CPI-U is discontinued, the
commissioner shall use the available index that is most similar to the CPI-U.

    "Section 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
    The legislature finds that it is the public policy of the state to ensure that all children are safe
from abuse and neglect, live in permanent and stable homes where they are nurtured, and have the
opportunity to reach their full potential. To further this public policy, it is the intent of the legislature
to establish a child safety system that has, as its goal, three performance-based outcomes: child
safety, permanency, and well-being. A child safety fund is created to implement, maintain, and
provide incentives to counties for the continuous improvement of the child safety system.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256M.30, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Service plan submitted to commissioner. Effective January 1, 2004, and
each two-year period thereafter, each county must have a biennial service plan approved by the
commissioner in order to receive funds. Only one biennial service plan is required under this
chapter, regardless of whether counties receive funding under this chapter, chapter 256N, or both.
Counties may submit multicounty or regional service plans.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256M.30, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

available in the community to address those needs;
    (2) strategies the county will implement to meet the child safety system performance standards
in the child safety system in chapter 256N;
   (3) strategies the county will pursue to achieve the performance targets. Strategies must include
specification of how funds under this section and other community resources will be used to achieve
desired performance targets;
   ­
   (3
    ­­) (4) a description of the county's process to solicit public input and a summary of that input;
    ­
    (4
     ­­) (5) beginning with the service plans submitted for the period from January 1, 2006,
through December 31, 2007, performance targets on statewide indicators for each county to
measure outcomes of children's mental health, and child safety, permanency, and well-being. The
commissioner shall consult with counties and other stakeholders to develop these indicators and
collect baseline data to inform the establishment of individual county performance targets for the
2006-2007 biennium and subsequent plans; and
    ­(5
      ­­) (6) a budget for services to be provided with funds under this section. The county must budget
at least 40 percent of funds appropriated under sections 256M.01 to 256M.80 for services to ensure
the mental health, safety, permanency, and well-being of children from low-income families. The
commissioner may reduce the portion of child and community services funds that must be budgeted

Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning July
1, 2003, and until two years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor participation
in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term care system
providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and in-home services

to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver, Hennepin, and Scott
Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion of the developmental
disability pilot project. This paragraph expires two years after the implementation date of the pilot
project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until January 1,
2008, expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited
to the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for
home and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would
have been incurred under the fee-for-service program. The commissioner shall develop and issue
a quality of care impact statement to include: any resulting reduction in the quality and quantity
of county safety net services for disabled persons; any resulting county employee job losses; a
comparison of the qualifications and experience of existing county case managers versus contracted
vendors; a cost-benefit analysis showing the costs and projected savings of a prepaid medical
plan in comparison to fee-paid services; and any conflicts of interest. In developing program

specifications for expansion of integrated programs, the commissioner shall involve and consult the
state-level stakeholder group established in subdivision 28, paragraph (d), including consultation
on whether and how to include home and community-based waiver programs. Plans for further
expansion of MnDHO projects shall be presented to the chairs of the house and senate committees
with jurisdiction over health and human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 28, is amended to read:
   Subd. 28. Medicare special needs plans; medical assistance basic health care. (a) The
commissioner may contract with qualified Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide
medical assistance basic health care services to persons with disabilities, including those with
developmental disabilities. Basic health care services include:
    (1) those services covered by the medical assistance state plan except for ICF/MR services,
home and community-based waiver services, case management for persons with developmental
disabilities under section 256B.0625, subdivision 20a, and personal care and certain home care
services defined by the commissioner in consultation with the stakeholder group established under
paragraph (d); and
    (2) basic health care services may also include risk for up to 100 days of nursing facility services
for persons who reside in a noninstitutional setting and home health services related to rehabilitation
as defined by the commissioner after consultation with the stakeholder group.
   The commissioner may exclude other medical assistance services from the basic health care
benefit set. Enrollees in these plans can access any excluded services on the same basis as other
medical assistance recipients who have not enrolled.
   Unless a person is otherwise required to enroll in managed care, enrollment in these plans for
Medicaid services must be voluntary. For purposes of this subdivision, automatic enrollment with
an option to opt out is not voluntary enrollment.
    (b) Beginning January 1, 2007, the commissioner may contract with qualified Medicare special
needs plans to provide basic health care services under medical assistance to persons who are
dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid and those Social Security beneficiaries eligible
for Medicaid but in the waiting period for Medicare. The commissioner shall consult with the
stakeholder group under paragraph ­ (d
                                     ­­) (e) in developing program specifications for these services.
The commissioner shall report to the chairs of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction
over health and human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007, on implementation of
these programs and the need for increased funding for the ombudsman for managed care and other
consumer assistance and protections needed due to enrollment in managed care of persons with
disabilities. Payment for Medicaid services provided under this subdivision for the months of May
and June will be made no earlier than July 1 of the same calendar year.
    (c) Beginning January 1, 2008, the commissioner may expand contracting under this subdivision
to all persons with disabilities not otherwise required to enroll in managed care.

    (d) By February 1, 2009, the commissioner shall report to the chairs of the house and senate
committees with jurisdiction over health and human services policy and finance on the initial results
of implementation of contracts with qualified Medicare special needs plans to provide basic health
care services under medical assistance to persons who are dually eligible for both Medicare and
Medicaid. This report shall include an overall assessment of the impact on quality of care including
actual costs and benefits.
    (e) The commissioner shall establish a state-level stakeholder group to provide advice on
managed care programs for persons with disabilities, including both MnDHO and contracts with
special needs plans that provide basic health care services as described in paragraphs (a) and
(b). The stakeholder group shall include representatives of the counties and labor organizations
representing county social service workers, members, consumer advocates, and providers, and
provide advice on program expansions under this subdivision and subdivision 23, including:
   (1) implementation efforts;
   (2) consumer protections; and
   (3) program specifications such as quality assurance measures, data collection and reporting,
and evaluation of costs, quality, and results.
