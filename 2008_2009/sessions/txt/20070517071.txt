POSTRETIREMENT ADJUSTMENT; LIMITATIONS.
    (a) Notwithstanding any provision of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 354A, to the contrary, for
calendar years 2008 and 2009 and for postretirement adjustments initially payable on January 1,
2008, or January 1, 2009, as a pilot program this section supersedes Minnesota Statutes, section
354A.29, subdivisions 3 and 4, and the applicable bylaw provisions of the St. Paul Teachers
Retirement Fund Association.
    (b) The postretirement adjustment under the pilot program must be determined by the executive
director and approved by the board annually using the procedures under this section.
    (c) On January 1, each eligible person who has accrued or received an annuity or benefit under
the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or this chapter for at least three full calendar months as
of the end of the calendar year is eligible to receive a postretirement adjustment that is payable the
following January 1.
    (d) A percentage adjustment must be computed and paid under this paragraph to eligible persons
under paragraph (c). This adjustment is determined by reference to the Consumer Price Index for
urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
within the United States Department of Labor each year as part of the determination of annual
cost-of-living adjustments to recipients of federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance. For
calculations of the cost-of-living adjustment under paragraph (e), the term "average third quarter
Consumer Price Index value" means the sum of the monthly index values as initially reported by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the months of July, August, and September, divided by 3.
    (e) Before January 1 of each year, the executive director must calculate the amount of the
cost-of-living adjustment by dividing the most recent average third quarter index value by the same
average third quarter index value from the previous year, subtract one from the resulting quotient,
and express the result as a percentage amount, which must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of
one percent. The final amount may not be a negative number and may not exceed 2.5 percent if
the rate of investment return of the retirement fund either for the most recent fiscal year or for the
most recent five-year period, each calculated under the formula specified in Minnesota Statutes,
section 11A.04, clause (11), is less than 8.5 percent and may not exceed 5.0 percent if the rate
of investment return of the retirement fund both for the most recent fiscal year and for the most
recent five-year period, each calculated under the formula specified in Minnesota Statutes, section
11A.04, clause (11), are equal to or greater than 8.5 percent.
    (f) The amount calculated under paragraph (e) is the full cost-of-living adjustment to be applied
as a permanent increase to the regular payment of each eligible member on January 1 of the next
calendar year. For any eligible member whose effective date of benefit commencement occurred
during the calendar year before the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, the full increase amount
must be prorated on the basis of whole calendar quarters in benefit payment status in the calendar
year prior to the January 1 on which the cost-of-living adjustment is applied, calculated to the third
decimal place.
   (g) This pilot postretirement adjustment program does not constitute a precedent for this or any
other retirement plan.

    (a) The Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement shall study the experience of the
St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association under the temporary postretirement adjustment

Minnesota public retirement plans regarding potential or proposed postretirement adjustment
mechanism changes. Following the completion of its study, on or before January 15, 2009, the

on State and Local Government Operations and Oversight, and the chair of the senate Committee
on Finance, its findings and recommendations regarding a possible continuation, modification, or
elimination of the temporary mechanism specified in section 1.
    (b) For fiscal years 2007 and 2008, in addition to the regular actuarial valuation prepared under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.215, the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association shall have
prepared and shall file with the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement a supplemental
actuarial valuation report providing comparative data on the funded status, actuarial requirements,
contribution sufficiency or deficiency, and any other relevant results if the temporary postretirement
adjustment mechanism under section 1 was a permanent mechanism. This report must be submitted
for inclusion in the study required under paragraph (a).
   Sec. 3. REPEALER.

    (b) To reduce the risk that state general funds will be needed to pay debt service on the
state guaranteed bonds, the commissioner must require that the financing arrangements include
a coverage test satisfactory to the commissioner so that the sum of the value of the assets and
other security pledged to the payment of bonds or the rent due under any lease of the project and
taken into account by the commissioner is no less than 125 percent of the difference between the
outstanding state guaranteed bonds, and any cash collateral held in a debt service reserve account
and pledged to the payment of principal and interest for the state guaranteed bonds and no other
bonds. Assets and other security that may be taken into account include (1) net unencumbered
value of the project and any collateral or third party guaranty, including a letter of credit, pledged
or otherwise furnished by a user of the project or by a benefited airline company as security for the
payment of rent, (2) bond proceeds, including earnings thereon, and (3) prepayments of rent, after
making such adjustments the commissioner determines to be appropriate to take into account any
outstanding bonds secured by a lien on the project or rent that is prior to the lien securing the state
guaranteed bonds, but excluding any cash collateral deducted from the outstanding state guaranteed
bonds in applying the coverage test. The commissioner may adopt the method of valuing the assets
and other security as the commissioner determines to be appropriate, including valuation of the
project at its original cost less depreciation.

With the approval of the commissioner, the owner of the facility may place a mortgage or security
interest lien on the facility or any interest in or part of the facility. The mortgage is exempt from
the mortgage registry tax imposed under chapter 287. In the event of a default under the loan, lease
agreement, or other revenue agreement, the facility, or any part of the facility, may be leased or sold
to another person for any lawful purpose, subject to the approval of the commissioner. The approval
of the commissioner is not required if the bond trustee has taken control of the facility as a result of
a default.
    The ownership of the facility by the owner may create no liability of the owner for payment of
the debt service on the bonds if so determined by the commissioner. The owner may require as a
condition of entering into the lease of the facility that the lessee or other party pay all costs, expenses,
or any other obligations of ownership of the facility.
    No revenues derived from the lease of the project may be used other than for a purpose related
to the project, including its operation, administration, maintenance, improvement, or financing.

   (3) property constituting or used as a public pedestrian ramp or concourse in connection with a
public airport;
    (4) property constituting or used as a passenger check-in area or ticket sale counter, boarding
area, or luggage claim area in connection with a public airport but not the airports owned or operated
by the Metropolitan Airports Commission or cities of over 50,000 population or an airport authority
therein. Real estate owned by a municipality in connection with the operation of a public airport
and leased or used for agricultural purposes is not exempt;
   (5) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under a cooperative farming agreement made pursuant to section 97A.135; or
   (6) property leased, loaned, or otherwise made available to a private individual, corporation, or
association under section 272.68, subdivision 4.
    (c) Taxes imposed by this subdivision are payable as in the case of personal property taxes
and shall be assessed to the lessees or users of real or personal property in the same manner as
taxes assessed to owners of real or personal property, except that such taxes shall not become a
lien against the property. When due, the taxes shall constitute a debt due from the lessee or user to
the state, township, city, county, and school district for which the taxes were assessed and shall be
collected in the same manner as personal property taxes. If property subject to the tax imposed by
this subdivision is leased or used jointly by two or more persons, each lessee or user shall be jointly
and severally liable for payment of the tax.
    (d) The tax on real property of the state or any of its political subdivisions that is leased by a
private individual, association, or corporation and becomes taxable under this subdivision or other
provision of law must be assessed and collected as a personal property assessment. The taxes do not
become a lien against the real property.

71ST DAY]                                THURSDAY, MAY 17, 2007                                                 5399

    (b) For the first taxable year when the facility has been in operation for at least three consecutive
months, the credit is equal to $5,000 multiplied by the number of persons employed by the
corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the last day of the taxable year, not to exceed
the number of persons employed by the corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the date
90 days before the last day of the taxable year. For each of the succeeding four taxable years, the
credit is equal to $5,000 multiplied by the number of persons employed by the corporation on
a full-time basis at the facility on the last day of the taxable year, not to exceed the number of
persons employed by the corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the date 90 days before
the last day of the taxable year.
    (c) For the first taxable year in which the credit is allowed for the facility, the credit must not
exceed 80 percent of the wages paid to or incurred for persons employed by the taxpayer at the
facility during the taxable year. For the succeeding four taxable years, the credit must not exceed 20
percent of the wages paid to or incurred for persons employed by the taxpayer at the facility during
the taxable year. For purposes of this section, "wages" has the meaning given under section 3121(b)
of the Internal Revenue Code, except the limitation to the contribution and benefit base does not
apply.
    (d) If the credit provided under this subdivision exceeds the tax liability of the corporation for
the taxable year, the excess amount of the credit may be carried over to each of the 20 taxable years
succeeding the taxable year. The entire amount of the credit must be carried to the earliest taxable
year to which the amount may be carried. The unused portion of the credit must be carried to the
following taxable year. No credit may be carried to a taxable year more than 20 years after the
taxable year in which the credit was earned.
    (e) If an unused portion of the credit remains at the end of the carryover period under paragraph
(d), the commissioner shall refund the unused portion to the taxpayer. The provisions of this
paragraph do not apply if the corporation that earned the credit under this subdivision or a successor
in interest to the corporation filed for bankruptcy protection.

service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address shown on the application or the last
known address of the license holder. The notice must state the reasons the conditional license
was ordered and must inform the license holder of the right to request reconsideration of the
conditional license by the commissioner. The license holder may request reconsideration of the
order of conditional license by notifying the commissioner by certified mail or personal service.
The request must be made in writing. If sent by certified mail, the request must be postmarked and
sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order. If a
request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar
days after the license holder received the order. The license holder may submit with the request
for reconsideration written argument or evidence in support of the request for reconsideration.
A timely request for reconsideration shall stay imposition of the terms of the conditional license
until the commissioner issues a decision on the request for reconsideration. If the commissioner
issues a dual order of conditional license under this section and an order to pay a fine under section
245A.07, subdivision 3, the license holder has a right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14
and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The scope of the contested case hearing shall
include the fine and the conditional license. In this case, a reconsideration of the conditional license

will not be conducted under this section. If the license holder does not appeal the fine, the license
holder does not have a right to a contested case hearing and a reconsideration of the conditional
license must be conducted under this subdivision.
   The commissioner's disposition of a request for reconsideration is final and not subject to appeal
under chapter 14.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Immediate suspension expedited hearing. (a) Within five working days of receipt of
the license holder's timely appeal, the commissioner shall request assignment of an administrative
law judge. The request must include a proposed date, time, and place of a hearing. A hearing must
be conducted by an administrative law judge within 30 calendar days of the request for assignment,
unless an extension is requested by either party and granted by the administrative law judge for
good cause. The commissioner shall issue a notice of hearing by certified mail or personal service
at least ten working days before the hearing. The scope of the hearing shall be limited solely to
the issue of whether the temporary immediate suspension should remain in effect pending the
commissioner's final order under section 245A.08, regarding a licensing sanction issued under
subdivision 3 following the immediate suspension. The burden of proof in expedited hearings
under this subdivision shall be limited to the commissioner's demonstration that reasonable cause
exists to believe that the license holder's actions or failure to comply with applicable law or rule
poses, or if the actions of other individuals or conditions in the program poses an imminent risk of
harm to the health, safety, or rights of persons served by the program.
    (b) The administrative law judge shall issue findings of fact, conclusions, and a recommendation
within ten working days from the date of hearing. The parties shall have ten calendar days to
submit exceptions to the administrative law judge's report. The record shall close at the end of the
ten-day period for submission of exceptions. The commissioner's final order shall be issued within
ten working days from the close of the record. Within 90 calendar days after a final order affirming
an immediate suspension, the commissioner shall make a determination regarding whether a final
licensing sanction shall be issued under subdivision 3. The license holder shall continue to be
prohibited from operation of the program during this 90-day period.
    (c) When the final order under paragraph (b) affirms an immediate suspension, and a final
licensing sanction is issued under subdivision 3 and the license holder appeals that sanction,
the license holder continues to be prohibited from operation of the program pending a final
commissioner's order under section 245A.08, subdivision 5, regarding the final licensing sanction.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. License suspension, revocation, or fine. (a) The commissioner may suspend or revoke
a license, or impose a fine if a license holder fails to comply fully with applicable laws or rules, if a
license holder or, a controlling individual, an individual living in the household where the licensed
services are provided or is otherwise subject to a background study has a disqualification which
has not been set aside under section 245C.22, or if a license holder knowingly withholds relevant
information from or gives false or misleading information to the commissioner in connection with
an application for a license, in connection with the background study status of an individual, o       ­­
                                                                                                        r
during an investigation, or regarding compliance with applicable laws or rules. A license holder
who has had a license suspended, revoked, or has been ordered to pay a fine must be given notice of
the action by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the notice must be mailed to the address
5418                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [71ST DAY

shown on the application or the last known address of the license holder. The notice must state the
reasons the license was suspended, revoked, or a fine was ordered.
    (b) If the license was suspended or revoked, the notice must inform the license holder of the right
to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612.
The license holder may appeal an order suspending or revoking a license. The appeal of an order
suspending or revoking a license must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If
mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder receives notice that the license has been suspended or revoked. If a request is
made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within ten calendar days after
the license holder received the order. Except as provided in subdivision 2a, paragraph (c), a timely
appeal of an order suspending or revoking a license shall stay the suspension or revocation until the
commissioner issues a final order.
    (c)(1) If the license holder was ordered to pay a fine, the notice must inform the license holder of
the responsibility for payment of fines and the right to a contested case hearing under chapter 14 and
Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The appeal of an order to pay a fine must be made
in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the appeal must be postmarked and sent
to the commissioner within ten calendar days after the license holder receives notice that the fine
has been ordered. If a request is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner
within ten calendar days after the license holder received the order.
    (2) The license holder shall pay the fines assessed on or before the payment date specified. If
the license holder fails to fully comply with the order, the commissioner may issue a second fine
or suspend the license until the license holder complies. If the license holder receives state funds,
the state, county, or municipal agencies or departments responsible for administering the funds shall
withhold payments and recover any payments made while the license is suspended for failure to pay
a fine. A timely appeal shall stay payment of the fine until the commissioner issues a final order.
    (3) A license holder shall promptly notify the commissioner of human services, in writing, when
a violation specified in the order to forfeit a fine is corrected. If upon reinspection the commissioner
determines that a violation has not been corrected as indicated by the order to forfeit a fine, the
commissioner may issue a second fine. The commissioner shall notify the license holder by certified
mail or personal service that a second fine has been assessed. The license holder may appeal the
second fine as provided under this subdivision.
    (4) Fines shall be assessed as follows: the license holder shall forfeit $1,000 for each
determination of maltreatment of a child under section 626.556 or the maltreatment of a vulnerable
adult under section 626.557; the license holder shall forfeit $200 for each occurrence of a violation
of law or rule governing matters of health, safety, or supervision, including but not limited to the
provision of adequate staff-to-child or adult ratios, and failure to submit a background study; and
the license holder shall forfeit $100 for each occurrence of a violation of law or rule other than
those subject to a $1,000 or $200 fine above. For purposes of this section, "occurrence" means each
violation identified in the commissioner's fine order.
    (5) When a fine has been assessed, the license holder may not avoid payment by closing, selling,
or otherwise transferring the licensed program to a third party. In such an event, the license holder
will be personally liable for payment. In the case of a corporation, each controlling individual is
personally and jointly liable for payment.

      Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.07, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 6. Appeal of multiple sanctions. (a) When the license holder appeals more than one
licensing action or sanction that were simultaneously issued by the commissioner, the license holder
shall specify the actions or sanctions that are being appealed.
   (b) If there are different timelines prescribed in statutes for the licensing actions or sanctions
being appealed, the license holder must submit the appeal within the longest of those timelines
specified in statutes.
     (c) The appeal must be made in writing by certified mail or personal service. If mailed, the
appeal must be postmarked and sent to the commissioner within the prescribed timeline with the
first day beginning the day after the license holder receives the certified letter. If a request is made
by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner within the prescribed timeline with
the first day beginning the day after the license holder receives the certified letter.
    (d) When there are different timelines prescribed in statutes for the appeal of licensing actions or
sanctions simultaneously issued by the commissioner, the commissioner shall specify in the notice
to the license holder the timeline for appeal as specified under paragraph (b).
      Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
       Subd. 2a. Consolidated contested case hearings. (a) When a denial of a license under section
245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, subdivision 3, is based on a disqualification
for which reconsideration was requested and which was not set aside under section 245C.22, the
scope of the contested case hearing shall include the disqualification and the licensing sanction or
denial of a license, unless otherwise specified in this subdivision. When the licensing sanction or
denial of a license is based on a determination of maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557,
or a disqualification for serious or recurring maltreatment which was not set aside, the scope of
the contested case hearing shall include the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and the
licensing sanction or denial of a license, unless otherwise specified in this subdivision. In such
cases, a fair hearing under section 256.045 shall not be conducted as provided for in sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. W                                                       ­h­­

determination under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d, and
reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, shall not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07,
is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder is based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
      (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of

a license or licensing sanction. In these cases, a fair hearing shall not be conducted under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. The scope of the contested case
hearing must include the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of a license or
licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
    (c) In consolidated contested case hearings regarding sanctions issued in family child care, child

chapter 245C and is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination, specifically,
including a challenge to the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.

appeal the previous maltreatment determination under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, or 626.557,
subdivision 9d, the commissioner's order is conclusive on the issue of maltreatment. In such cases,
the scope of the administrative law judge's review shall be limited to the disqualification and the
licensing sanction or denial of a license. In the case of a denial of a license or a licensing sanction
issued to a facility based on a maltreatment determination regarding an individual who is not the
license holder or a household member, the scope of the administrative law judge's review includes
the maltreatment determination.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective August 1, 2008.
    Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245A.11, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Adult foster care; variance for alternate overnight supervision. (a) The
commissioner may grant a variance under section 245A.04, subdivision 9, to rule parts requiring
a caregiver to be present in an adult foster care home during normal sleeping hours to allow for
alternative methods of overnight supervision. The commissioner may grant the variance if the
local county licensing agency recommends the variance and the county recommendation includes
documentation verifying that:
   (1) the county has approved the license holder's plan for alternative methods of providing
overnight supervision and determined the plan protects the residents' health, safety, and rights;
   (2) the license holder has obtained written and signed informed consent from each resident or
each resident's legal representative documenting the resident's or legal representative's agreement
with the alternative method of overnight supervision; and
    (3) the alternative method of providing overnight supervision, which may include the use
of technology, is specified for each resident in the resident's: (i) individualized plan of care; (ii)
individual service plan under section 256B.092, subdivision 1b, if required; or (iii) individual
resident placement agreement under Minnesota Rules, part 9555.5105, subpart 19, if required.
    (b) To be eligible for a variance under paragraph (a), the adult foster care license holder must
not have had a licensing action under section 245A.06 or 245A.07 during the prior 24 months based
on failure to provide adequate supervision, health care services, or resident safety in the adult foster
care home.
    (c) A license holder requesting a variance under this subdivision to utilize technology as a
component of a plan for alternative overnight supervision may request the commissioner's review
in the absence of a county recommendation. Upon receipt of such a request from a license holder,
the commissioner shall review the variance request with the county.

children in care.
    Based on the results of this review, the license holder must develop, document, and implement
a corrective action plan designed to correct current lapses and prevent future lapses in performance
by individuals or the license holder, if any;
    (2) identify the primary and secondary person or position who will ensure that, when required,
internal reviews are completed. The secondary person shall be involved when there is reason to

     (11) criminal records from other states.
    (b) The commissioner is not required to conduct more than one review of a subject's records from

occurs last.

misdemeanor, the individual is disqualified, but the disqualification look-back period for the
offense is the period applicable to gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor offenses.

date begins from the date of the dismissal, the date of discharge of the sentence imposed for a
conviction for a disqualifying crime of similar elements, or the date of the incident, whichever
occurs last.

   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.16, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Determining immediate risk of harm. (a) If the commissioner determines
that the individual studied has a disqualifying characteristic, the commissioner shall review the
information immediately available and make a determination as to the subject's immediate risk of
harm to persons served by the program where the individual studied will have direct contact with,
or access to, people receiving services.
    (b) The commissioner shall consider all relevant information available, including the following
factors in determining the immediate risk of harm:
   (1) the recency of the disqualifying characteristic;
   (2) the recency of discharge from probation for the crimes;
   (3) the number of disqualifying characteristics;
   (4) the intrusiveness or violence of the disqualifying characteristic;
   (5) the vulnerability of the victim involved in the disqualifying characteristic;
    (6) the similarity of the victim to the persons served by the program where the individual studied
will have direct contact; ­ an

been set aside.
              ­; and
    (8) if the individual has a disqualification which may not be set aside because it is a permanent
bar under section 245C.24, subdivision 1, the commissioner may order the immediate removal of the
individual from any position allowing direct contact with, or access to, persons receiving services
from the program.
    (c) This section does not apply when the subject of a background study is regulated by a
health-related licensing board as defined in chapter 214, and the subject is determined to be
responsible for substantiated maltreatment under section 626.556 or 626.557.
    (d) If the commissioner has reason to believe, based on arrest information or an active
maltreatment investigation, that an individual poses an imminent risk of harm to persons receiving
services, the commissioner may order that the person be continuously supervised or immediately
removed pending the conclusion of the maltreatment investigation or criminal proceedings.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.17, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Disqualification notice sent to subject. (a) If the information in the study indicates the
individual is disqualified from direct contact with, or from access to, persons served by the program,
the commissioner shall disclose to the individual studied:
   (1) the information causing disqualification;
   (2) instructions on how to request a reconsideration of the disqualification;
    (3) an explanation of any restrictions on the commissioner's discretion to set aside the
disqualification under section 245C.24, when applicable to the individual;

granted a variance under section 245C.30, the individual's identity and the reason for the individual's
disqualification will become public data under section 245C.22, subdivision 7, when applicable to
the individual; and
   (5) the commissioner's determination of the individual's immediate risk of harm under section
245C.16.
    (b) If the commissioner determines under section 245C.16 that an individual poses an imminent
risk of harm to persons served by the program where the individual will have direct contact with, or
access to, people receiving services, the commissioner's notice must include an explanation of the
basis of this determination.
    (c) If the commissioner determines under section 245C.16 that an individual studied does
not pose a risk of harm that requires immediate removal, the individual shall be informed of the

under section 245C.16, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause (3), the disqualified individual must
submit the request for reconsideration within 15 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the
notice of disqualification. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to
the commissioner within 15 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification.
If a request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the commissioner

within 15 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification.
    (c) An individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under section 626.556 or a
vulnerable adult under section 626.557, and who is disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring
maltreatment, may request a reconsideration of both the maltreatment and the disqualification
determinations. The request must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt
of the notice of disqualification. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be postmarked
and sent to the commissioner within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification. If a request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the commissioner within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (d) Except for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment
determination under sections 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d, and
reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, shall not be conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction. In such cases, a fair hearing under section 256.045 must not be
conducted under sections 245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d. Under
section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the consolidated contested case hearing must include
the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and denial of a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.

reconsideration must submit information showing that:
   (1) the information the commissioner relied upon in determining the underlying conduct that
gave rise to the disqualification is incorrect;
   (2) for maltreatment, the information the commissioner relied upon in determining that
maltreatment was serious or recurring is incorrect; or
    (3) the subject of the study does not pose a risk of harm to any person served by the applicant,
license holder, or other entities as provided in this chapter, by addressing the information required
under section 245C.22, subdivision 4.

    (b) In order to determine the individual's risk of harm, the commissioner may require additional
information from the disqualified individual as part of the reconsideration process. If the individual
fails to provide the required information, the commissioner may deny the individual's request.
   Sec. 43. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.22, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Risk of harm; set aside. (a) The commissioner may set aside the disqualification if
the commissioner finds that the individual has submitted sufficient information to demonstrate that
the individual does not pose a risk of harm to any person served by the applicant, license holder, or
other entities as provided in this chapter.
    (b) In determining whether the individual has met the burden of proof by demonstrating the
individual does not pose a risk of harm, the commissioner shall consider:
   (1) the nature, severity, and consequences of the event or events that led to the disqualification;
   (2) whether there is more than one disqualifying event;
   (3) the age and vulnerability of the victim at the time of the event;
   (4) the harm suffered by the victim;
   (5) vulnerability of persons served by the program;
   (6) the similarity between the victim and persons served by the program;
   ­
   (6
    ­­) (7) the time elapsed without a repeat of the same or similar event;
   ­
   (7
    ­­) (8) documentation of successful completion by the individual studied of training or
rehabilitation pertinent to the event; and
   ­
   (8
    ­­) (9) any other information relevant to reconsideration.
     (c) If the individual requested reconsideration on the basis that the information relied upon
to disqualify the individual was incorrect or inaccurate and the commissioner determines that the
information relied upon to disqualify the individual is correct, the commissioner must also determine
if the individual poses a risk of harm to persons receiving services in accordance with paragraph (b).
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.22, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Scope of set aside. If the commissioner sets aside a disqualification under this section,
the disqualified individual remains disqualified, but may hold a license and have direct contact with
or access to persons receiving services. The commissioner's set aside of a disqualification is limited
solely to the licensed program, applicant, or agency specified in the set aside notice under section
245C.23, unless otherwise specified in the notice. For personal care provider organizations, the
commissioner's set-aside may further be limited to a specific individual who is receiving services.
   Sec. 45. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.24, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Ten-year bar to set aside disqualification. (a) The commissioner may not set aside
the disqualification of an individual in connection with a license to provide family child care
for children, foster care for children in the provider's home, or foster care or day care services
for adults in the provider's home if: (1) less than ten years has passed since the discharge of the

conduct against a vulnerable adult); or 624.713 (certain persons not to possess firearms).
    (b) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten years
have passed since the individual's aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy to commit any of the
offenses listed in paragraph (a) as each of these offenses is defined in Minnesota Statutes.
    (c) The commissioner may not set aside the disqualification of an individual if less than ten
years have passed since the discharge of the sentence imposed for an offense in any other state or
country, the elements of which are substantially similar to the elements of any of the offenses listed
in paragraph (a).
   Sec. 46. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Fair hearing when disqualification is not set aside. (a) If the commissioner
does not set aside a disqualification of an individual under section 245C.22 who is disqualified on
the basis of a preponderance of evidence that the individual committed an act or acts that meet the
definition of any of the crimes listed in section 245C.15; for a determination under section 626.556
or 626.557 of substantiated maltreatment that was serious or recurring under section 245C.15; or
for failure to make required reports under section 626.556, subdivision 3; or 626.557, subdivision
3, pursuant to section 245C.15, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), clause (1), the individual may request
5450                                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                           [71ST DAY

a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the disqualification is deemed conclusive under section
245C.29.
    (b) The fair hearing is the only administrative appeal of the final agency determination for
purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual. The disqualified individual does not have the
right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of data under section 13.04.
    (c) Except as provided under paragraph (e), if the individual was disqualified based on a
conviction or admission to any crimes listed in section 245C.15, subdivisions 1 to 4, or for a
disqualification under section 256.98, subdivision 8, the reconsideration decision under section
245C.22 is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual
and is not subject to a hearing under section 256.045. If the individual was disqualified based on a
judicial determination, that determination is treated the same as a conviction for purposes of appeal.
    (d) This subdivision does not apply to a public employee's appeal of a disqualification under
section 245C.28, subdivision 3.
    (e) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if the commissioner does not set aside a disqualification of
an individual who was disqualified based on both a preponderance of evidence and a conviction
or admission, the individual may request a fair hearing under section 256.045, unless the
disqualifications are deemed conclusive under section 245C.29. The scope of the hearing conducted
under section 256.045 with regard to the disqualification based on a conviction or admission shall
be limited solely to whether the individual poses a risk of harm, according to section 256.045,
subdivision 3b. In this case, the reconsideration decision under section 245C.22 is not the final
agency decision for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual.
     Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 245C.28, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. License holder. (a) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification for which
reconsideration was requested and which was not set aside is the basis for a denial of a license under
section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a
contested case hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. The
license holder must submit the appeal under section 245A.05 or 245A.07, subdivision 3.

needs or safety of another child in their care;
   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,

sympathomimetic medications, consistent with section 125A.091, subdivision 5;

the child's parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and
depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report

age and stage of development, with due regard to the child's culture.
    (g) "Physical abuse" means any physical injury, mental injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a
person responsible for the child's care on a child other than by accidental means, or any physical or

   Sec. 53. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10e, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10e. Determinations. (a) The local welfare agency shall conclude the family assessment
or the investigation within 45 days of the receipt of a report. The conclusion of the assessment or
investigation may be extended to permit the completion of a criminal investigation or the receipt of
expert information requested within 45 days of the receipt of the report.
    (b) After conducting a family assessment, the local welfare agency shall determine whether
services are needed to address the safety of the child and other family members and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment.
     (c) After conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall make two determinations:
first, whether maltreatment has occurred; and second, whether child protective services are needed.
    (d) If the commissioner of education conducts an assessment or investigation, the commissioner
shall determine whether maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken
by the school facility. If a determination is made that maltreatment has occurred, the commissioner
shall report to the employer, the school board, and any appropriate licensing entity the determination
that maltreatment occurred and what corrective or protective action was taken by the school facility.
In all other cases, the commissioner shall inform the school board or employer that a report was
received, the subject of the report, the date of the initial report, the category of maltreatment alleged
as defined in paragraph (f), the fact that maltreatment was not determined, and a summary of the
specific reasons for the determination.
    (e) When maltreatment is determined in an investigation involving a facility, the investigating
agency shall also determine whether the facility or individual was responsible, or whether both the
facility and the individual were responsible for the maltreatment using the mitigating factors in
paragraph (i). Determinations under this subdivision must be made based on a preponderance of the
evidence and are private data on individuals or nonpublic data as maintained by the commissioner
of education.
   (f) For the purposes of this subdivision, "maltreatment" means any of the following acts or
omissions:
   (1) physical abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (g);
   (2) neglect as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (f);
   (3) sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (d);
   (4) mental injury as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (m); or
   (5) maltreatment of a child in a facility as defined in subdivision 2, paragraph (i).
   (g) For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination that child protective services are
needed means that the local welfare agency has documented conditions during the assessment
or investigation sufficient to cause a child protection worker, as defined in section 626.559,
subdivision 1, to conclude that a child is at significant risk of maltreatment if protective intervention

is not provided and that the individuals responsible for the child's care have not taken or are not
likely to take actions to protect the child from maltreatment or risk of maltreatment.
    (h) This subdivision does not mean that maltreatment has occurred solely because the child's
parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's care in good faith selects and depends
upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child, in lieu
of medical care. However, if lack of medical care may result in serious danger to the child's health,
the local welfare agency may ensure that necessary medical services are provided to the child.
   (i) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party, or whether
both the facility and the individual are responsible for determined maltreatment in a facility, the
investigating agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were according to, and followed
the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive; however,
this is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver was responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, individual care plan, or directive or knew or should have known of
the errors and took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements placed
upon an employee, including the facility's compliance with related regulatory standards and the
adequacy of facility policies and procedures, facility training, an individual's participation in the
training, the caregiver's supervision, and facility staffing levels and the scope of the individual
employee's authority and discretion; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
    (j) Individual counties may implement more detailed definitions or criteria that indicate which
allegations to investigate, as long as a county's policies are consistent with the definitions in
the statutes and rules and are approved by the county board. Each local welfare agency shall
periodically inform mandated reporters under subdivision 3 who work in the county of the
definitions of maltreatment in the statutes and rules and any additional definitions or criteria that
have been approved by the county board.

reconsideration is not applicable in family assessments since no determination concerning
maltreatment is made. For investigations, except as provided under paragraph (e), an individual or
facility that the commissioner of human services, a local social service agency, or the commissioner
of education determines has maltreated a child, an interested person acting on behalf of the
child, regardless of the determination, who contests the investigating agency's final determination
regarding maltreatment, may request the investigating agency to reconsider its final determination
regarding maltreatment. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the
investigating agency within 15 calendar days after receipt of notice of the final determination
regarding maltreatment or, if the request is made by an interested person who is not entitled to
notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the parent or guardian of the child. If mailed,
the request for reconsideration must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency within 15

calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. If the request for
reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received by the investigating agency within
15 calendar days after the individual's or facility's receipt of the final determination. Effective
January 1, 2002, an individual who was determined to have maltreated a child under this section and
who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must
be submitted within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice of disqualification
under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification must be postmarked and sent to the investigating agency
within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the maltreatment determination and notice of
disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be received
by the investigating agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the investigating agency denies the request
or fails to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration,
the person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045 may submit to the commissioner
of human services or the commissioner of education a written request for a hearing under that
section. Section 256.045 also governs hearings requested to contest a final determination of the
commissioner of education. For reports involving maltreatment of a child in a facility, an interested
person acting on behalf of the child may request a review by the Child Maltreatment Review Panel
under section 256.022 if the investigating agency denies the request or fails to act upon the request
or if the interested person contests a reconsidered determination. The investigating agency shall
notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under this paragraph. The request must
be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the investigating agency within 30
calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration or of a reconsidered
determination. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency determination with
which the person is dissatisfied.
    (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the investigating agency changes the final
determination of maltreatment, that agency shall notify the parties specified in subdivisions 10b,
10d, and 10f.
    (d) Except as provided under paragraph (f), if an individual or facility contests the investigating
agency's final determination regarding maltreatment by requesting a fair hearing under section
256.045, the commissioner of human services shall assure that the hearing is conducted and a
decision is reached within 90 days of receipt of the request for a hearing. The time for action on
the decision may be extended for as many days as the hearing is postponed or the record is held
open for the benefit of either party.
    (e) Effective January 1, 2002, if an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and
245C.15, on the basis of a determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and
the individual has requested reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph
(a) and requested reconsideration of the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27,
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and reconsideration of the disqualification shall
be consolidated into a single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination
is denied or the disqualification is not set aside under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, the individual

may request a fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both
the maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
     (f) Effective January 1, 2002, if a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on
serious or recurring maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or
a licensing sanction under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case
hearing under chapter 14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for
under section 245A.08, subdivision 2a, the scope of the contested case hearing shall include
the maltreatment determination, disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license.
In such cases, a fair hearing regarding the maltreatment determination and disqualification shall

section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the child" means a
parent or legal guardian; stepparent; grandparent; guardian ad litem; adult stepbrother, stepsister, or
sibling; or adult aunt or uncle; unless the person has been determined to be the perpetrator of the
maltreatment.
     Sec. 55. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.557, subdivision 9c, is amended to read:
    Subd. 9c. Lead agency; notifications, dispositions, and determinations. (a) Upon request of
the reporter, the lead agency shall notify the reporter that it has received the report, and provide
5462                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [71ST DAY

information on the initial disposition of the report within five business days of receipt of the report,
provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation.
    (b) Upon conclusion of every investigation it conducts, the lead agency shall make a final
disposition as defined in section 626.5572, subdivision 8.
   (c) When determining whether the facility or individual is the responsible party for substantiated
maltreatment or whether both the facility and the individual are responsible for substantiated
maltreatment, the lead agency shall consider at least the following mitigating factors:
    (1) whether the actions of the facility or the individual caregivers were in accordance with, and
followed the terms of, an erroneous physician order, prescription, resident care plan, or directive.
This is not a mitigating factor when the facility or caregiver is responsible for the issuance of the
erroneous order, prescription, plan, or directive or knows or should have known of the errors and
took no reasonable measures to correct the defect before administering care;
    (2) the comparative responsibility between the facility, other caregivers, and requirements
placed upon the employee, including but not limited to, the facility's compliance with related
regulatory standards and factors such as the adequacy of facility policies and procedures, the
adequacy of facility training, the adequacy of an individual's participation in the training, the
adequacy of caregiver supervision, the adequacy of facility staffing levels, and a consideration of
the scope of the individual employee's authority; and
   (3) whether the facility or individual followed professional standards in exercising professional
judgment.
    (d) The lead agency shall complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days. If the lead agency
is unable to complete its final disposition within 60 calendar days, the lead agency shall notify the
following persons provided that the notification will not endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the
investigation: (1) the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known, if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation and (2) the facility, where applicable. The
notice shall contain the reason for the delay and the projected completion date. If the lead agency is
unable to complete its final disposition by a subsequent projected completion date, the lead agency
shall again notify the vulnerable adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, when known if the
lead agency knows them to be aware of the investigation, and the facility, where applicable, of the
reason for the delay and the revised projected completion date provided that the notification will not
endanger the vulnerable adult or hamper the investigation. A lead agency's inability to complete the
final disposition within 60 calendar days or by any projected completion date does not invalidate
the final disposition.
    (e) Within ten calendar days of completing the final disposition, the lead agency shall provide a
copy of the public investigation memorandum under subdivision 12b, paragraph (b), clause (1),
when required to be completed under this section, to the following persons: (1) the vulnerable
adult, or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known unless the lead agency knows that the
notification would endanger the well-being of the vulnerable adult; (2) the reporter, if the reporter
requested notification when making the report, provided this notification would not endanger the
well-being of the vulnerable adult; (3) the alleged perpetrator, if known; (4) the facility; and (5)
the ombudsman for older Minnesotans, or the ombudsman for mental health and developmental
disabilities, as appropriate.

    (f) The lead agency shall notify the vulnerable adult who is the subject of the report or the
vulnerable adult's legal guardian, if known, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated
a vulnerable adult, of their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.021.
    (g) The lead agency shall routinely provide investigation memoranda for substantiated reports to
the appropriate licensing boards. These reports must include the names of substantiated perpetrators.
The lead agency may not provide investigative memoranda for inconclusive or false reports to
the appropriate licensing boards unless the lead agency's investigation gives reason to believe that
there may have been a violation of the applicable professional practice laws. If the investigation
memorandum is provided to a licensing board, the subject of the investigation memorandum shall
be notified and receive a summary of the investigative findings.
    (h) In order to avoid duplication, licensing boards shall consider the findings of the lead agency
in their investigations if they choose to investigate. This does not preclude licensing boards from
considering other information.
    (i) The lead agency must provide to the commissioner of human services its final dispositions,
including the names of all substantiated perpetrators. The commissioner of human services shall
establish records to retain the names of substantiated perpetrators.

provided under paragraph (e), any individual or facility which a lead agency determines has
maltreated a vulnerable adult, or the vulnerable adult or an interested person acting on behalf of the
vulnerable adult, regardless of the lead agency's determination, who contests the lead agency's final
disposition of an allegation of maltreatment, may request the lead agency to reconsider its final
disposition. The request for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the lead agency within
15 calendar days after receipt of notice of final disposition or, if the request is made by an interested
person who is not entitled to notice, within 15 days after receipt of the notice by the vulnerable
adult or the vulnerable adult's legal guardian. If mailed, the request for reconsideration must be
postmarked and sent to the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's
receipt of the final disposition. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it
must be received by the lead agency within 15 calendar days of the individual's or facility's receipt
of the final disposition. An individual who was determined to have maltreated a vulnerable adult
under this section and who was disqualified on the basis of serious or recurring maltreatment under
sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, may request reconsideration of the maltreatment determination
and the disqualification. The request for reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the
disqualification must be submitted in writing within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt
of the notice of disqualification under sections 245C.16 and 245C.17. If mailed, the request for
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination and the disqualification must be postmarked
and sent to the lead agency within 30 calendar days of the individual's receipt of the notice
of disqualification. If the request for reconsideration is made by personal service, it must be
received by the lead agency within 30 calendar days after the individual's receipt of the notice of
disqualification.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f), if the lead agency denies the request or fails
to act upon the request within 15 working days after receiving the request for reconsideration, the

person or facility entitled to a fair hearing under section 256.045, may submit to the commissioner
of human services a written request for a hearing under that statute. The vulnerable adult, or an
interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult, may request a review by the Vulnerable
Adult Maltreatment Review Panel under section 256.021 if the lead agency denies the request or
fails to act upon the request, or if the vulnerable adult or interested person contests a reconsidered
disposition. The lead agency shall notify persons who request reconsideration of their rights under
this paragraph. The request must be submitted in writing to the review panel and a copy sent to the
lead agency within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice of a denial of a request for reconsideration
or of a reconsidered disposition. The request must specifically identify the aspects of the agency
determination with which the person is dissatisfied.
   (c) If, as a result of a reconsideration or review, the lead agency changes the final disposition, it
shall notify the parties specified in subdivision 9c, paragraph (d).
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "interested person acting on behalf of the vulnerable adult"
means a person designated in writing by the vulnerable adult to act on behalf of the vulnerable
adult, or a legal guardian or conservator or other legal representative, a proxy or health care agent
appointed under chapter 145B or 145C, or an individual who is related to the vulnerable adult, as
defined in section 245A.02, subdivision 13.
    (e) If an individual was disqualified under sections 245C.14 and 245C.15, on the basis of a
determination of maltreatment, which was serious or recurring, and the individual has requested
reconsideration of the maltreatment determination under paragraph (a) and reconsideration of
the disqualification under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, reconsideration of the maltreatment
determination and requested reconsideration of the disqualification shall be consolidated into a
single reconsideration. If reconsideration of the maltreatment determination is denied or if the
disqualification is not set aside under sections 245C.21 to 245C.27, the individual may request a
fair hearing under section 256.045. If an individual requests a fair hearing on the maltreatment
determination and the disqualification, the scope of the fair hearing shall include both the
maltreatment determination and the disqualification.
     (f) If a maltreatment determination or a disqualification based on serious or recurring
maltreatment is the basis for a denial of a license under section 245A.05 or a licensing sanction
under section 245A.07, the license holder has the right to a contested case hearing under chapter
14 and Minnesota Rules, parts 1400.8505 to 1400.8612. As provided for under section 245A.08,
the scope of the contested case hearing ­                            sh­­
                                                                        a­l

disqualification, and licensing sanction or denial of a license. In such cases, a fair hearing ­                                                    sh

for family child care and child foster care, reconsideration of a maltreatment determination under
this subdivision, and reconsideration of a disqualification under section 245C.22, must not be
conducted when:
    (1) a denial of a license under section 245A.05, or a licensing sanction under section
245A.07, is based on a determination that the license holder is responsible for maltreatment or the
disqualification of a license holder based on serious or recurring maltreatment;
71ST DAY]                           THURSDAY, MAY 17, 2007                                         5465

    (2) the denial of a license or licensing sanction is issued at the same time as the maltreatment
determination or disqualification; and
    (3) the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination or disqualification, and denial of
a license or licensing sanction.
    Notwithstanding clauses (1) to (3), if the license holder appeals the maltreatment determination
or disqualification, but does not appeal the denial of a license or a licensing sanction, reconsideration
of the maltreatment determination shall be conducted under section 626.556, subdivision 10i, and
section 626.557, subdivision 9d, and reconsideration of the disqualification shall be conducted under
section 245C.22. In such cases, a fair hearing shall also be conducted as provided under sections
245C.27, 626.556, subdivision 10i, and 626.557, subdivision 9d.
   If the disqualified subject is an individual other than the license holder and upon whom a
background study must be conducted under chapter 245C, the hearings of all parties may be
consolidated into a single contested case hearing upon consent of all parties and the administrative
law judge.
    (g) Until August 1, 2002, an individual or facility that was determined by the commissioner of
human services or the commissioner of health to be responsible for neglect under section 626.5572,
subdivision 17, after October 1, 1995, and before August 1, 2001, that believes that the finding
of neglect does not meet an amended definition of neglect may request a reconsideration of the
determination of neglect. The commissioner of human services or the commissioner of health shall
mail a notice to the last known address of individuals who are eligible to seek this reconsideration.
The request for reconsideration must state how the established findings no longer meet the elements
of the definition of neglect. The commissioner shall review the request for reconsideration and make
a determination within 15 calendar days. The commissioner's decision on this reconsideration is the
final agency action.
   (1) For purposes of compliance with the data destruction schedule under subdivision 12b,
paragraph (d), when a finding of substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a
reconsideration under this paragraph, the date of the original finding of a substantiated maltreatment
must be used to calculate the destruction date.
    (2) For purposes of any background studies under chapter 245C, when a determination of
substantiated maltreatment has been changed as a result of a reconsideration under this paragraph,
any prior disqualification of the individual under chapter 245C that was based on this determination
of maltreatment shall be rescinded, and for future background studies under chapter 245C the
commissioner must not use the previous determination of substantiated maltreatment as a basis for
disqualification or as a basis for referring the individual's maltreatment history to a health-related
licensing board under section 245C.31.
   Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.5572, subdivision 17, is amended to read:
   Subd. 17. Neglect. "Neglect" means:
    (a) The failure or omission by a caregiver to supply a vulnerable adult with care or services,
including but not limited to, food, clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision which is:
   (1) reasonable and necessary to obtain or maintain the vulnerable adult's physical or mental
health or safety, considering the physical and mental capacity or dysfunction of the vulnerable adult;

and
      (2) which is not the result of an accident or therapeutic conduct.
    (b) The absence or likelihood of absence of care or services, including but not limited to, food,
clothing, shelter, health care, or supervision necessary to maintain the physical and mental health
of the vulnerable adult which a reasonable person would deem essential to obtain or maintain
the vulnerable adult's health, safety, or comfort considering the physical or mental capacity or
dysfunction of the vulnerable adult.
      (c) For purposes of this section, a vulnerable adult is not neglected for the sole reason that:
    (1) the vulnerable adult or a person with authority to make health care decisions for the
vulnerable adult under sections 144.651, 144A.44, chapter 145B, 145C, or 252A, or sections
253B.03 or 524.5-101 to 524.5-502, refuses consent or withdraws consent, consistent with that
authority and within the boundary of reasonable medical practice, to any therapeutic conduct,
including any care, service, or procedure to diagnose, maintain, or treat the physical or mental
condition of the vulnerable adult, or, where permitted under law, to provide nutrition and hydration
parenterally or through intubation; this paragraph does not enlarge or diminish rights otherwise
held under law by:
   (i) a vulnerable adult or a person acting on behalf of a vulnerable adult, including an involved
family member, to consent to or refuse consent for therapeutic conduct; or
      (ii) a caregiver to offer or provide or refuse to offer or provide therapeutic conduct; or
    (2) the vulnerable adult, a person with authority to make health care decisions for the vulnerable
adult, or a caregiver in good faith selects and depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment
or care of disease or remedial care of the vulnerable adult in lieu of medical care, provided that this
is consistent with the prior practice or belief of the vulnerable adult or with the expressed intentions
of the vulnerable adult;
   (3) the vulnerable adult, who is not impaired in judgment or capacity by mental or emotional
dysfunction or undue influence, engages in consensual sexual contact with:
    (i) a person including a facility staff person when a consensual sexual personal relationship
existed prior to the caregiving relationship; or
    (ii) a personal care attendant, regardless of whether the consensual sexual personal relationship
existed prior to the caregiving relationship; or
   (4) an individual makes an error in the provision of therapeutic conduct to a vulnerable adult
which does not result in injury or harm which reasonably requires medical or mental health care; or
    (5) an individual makes an error in the provision of therapeutic conduct to a vulnerable adult
that results in injury or harm, which reasonably requires the care of a physician, and:
   (i) the necessary care is provided in a timely fashion as dictated by the condition of the vulnerable
adult;
    (ii) if after receiving care, the health status of the vulnerable adult can be reasonably expected, as
determined by the attending physician, to be restored to the vulnerable adult's preexisting condition;

   (iii) the error is not part of a pattern of errors by the individual;
   (iv) if in a facility, the error is immediately reported as required under section 626.557, and
recorded internally in the facility;
   (v) if in a facility, the facility identifies and takes corrective action and implements measures
designed to reduce the risk of further occurrence of this error and similar errors; and
    (vi) if in a facility, the actions required under items (iv) and (v) are sufficiently documented for
review and evaluation by the facility and any applicable licensing, certification, and ombudsman
agency.
   (d) Nothing in this definition requires a caregiver, if regulated, to provide services in excess of
those required by the caregiver's license, certification, registration, or other regulation.
    (e) If the findings of an investigation by a lead agency result in a determination of substantiated
maltreatment for the sole reason that the actions required of a facility under paragraph (c), clause (5),
item (iv), (v), or (vi), were not taken, then the facility is subject to a correction order. An individual
will not be found to have neglected or maltreated the vulnerable adult based solely on the facility's
not having taken the actions required under paragraph (c), clause (5), item (iv), (v), or (vi). This must
not alter the lead agency's determination of mitigating factors under section 626.557, subdivision
9c, paragraph (c).
   Sec. 58. BACKGROUND STUDY REVIEW.
    (a) The Collateral Consequences Committee described in Laws 2006, chapter 260, article
1, section 45, or successor entity, shall review the background study provisions contained in
Minnesota Statutes, chapter 245C, as well as set-aside and variance policies. The committee shall
recommend changes in these laws to recodify and simplify them, and recommend appropriate
substantive changes to them consistent with good public policy and public safety.
    (b) By February 1, 2008, the committee shall report its findings and recommendations to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees having
jurisdiction over human services and criminal justice policy.
   Sec. 59. REPEALER.
   (a) Minnesota Statutes 2006, sections 245A.023; 245A.14, subdivisions 7, 9, 9a, 12, and 13; and
245C.06, are repealed.
