   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62A.65, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Premium rate restrictions. No individual health plan may be offered, sold, issued, or
renewed to a Minnesota resident unless the premium rate charged is determined in accordance with
the following requirements:
    (a) Premium rates must be no more than 25 percent above and no more than 25 percent below
the index rate charged to individuals for the same or similar coverage, adjusted pro rata for rating
periods of less than one year. The premium variations permitted by this paragraph must be based only
upon health status, claims experience, and occupation. For purposes of this paragraph, health status
includes refraining from tobacco use or other actuarially valid lifestyle factors associated with good
health, provided that the lifestyle factor and its effect upon premium rates have been determined by
the commissioner to be actuarially valid and have been approved by the commissioner. Variations
permitted under this paragraph must not be based upon age or applied differently at different ages.
This paragraph does not prohibit use of a constant percentage adjustment for factors permitted to
be used under this paragraph.
    (b) Premium rates may vary based upon the ages of covered persons only as provided in this
paragraph. In addition to the variation permitted under paragraph (a), each health carrier may use
an additional premium variation based upon age of up to plus or minus 50 percent of the index rate.
   (c) A health carrier may request approval by the commissioner to establish separate geographic

regions determined by the health carrier and to establish separate index rates for each such region.
The commissioner shall grant approval if the following conditions are met:
    (1) the geographic regions must be applied uniformly by the health carrier;
   (2) each geographic region must be composed of no fewer than seven counties that create a
contiguous region; and
    (3) the health carrier provides actuarial justification acceptable to the commissioner for the
proposed geographic variations in index rates, establishing that the variations are based upon
differences in the cost to the health carrier of providing coverage.
    (d) Health carriers may use rate cells and must file with the commissioner the rate cells they use.
Rate cells must be based upon the number of adults or children covered under the policy and may
reflect the availability of Medicare coverage. The rates for different rate cells must not in any way
reflect generalized differences in expected costs between principal insureds and their spouses.
   (e) In developing its index rates and premiums for a health plan, a health carrier shall take into
account only the following factors:
    (1) actuarially valid differences in rating factors permitted under paragraphs (a) and (b); and
   (2) actuarially valid geographic variations if approved by the commissioner as provided in
paragraph (c).
   (f) All premium variations must be justified in initial rate filings and upon request of
the commissioner in rate revision filings. All rate variations are subject to approval by the
commissioner.
   (g) The loss ratio must comply with the section 62A.021 requirements for individual health
plans.
    (h) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (g), the rates must not be approved, unless the
commissioner has determined that the rates are reasonable. In determining reasonableness,
the commissioner shall ­   co

rating practices guarantee must be in writing and must guarantee that the policy form will be
offered, sold, issued, and renewed only with premium rates and premium rating practices that
comply with subdivisions 2, 3, 4, and 5. The rating practices guarantee must be accompanied by an
actuarial memorandum that demonstrates that the premium rates and premium rating system used
in connection with the policy form will satisfy the guarantee. The guarantee must guarantee refunds
of any excess premiums to policyholders charged premiums that exceed those permitted under
subdivision 2, 3, 4, or 5. An insurer that complies with this paragraph in connection with a policy
form is exempt from the requirement of prior approval by the commissioner under paragraphs (c),
(f), and (h).

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2008.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.04, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Premium growth limits. (a) For calendar year 2008 and each year thereafter, the
commissioner shall set annual premium growth limits for health plan companies. The premium
limits set by the commissioner for calendar years 2008 to 2013 shall not exceed the regional
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers for the preceding calendar year plus two percentage
points and an additional one percentage point to be used to finance the implementation of the
electronic medical record system described under section 62J.495. The commissioner shall ensure
that the additional percentage point is being used to provide financial assistance to health care
providers to implement electronic medical record systems either directly or through an increase in
reimbursement.
    (b) For the calendar years beyond 2013, the rate of premium growth shall be limited to the
change in the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers for the previous calendar year plus two
percentage points. The commissioners of health and commerce shall make a recommendation to
the legislature by January 15, 2012, regarding the continuation of the additional percentage point
to the growth limit described in paragraph (a). The recommendation shall be based on the progress
made by health care providers in instituting an electronic medical record system and in creating a
statewide interactive electronic health record system.
    (c) The commissioner may add additional percentage points as needed to the premium limit for
a calendar year if a major disaster, bioterrorism, or a public health emergency occurs that results
in higher health care costs. Any additional percentage points must reflect the additional cost to the
health care system directly attributed to the disaster or emergency.
   (d) The commissioner shall publish the annual premium growth limits in the State Register by
January 31 of the year that the limits are to be in effect.
    (e) For the purposes of this subdivision, premium growth is measured as the percentage change
in per member, per month premium revenue from the current year to the previous year. Premium
growth rates shall be calculated for the following lines of business: individual, small group, and
large group. Data used for premium growth rate calculations shall be submitted as part of the cost
containment filing under section 62J.38.
   (f) For purposes of this subdivision, "health plan company" has the meaning given in section
62J.041.
   (g) A health plan company may reduce reimbursement to providers in order to meet the premium
growth limitations required by this section.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 62J.04, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Cost containment duties. The commissioner shall:

   (1) establish statewide and regional cost containment goals for total health care spending
under this section and collect data as described in sections 62J.38 to 62J.41 to monitor statewide
achievement of the cost containment goals and premium growth limits;
    (2) divide the state into no fewer than four regions, with one of those regions being the
Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan statistical area but excluding Chisago, Isanti, Wright, and
Sherburne Counties, for purposes of fostering the development of regional health planning and
coordination of health care delivery among regional health care systems and working to achieve
the cost containment goals;
   (3) monitor the quality of health care throughout the state and take action as necessary to ensure
an appropriate level of quality;
    (4) issue recommendations regarding uniform billing forms, uniform electronic billing
procedures and data interchanges, patient identification cards, and other uniform claims and
administrative procedures for health care providers and private and public sector payers. In
developing the recommendations, the commissioner shall review the work of the work group on
electronic data interchange (WEDI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) at the
national level, and the work being done at the state and local level. The commissioner may adopt
rules requiring the use of the Uniform Bill 82/92 form, the National Council of Prescription Drug
Providers (NCPDP) 3.2 electronic version, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 1500
form, or other standardized forms or procedures;
   (5) undertake health planning responsibilities;
    (6) authorize, fund, or promote research and experimentation on new technologies and health
care procedures;
    (7) within the limits of appropriations for these purposes, administer or contract for statewide
consumer education and wellness programs that will improve the health of Minnesotans and
increase individual responsibility relating to personal health and the delivery of health care
services, undertake prevention programs including initiatives to improve birth outcomes, expand
childhood immunization efforts, and provide start-up grants for worksite wellness programs;
   (8) undertake other activities to monitor and oversee the delivery of health care services in
Minnesota with the goal of improving affordability, quality, and accessibility of health care for all
Minnesotans; and
   (9) make the cost containment goal and premium growth limit data available to the public in a
consumer-oriented manner.

determines to be necessary to implement this section. The information must be submitted in
the form specified by the commissioner. The information must include, but is not limited to,
health care expenditures per member per month or cost per employee per month, and detailed
information on revenues and reserves. The commissioner, to the extent possible, shall coordinate
the submittal of the information required under this section with the submittal of the financial
data required under chapter 62J, to minimize the administrative burden on health plan companies.
The commissioner may adjust final expenditure figures for demographic changes, risk selection,
changes in basic benefits, and legislative initiatives that materially change health care costs, as long
as these adjustments are consistent with the methodology submitted by the health plan company to
the commissioner, and approved by the commissioner as actuarially justified. T                                                                  ­­ h­e­­m ­­   t ­o

    Subd. 4. Monitoring of reserves. (a) The commissioners of health and commerce shall monitor
health plan company reserves and net worth as established under chapters 60A, 62C, 62D, 62H,
and 64B, with respect to the health plan companies that each commissioner respectively regulates
to assess the degree to which savings resulting from the establishment of cost containment goals are
passed on to consumers in the form of lower premium rates.
    (b) Health plan companies shall fully reflect in the premium rates the savings generated by
the cost containment goals. No premium rate, currently reviewed by the Department of Health
or Commerce, may be approved for those health plan companies unless the health plan company
establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner of commerce or the commissioner of health, as
appropriate, that the proposed new rate would comply with this paragraph.
    (c) Health plan companies, except those licensed under chapter 60A to sell accident and sickness
insurance under chapter 62A, shall annually before the end of the fourth fiscal quarter provide to the
commissioner of health or commerce, as applicable, a projection of the level of reserves the company
expects to attain during each quarter of the following fiscal year. These health plan companies
shall submit with required quarterly financial statements a calculation of the actual reserve level
attained by the company at the end of each quarter including identification of the sources of any
significant changes in the reserve level and an updated projection of the level of reserves the health
plan company expects to attain by the end of the fiscal year. In cases where the health plan company
has been given a certificate to operate a new health maintenance organization under chapter 62D, or
been licensed as a community integrated service network under chapter 62N, or formed an affiliation
with one of these organizations, the health plan company shall also submit with its quarterly financial
statement, total enrollment at the beginning and end of the quarter and enrollment changes within
each service area of the new organization. The reserve calculations shall be maintained by the
commissioners as trade secret information, except to the extent that such information is also required
to be filed by another provision of state law and is not treated as trade secret information under such
other provisions.
    (d) Health plan companies in paragraph (c) whose reserves are less than the required minimum
or more than the required maximum at the end of the fiscal year shall submit a plan of corrective
action to the commissioner of health or commerce under subdivision 7.
    (e) The commissioner of commerce, in consultation with the commissioner of health, shall
report to the legislature no later than January 15, 1995, as to whether the concept of a reserve
corridor or other mechanism for purposes of monitoring reserves is adaptable for use with
indemnity health insurers that do business in multiple states and that must comply with their
domiciliary state's reserves requirements.
    Subd. 5. Notice. The commissioner of health shall publish in the State Register and make
available to the public by July 1, ­                19­9­5 ­ 2009, and each year thereafter, a list of all health plan
companies that exceeded their ­               co­­s­

market, and large group market. Filings under this section for calendar year 2008 must also include
information broken down by individual market, small group market, and large group market
for calendar year 2007. Expenditure data must distinguish between costs incurred for patient
care and administrative costs. Patient care and administrative costs must include only expenses
incurred on behalf of health plan members and must not include the cost of providing health care
services for nonmembers at facilities owned by the group purchaser or affiliate. Expenditure data
must be provided separately for the following categories and for other categories required by the
commissioner: physician services, dental services, other professional services, inpatient hospital
services, outpatient hospital services, emergency, pharmacy services and other nondurable medical

and administrative costs. Administrative costs must include costs for marketing; advertising;
overhead; salaries and benefits of central office staff who do not provide direct patient care;
underwriting; lobbying; claims processing; provider contracting and credentialing; detection and
prevention of payment for fraudulent or unjustified requests for reimbursement or services; clinical
quality assurance and other types of medical care quality improvement efforts; concurrent or

clinic, or health care facility, or the assets thereof; capital costs incurred on behalf of a hospital
or clinic; lease payments; or any other costs incurred pursuant to a partnership, joint venture,
integration, or affiliation agreement with a hospital, clinic, or other health care provider. Capital
costs and costs incurred must be recorded according to standard accounting principles. The reports
of this data must also separately identify expenses for local, state, and federal taxes, fees, and
assessments. The commissioner may require each group purchaser to submit any other data,
including data in unaggregated form, for the purposes of developing spending estimates, setting
spending limits, and monitoring actual spending and costs. In addition to reporting administrative
costs incurred to acquire a hospital, clinic, or health care facility, or the assets thereof; or any other
costs incurred pursuant to a partnership, joint venture, integration, or affiliation agreement with a
hospital, clinic, or other health care provider; reports submitted under this section also must include
the payments made during the calendar year for these purposes. The commissioner shall make
public, by group purchaser data collected under this paragraph in accordance with section 62J.321,
subdivision 5. Workers' compensation insurance plans and automobile insurance plans are exempt
from complying with this paragraph as it relates to the submission of administrative costs.

a program that diverts patients presenting at an emergency room for nonemergency care to more
appropriate outpatient settings. The program must refer the patient to an appropriate health care
professional based on the patient's health care needs and situation. The program must provide

       Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.0625, subdivision 30, is amended to read:
    Subd. 30. Other clinic services. (a) Medical assistance covers rural health clinic services,
federally qualified health center services, nonprofit community health clinic services, public
health clinic services, and the services of a clinic meeting the criteria established in rule by the
commissioner. Rural health clinic services and federally qualified health center services mean
services defined in United States Code, title 42, section 1396d(a)(2)(B) and (C). Payment for rural
health clinic and federally qualified health center services shall be made according to applicable
federal law and regulation.
    (b) A federally qualified health center that is beginning initial operation shall submit an estimate
of budgeted costs and visits for the initial reporting period in the form and detail required by the
commissioner. A federally qualified health center that is already in operation shall submit an initial
report using actual costs and visits for the initial reporting period. Within 90 days of the end of its
reporting period, a federally qualified health center shall submit, in the form and detail required
by the commissioner, a report of its operations, including allowable costs actually incurred for the
period and the actual number of visits for services furnished during the period, and other information
required by the commissioner. Federally qualified health centers that file Medicare cost reports
shall provide the commissioner with a copy of the most recent Medicare cost report filed with the
Medicare program intermediary for the reporting year which support the costs claimed on their cost
report to the state.

   (4) recipients receiving hospice care.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings
given.
    (a) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of human services. For the remainder of this
section, the commissioner's responsibilities for methods and policies for implementing the project
will be proposed by the project advisory committees and approved by the commissioner.
    (b) "Demonstration provider" means a health maintenance organization, community integrated
service network, or accountable provider network authorized and operating under chapter 62D, 62N,
or 62T that participates in the demonstration project according to criteria, standards, methods, and
other requirements established for the project and approved by the commissioner. For purposes of
this section, a county board, or group of county boards operating under a joint powers agreement, is
considered a demonstration provider if the county or group of county boards meets the requirements

256B.06, an individual who becomes ineligible for the program because of failure to submit income
reports or recertification forms in a timely manner, shall remain enrolled in the prepaid health plan
and shall remain eligible to receive medical assistance coverage through the last day of the month
following the month in which the enrollee became ineligible for the medical assistance program.
    (d) "Limitation of choice" means suspending freedom of choice while allowing eligible
individuals to choose among the demonstration providers.
   Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.76, is amended to read:

coding system codes titled "office and other outpatient services," "preventive medicine new and
established patient," "delivery, antepartum, and postpartum care," "critical care," cesarean delivery
and pharmacologic management provided to psychiatric patients, and level three codes for enhanced
services for prenatal high risk, shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 25 percent
above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992. If the rate on any procedure code within these categories
is different than the rate that would have been paid under the methodology in section 256B.74,
subdivision 2, then the larger rate shall be paid;
   (2) payments for all other services shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 15.4
percent above the rate in effect on June 30, 1992;
    (3) all physician rates shall be converted from the 50th percentile of 1982 to the 50th percentile
of 1989, less the percent in aggregate necessary to equal the above increases except that payment
rates for home health agency services shall be the rates in effect on September 30, 1992;
   (4) effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000, payment rates for physician and
professional services shall be increased by three percent over the rates in effect on December 31,

   (5) the increases in clause (4) shall be implemented January 1, 2000, for managed care.
   (b) Effective for services rendered on or after October 1, 1992, the commissioner shall make
payments for dental services as follows:
    (1) dental services shall be paid at the lower of (i) submitted charges, or (ii) 25 percent above
the rate in effect on June 30, 1992;
   (2) dental rates shall be converted from the 50th percentile of 1982 to the 50th percentile of
1989, less the percent in aggregate necessary to equal the above increases;
   (3) effective for services rendered on or after January 1, 2000, payment rates for dental services
shall be increased by three percent over the rates in effect on December 31, 1999;
    (4) the commissioner shall award grants to community clinics or other nonprofit community
organizations, political subdivisions, professional associations, or other organizations that
demonstrate the ability to provide dental services effectively to public program recipients. Grants
may be used to fund the costs related to coordinating access for recipients, developing and
implementing patient care criteria, upgrading or establishing new facilities, acquiring furnishings
or equipment, recruiting new providers, or other development costs that will improve access to
dental care in a region. In awarding grants, the commissioner shall give priority to applicants that
plan to serve areas of the state in which the number of dental providers is not currently sufficient to
meet the needs of recipients of public programs or uninsured individuals. The commissioner shall
consider the following in awarding the grants:
   (i) potential to successfully increase access to an underserved population;
   (ii) the ability to raise matching funds;
   (iii) the long-term viability of the project to improve access beyond the period of initial funding;
   (iv) the efficiency in the use of the funding; and

dental clinics deemed by the commissioner to be critical access dental providers. Reimbursement
to a critical access dental provider may be increased by not more than 50 percent above the
reimbursement rate that would otherwise be paid to the provider. Payments to health plan
companies shall be adjusted to reflect increased reimbursements to critical access dental providers
as approved by the commissioner. In determining which dentists and dental clinics shall be deemed
critical access dental providers, the commissioner shall review:
   (1) the utilization rate in the service area in which the dentist or dental clinic operates for
dental services to patients covered by medical assistance, general assistance medical care, or
MinnesotaCare as their primary source of coverage;
    (2) the level of services provided by the dentist or dental clinic to patients covered by medical
assistance, general assistance medical care, or MinnesotaCare as their primary source of coverage;
and
   (3) whether the level of services provided by the dentist or dental clinic is critical to maintaining
adequate levels of patient access within the service area.
In the absence of a critical access dental provider in a service area, the commissioner may designate
a dentist or dental clinic as a critical access dental provider if the dentist or dental clinic is willing
to provide care to patients covered by medical assistance, general assistance medical care, or
MinnesotaCare at a level which significantly increases access to dental care in the service area.
    The commissioner shall annually establish a reimbursement schedule for critical access dental

providers and provider-specific limits on total reimbursement received under the reimbursement
schedule, and shall notify each critical access dental provider of the schedule and limit.
    (d) The commissioner shall award special hardship grants to nonprofit dental providers with
a high proportion of uninsured patients that equals or exceeds 15 percent of the total number of
patients served by that provider and the provider does not receive a financial benefit comparable
to other critical access dental providers under the critical access dental provider formula described
in paragraph (c). The commissioner shall award a grant to these providers allocated in proportion
to each critical access dental provider's ratio of uninsured patients to the total number of patients
served by all providers who qualify for a grant under this paragraph.
    (e) An entity that operates both a Medicare certified comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation
facility and a facility which was certified prior to January 1, 1993, that is licensed under Minnesota
Rules, parts 9570.2000 to 9570.3600, and for whom at least 33 percent of the clients receiving
rehabilitation services in the most recent calendar year are medical assistance recipients, shall be
reimbursed by the commissioner for rehabilitation services at rates that are 38 percent greater than
the maximum reimbursement rate allowed under paragraph (a), clause (2), when those services are
(1) provided within the comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility and (2) provided to residents
of nursing facilities owned by the entity.

make payments for physician and professional services based on the Medicare relative value
units (RVU's). This change shall be budget neutral and the cost of implementing RVU's will be
incorporated in the established conversion factor.
   Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256D.03, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. General assistance medical care; eligibility. (a) General assistance medical care may

on the person's behalf under sections 256I.01 to 256I.06; or
   (2) who is a resident of Minnesota; and
    (i) who has gross countable income not in excess of 75 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
for the family size, using a six-month budget period and whose equity in assets is not in excess
of $1,000 per assistance unit. General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or
enrollees who are otherwise eligible for medical assistance but fail to verify their assets. Enrollees

Exempt assets, the reduction of excess assets, and the waiver of excess assets must conform to the
medical assistance program in section 256B.056, subdivision 3, with the following exception: the

in excess of 175 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the family size, using a six-month
budget period, whose equity in assets is not in excess of the limits in section 256B.056, subdivision

    (iii) the commissioner shall adjust the income standards under this section each July 1 by
the annual update of the federal poverty guidelines following publication by the United States
Department of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Effective for applications and renewals processed on or after September 1, 2006, general

Insurance by the Social Security Administration; who fail to meet the requirements of section
256L.09, subdivision 2; who are homeless as defined by United States Code, title 42, section

exempt from the MinnesotaCare enrollment requirements of this subdivision.
    (f) For applications received on or after October 1, 2003, eligibility may begin no earlier
than the date of application. For individuals eligible under paragraph (a), clause (2), item (i),
a redetermination of eligibility must occur every 12 months. Individuals are eligible under
paragraph (a), clause (2), item (ii), only during inpatient hospitalization but may reapply if there is
a subsequent period of inpatient hospitalization.
    (g) Beginning September 1, 2006, Minnesota health care program applications and renewals
completed by recipients and applicants who are persons described in paragraph (c) and submitted
to the county agency shall be determined for MinnesotaCare eligibility by the county agency.
If all other eligibility requirements of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance
medical care shall be available in any month during which MinnesotaCare enrollment is pending.
Upon notification of eligibility for MinnesotaCare, notice of termination for eligibility for general
assistance medical care shall be sent to an applicant or recipient. If all other eligibility requirements
of this subdivision are met, eligibility for general assistance medical care shall be available until
enrollment in MinnesotaCare subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (f).
17TH DAY]                      THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2007                                         327

    (h) The date of an initial Minnesota health care program application necessary to begin a
determination of eligibility shall be the date the applicant has provided a name, address, and Social
Security number, signed and dated, to the county agency or the Department of Human Services. If
the applicant is unable to provide a name, address, Social Security number, and signature when
health care is delivered due to a medical condition or disability, a health care provider may act on
an applicant's behalf to establish the date of an initial Minnesota health care program application
by providing the county agency or Department of Human Services with provider identification and
a temporary unique identifier for the applicant. The applicant must complete the remainder of the
application and provide necessary verification before eligibility can be determined. The county
agency must assist the applicant in obtaining verification if necessary.
    (i) County agencies are authorized to use all automated databases containing information
regarding recipients' or applicants' income in order to determine eligibility for general assistance
medical care or MinnesotaCare. Such use shall be considered sufficient in order to determine
eligibility and premium payments by the county agency.
    (j) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless
the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility
as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal
hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is
detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet
other eligibility requirements of this subdivision.
   (k) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not
cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance.
     (l) In determining the amount of assets of an individual eligible under paragraph (a), clause
(2), item (i), there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded
under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value
within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the
period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for
the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual
furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at
the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For
any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall
be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person
payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous
calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period
of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the
date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has
expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county
agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the
transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the
first approved application.
    (m) When determining eligibility for any state benefits under this subdivision, the income and
resources of all noncitizens shall be deemed to include their sponsor's income and resources as
defined in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, title IV,
328                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [17TH DAY

Public Law 104-193, sections 421 and 422, and subsequently set out in federal rules.
     (n) Undocumented noncitizens and nonimmigrants are ineligible for general assistance medical
care. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes
listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented noncitizen is an
individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a noncitizen who is ineligible for medical
assistance due to the deeming of a sponsor's income and resources, is ineligible for general
assistance medical care.
   (p) Effective July 1, 2003, general assistance medical care emergency services end.
   Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256D.03, subdivision 4, is amended to read:

    (17) prescribed medications for persons who have been diagnosed as mentally ill as necessary
to prevent more restrictive institutionalization;
   (18) psychological services, medical supplies and equipment, and Medicare premiums,
coinsurance and deductible payments;
    (19) medical equipment not specifically listed in this paragraph when the use of the equipment
will prevent the need for costlier services that are reimbursable under this subdivision;
    (20) services performed by a certified pediatric nurse practitioner, a certified family nurse
practitioner, a certified adult nurse practitioner, a certified obstetric/gynecological nurse practitioner,
a certified neonatal nurse practitioner, or a certified geriatric nurse practitioner in independent
practice, if (1) the service is otherwise covered under this chapter as a physician service, (2) the
service provided on an inpatient basis is not included as part of the cost for inpatient services
included in the operating payment rate, and (3) the service is within the scope of practice of the
nurse practitioner's license as a registered nurse, as defined in section 148.171;
    (21) services of a certified public health nurse or a registered nurse practicing in a public
health nursing clinic that is a department of, or that operates under the direct authority of, a unit of
government, if the service is within the scope of practice of the public health nurse's license as a
registered nurse, as defined in section 148.171;
   (22) telemedicine consultations, to the extent they are covered under section 256B.0625,
subdivision 3b; and
   (23) mental health telemedicine and psychiatric consultation as covered under section
256B.0625, subdivisions 46 and 48.
    (ii) Effective October 1, 2003, for a person who is eligible under subdivision 3, paragraph (a),
clause (2), item (ii), general assistance medical care coverage is limited to inpatient hospital services,
including physician services provided during the inpatient hospital stay. A $1,000 deductible is
required for each inpatient hospitalization.
   (b) Effective August 1, 2005, sex reassignment surgery is not covered under this subdivision.
    (c) In order to contain costs, the commissioner of human services shall select vendors of
medical care who can provide the most economical care consistent with high medical standards
and shall where possible contract with organizations on a prepaid capitation basis to provide these
services. The commissioner shall consider proposals by counties and vendors for prepaid health
plans, competitive bidding programs, block grants, or other vendor payment mechanisms designed
to provide services in an economical manner or to control utilization, with safeguards to ensure that
necessary services are provided. Before implementing prepaid programs in counties with a county
operated or affiliated public teaching hospital or a hospital or clinic operated by the University of
Minnesota, the commissioner shall consider the risks the prepaid program creates for the hospital
and allow the county or hospital the opportunity to participate in the program in a manner that
reflects the risk of adverse selection and the nature of the patients served by the hospital, provided
the terms of participation in the program are competitive with the terms of other participants
considering the nature of the population served. Payment for services provided pursuant to this
subdivision shall be as provided to medical assistance vendors of these services under sections
256B.02, subdivision 8, and 256B.0625. For payments made during fiscal year 1990 and later
330                                                        JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                                        [17TH DAY

employer contributions to Internal Revenue Code Section 125 plans and any other employer benefits
intended to pay health care costs as qualified employer subsidies toward the cost of health coverage
for employees for purposes of this subdivision.
    (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), if an employer-subsidized health plan requires the employee
to pay more than eight percent of the employee's family gross income in co-payments, deductibles,
or coinsurance, the health coverage offered shall not constitute employer-subsidized coverage for
purposes of determining eligibility for MinnesotaCare.
    (e) This subdivision does not apply to children.

   Sec. 47. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.09, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Eligibility as Minnesota resident. (a) For purposes of this section, a permanent
Minnesota resident is a person who has demonstrated, through persuasive and objective evidence,
that the person is domiciled in the state and intends to live in the state permanently.

subdivision 12a, paragraph (b), clause ­  (1
                                           ­­) (2);
   (2) demonstrating that the applicant has been continuously domiciled in the state for no less than
180 days immediately before the application; and
    (3) signing an affidavit declaring that (A) the applicant currently resides in the state and intends
to reside in the state permanently; and (B) the applicant did not come to the state for the primary
purpose of obtaining medical coverage or treatment.
   (c) A person who is temporarily absent from the state does not lose eligibility for MinnesotaCare.
"Temporarily absent from the state" means the person is out of the state for a temporary purpose
and intends to return when the purpose of the absence has been accomplished. A person is not
temporarily absent from the state if another state has determined that the person is a resident for any
purpose. If temporarily absent from the state, the person must follow the requirements of the health
plan in which the person is enrolled to receive services.
   Sec. 48. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.15, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Premium determination. (a) Families with children and individuals shall pay a
premium determined according to subdivision 2.
    (b) Pregnant women and children under age two are exempt from the provisions of section
256L.06, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), clause (3), requiring disenrollment for failure to pay
premiums. For pregnant women, this exemption continues until the first day of the month following
the 60th day postpartum. Women who remain enrolled during pregnancy or the postpartum period,
despite nonpayment of premiums, shall be disenrolled on the first of the month following the 60th
day postpartum for the penalty period that otherwise applies under section 256L.06, unless they
begin paying premiums.
    (c) Members of the military and their families who meet the eligibility criteria for MinnesotaCare
upon eligibility approval made within 24 months following the end of the member's tour of active
duty shall have their premiums paid by the commissioner. The effective date of coverage for an
individual or family who meets the criteria of this paragraph shall be the first day of the month
following the month in which eligibility is approved. This exemption shall apply for 12 months.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007, or upon federal approval, whichever
is later.
   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner

shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. The sliding fee scale begins with a premium of 1.5 percent
of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families with incomes below the
limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999,
and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1, 3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8
percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps ranging from the medical
assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1, 1999, to 275 percent of the
federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family size of five. The sliding fee
scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five. E                              ­­f­f­

                    i­ Families whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge
for one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum
premium, the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and
administration. In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of
the total. The costs of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and
the enrollees in these groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two
enrollees shall be twice the maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or
more enrollees shall be three times the maximum premium for one.
