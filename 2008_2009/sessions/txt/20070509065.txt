Dear President Metzen:

Dear Senator Metzen:
It is my honor to inform you that I have received, approved, signed, and deposited in the Office of
the Secretary of State, Chapter 57, Senate File 2096, with the exception of line item vetoes listed
65TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                         3793

below.
I have exercised a line item veto of the following appropriations:
Page 17, lines 17.29 - 18.11: A $150,000 appropriation, $75,000 each year, in Chapter 57, Article 1,
Section 4, for a shade-tree protection task force and grants. The DNR already works closely with the
Minnesota Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, other agencies, and private stakeholder
groups to provide these services. Creation and funding of a new task force would add minimal value
to ongoing efforts. In addition, the grants funded by this appropriation are not state-wide and would
be limited to St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Duluth.
Page 19, lines 19.18 - 19.20: A $10,000 appropriation in Chapter 57, Article 1, Section 4, for the
Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area Citizens Advisory Council. The Advisory Council funded
by this appropriation is established in Article 1, Section 40, of this bill. However, the activities and
duties described for the Advisory Council do not involve expenses or spending authority and there
appears to be no justification for $10,000 in funding.
Page 42, lines 42.23 - 42.34: A $200,000 appropriation in Chapter 57, Article 1, Section 5, for a
grant to the city of Gaylord for storm water and sewer reconstruction. Although this is an important
water quality initiative, it is more appropriately funded in an upcoming capital improvements bill,
either this year or in the traditional bonding year.
Page 142, line 142.19: Chapter 57, Article 2, Section 3, page 142, appropriates "$1,000,000 each
year" to the Center for Rural Policy and Development at Minnesota State University at Mankato to
make a grant to a non-profit organization. I am exercising an item veto to eliminate the words "each
year" from the appropriation, thereby eliminating the $1,000,000 appropriated for the second year.
As a result, the $1,000,000 appropriated for the first year of the biennium will remain in law and the
$1,000,000 for the second year of the biennium is vetoed and will not take effect. The $1,000,000
appropriated in the first year is a reasonable amount to fund the purposes of this grant. This bill also
provides $2 million from the Renewable Development fund for financial assistance to these types
of community wind projects.
Page 146, lines 146.10 - 146.25: A $45,000 appropriation for fiscal year 2008 in Chapter 57, Article
2, Section 3, to fund a grant to Linden Hills Power and Light for preliminary engineering and design
work. There are other potential avenues for this project to receive funding other than through a direct
appropriation from the state general fund. As the proponents move forward, I encourage them to
look at the wide array of available funds from other sources, such as the University of Minnesota's
Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment ("IREE") program or grants awarded by the
NextGen board.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Betzold moved that the line item veto message on S.F. No. 2096, be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 58, Senate File 2171, the Omnibus Health and Human
Services Bill.
As I have indicated previously, in order for a bill of this magnitude to gain my signature, the
Legislature must articulate an overall plan for revenues and expenditures. The health and human
services budget accounts for 28 percent of general fund and 34 percent of all funds spending,
so a complete budget picture is vitally important to setting priorities and determining reasonable
spending levels. We do not have such an agreement at this time. In addition, the level of spending
in this bill is excessive and it does not contain sufficient reforms. For these reasons, I am not able
to sign this bill.
The bill spends $277.5 million more in the general fund in FY08/09 and $445 million more in
FY10/11 than my recommended budget. When combined with the automatic spending increases in
the forecast of $1.2 billion, this bill would result in biennial spending growth of 19 percent­a rate
of growth that cannot be sustained.
This bill will spend over $3 billion more in the FY08/09 biennium than in the current biennium.
Under this bill, 56 percent of this general fund spending growth will go to support 28 percent of the
state's budget. While we can all agree that the services funded in this bill are important, this level
65TH DAY]                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                       3795

of increase is disproportionate and needs to be balanced with other key priorities.
Furthermore, this bill over-promises what is affordable in 2011 and beyond by backloading
proposals and delaying implementation dates to give the appearance of near-term affordability,
while creating automatic inflation and predictable fiscal pressure in years beyond the Legislature's
budget horizon. It also exacerbates human services' already ballooning trend lines. Although it is
difficult, taxpayers expect their elected officials to weigh and prioritize how limited tax dollars
should best be used.
As I have previously stated, I have serious concerns about the level of spending in the MFIP/TANF
program and provisions that will undo areas of past reform that will help recipients move toward
self-sufficiency. The conference report contains the following problematic provisions:
Reducing the portion of the MFIP support services grants that is based on county performance. This
is problematic as we will increasingly rely on county performance to achieve the new federal work
participation rates for the state's TANF program.
Restricting unpaid work experience. This is an important tool that counties have used judiciously
and with effect in increasing work participation.
Buying back equity adjustments to MFIP. Restricting the MFIP program from counting a portion of
SSI and subsidized housing when determining cash grants creates an inequity for MFIP participants
who don't have access to subsidized housing or who don't qualify for SSI.
Establishing a new Family Stabilization Program. In spite of changes in conference committee, this
program still shifts about twice as many people out of federally regulated MFIP as I recommended.
This shift, in addition to lenient sanction provisions, undermines the work focus of our cash program
for low-income families.
I share your goal of expanding health care coverage, especially for kids. However, this expansion
must be fiscally responsible and must be accompanied by changes that will improve quality and
slow the rate of growth in our health care system. The provisions in the bill that expand coverage
have significant future budget implications and are not accompanied with sufficient reforms to
make this investment sustainable. The bill contains several proposals that restore changes to the
MinnesotaCare program that will lead us back to growth rates for these programs that are unsound.
I also cannot support proposals that expand public coverage at the expense of private coverage.
The conference report phases in rebasing of operating rates over five years, with changes to property
rates, special facility rates, and recognition of performance in FYs 2012, FY 2013, and FY 2014.
The only explanation for this approach is to delay recognition of the significant cost of rebasing in
the budget. This approach is inherently inflationary and cannot be described as sustainable when the
cost of the policy changes being made is not recognized within the budget horizon. Furthermore,
this approach rewards the status quo and continues the geographic disparities inherent in the current
payment system.
Language is included prohibiting the declaration of "essential" status for security counselors who
guard convicted sex offenders. These state employees provide security for sex offenders who have
been indefinitely confined in a locked and secured facility because the courts have determined them
to be potentially dangerous and a threat to the general public. This provision interferes with the
legislatively established process of making these employees "essential" and may create a threat to
3796                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [65TH DAY

the well being of the citizens of Minnesota should state workers go on strike.
The bill includes language pertaining to state employee compensation increases that cannot be
effectively implemented. Other conference reports have dropped similar language.
As I indicated in my letter to conferees on April 26, the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange and
expanded use of section 125 pre-tax premium-only plans are vital to increasing the affordability
of health coverage for Minnesotans participating in the individual insurance market, while also
increasing the accessibility and transparency of that market. Underfunding the establishment of
the Exchange will undermine the development of this important component of health reform. In
addition, language added requiring that health plans operating through the Exchange have an 82
percent minimum loss ratio is unacceptable and will severely limit the ability of the Exchange to
foster competition among health plans. It will also ultimately result in even further consolidation in
the individual health insurance market in Minnesota.
Even if my concerns about these policy provisions were to be resolved, I am unable to approve this
bill until the Legislature more fully identifies an overall budget plan. My hope is that the Legislature
will present comprehensive budget targets soon so that work on this, and other important budget
bills, can proceed in a timely manner.
My staff and I look forward to working with you in this regard.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor

                                HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.1384, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Residential homestead market value credit. (a) Each county auditor shall
determine a homestead credit for each class 1a, 1b, and 2a homestead property within the county
equal to 0.4 percent of the first $76,000 of market value of the property minus .09 percent of the
market value in excess of $76,000. The credit amount may not be less than zero. In the case of
an agricultural or resort homestead, only the market value of the house, garage, and immediately
surrounding one acre of land is eligible in determining the property's homestead credit. In the
case of a property that is classified as part homestead and part nonhomestead, (i) the credit shall
apply only to the homestead portion of the property, but (ii) if a portion of a property is classified
as nonhomestead solely because not all the owners occupy the property, not all the owners have
qualifying relatives occupying the property, or solely because not all the spouses of owners occupy
the property, the credit amount shall be initially computed as if that nonhomestead portion were
also in the homestead class and then prorated to the owner-occupant's percentage of ownership.
For the purpose of this section, when an owner-occupant's spouse does not occupy the property,
the percentage of ownership for the owner-occupant spouse is one-half of the couple's ownership
percentage.
     (b) For property taxes payable in 2008 and thereafter, the county auditor shall determine the
amount of the homestead credit under paragraph (a) and this paragraph. The county auditor shall
report the amount of the credit to the taxpayer on the property tax statement or in another manner, as
authorized by the commissioner of revenue. The amount of the credit allowed for the property taxes
payable year is to be computed as the following percentage of the credit amount under paragraph
(a):
   (1) for property taxes payable in 2008, 100 percent;
   (2) for property taxes payable in 2009, 60 percent;
   (3) for property taxes payable in 2010, 30 percent; and
   (4) for property taxes payable in 2011 or thereafter, no credit is allowed.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning for property taxes payable in 2008.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276.04, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
     Subd. 2. Contents of tax statements. (a) The treasurer shall provide for the printing of the tax
statements. The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the property tax statement and
its contents. The statement must contain a tabulated statement of the dollar amount due to each taxing
authority and the amount of the state tax from the parcel of real property for which a particular tax
statement is prepared. The dollar amounts attributable to the county, the state tax, the voter approved
school tax, the other local school tax, the township or municipality, and the total of the metropolitan
special taxing districts as defined in section 275.065, subdivision 3, paragraph (i), must be separately
stated. The amounts due all other special taxing districts, if any, may be aggregated except that any
levies made by the regional rail authorities in the county of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,
Ramsey, Scott, or Washington under chapter 398A shall be listed on a separate line directly under
the appropriate county's levy. If the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for a lake
improvement district as defined under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for
3804                                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                        [65TH DAY

that purpose must be separately stated from the remaining county levy amount. In the case of Ramsey
County, if the county levy under this paragraph includes an amount for public library service under
section 134.07, the amount attributable for that purpose may be separated from the remaining county
levy amount. The amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior citizens' property tax
deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before subtraction of the
deferred property tax amount. The amount of the tax on contamination value imposed under sections
270.91 to 270.98, if any, must also be separately stated. The dollar amounts, including the dollar
amount of any special assessments, may be rounded to the nearest even whole dollar. For purposes of
this section whole odd-numbered dollars may be adjusted to the next higher even-numbered dollar.
The amount of market value excluded under section 273.11, subdivision 16, if any, must also be
listed on the tax statement.
   (b) The property tax statements for manufactured homes and sectional structures taxed as
personal property shall contain the same information that is required on the tax statements for real
property.
   (c) Real and personal property tax statements must contain the following information in the order
given in this paragraph. The information must contain the current year tax information in the right
column with the corresponding information for the previous year in a column on the left:
     (1) the property's estimated market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1;
   (2) the property's taxable market value after reductions under section 273.11, subdivisions 1a
and 16;

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2008 and thereafter.
     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290A.03, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
    Subd. 13. Property taxes payable. "Property taxes payable" means the property tax exclusive of
special assessments, penalties, and interest payable on a claimant's homestead after deductions made
under sections 273.135, ­  27

                                     ­­273.1391,
                                       ,         273.42, subdivision 2, and any other state paid property
tax credits in any calendar year, and after any refund claimed and allowable under section 290A.04,
subdivision 2h, that is first payable in the year that the property tax is payable. Beginning for property
taxes payable in 2008, the amount of the credit under section 273.1384, subdivision 1, must not be
deducted in computing property taxes payable. In the case of a claimant who makes ground lease
payments, "property taxes payable" includes the amount of the payments directly attributable to
the property taxes assessed against the parcel on which the house is located. No apportionment or
reduction of the "property taxes payable" shall be required for the use of a portion of the claimant's
homestead for a business purpose if the claimant does not deduct any business depreciation expenses
for the use of a portion of the homestead in the determination of federal adjusted gross income. For
homesteads which are manufactured homes as defined in section 273.125, subdivision 8, and for
homesteads which are park trailers taxed as manufactured homes under section 168.012, subdivision
9, "property taxes payable" shall also include 19 percent of the gross rent paid in the preceding year
for the site on which the homestead is located. When a homestead is owned by two or more persons
as joint tenants or tenants in common, such tenants shall determine between them which tenant may
claim the property taxes payable on the homestead. If they are unable to agree, the matter shall be
referred to the commissioner of revenue whose decision shall be final. Property taxes are considered
payable in the year prescribed by law for payment of the taxes.
    In the case of a claim relating to "property taxes payable," the claimant must have owned and
occupied the homestead on January 2 of the year in which the tax is payable and (i) the property must
have been classified as homestead property pursuant to section 273.124, on or before December 15
of the assessment year to which the "property taxes payable" relate; or (ii) the claimant must provide
documentation from the local assessor that application for homestead classification has been made
on or before December 15 of the year in which the "property taxes payable" were payable and that
the assessor has approved the application.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning for refund claims based on property
taxes payable in 2008.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290A.04, subdivision 2a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2a. Renters. (a) A claimant whose rent constituting property taxes exceeds the percentage
of the household income stated below must pay an amount equal to the percent of income shown
for the appropriate household income level along with the percent to be paid by the claimant of the
remaining amount of rent constituting property taxes. The state refund equals the amount of rent
constituting property taxes that remain, up to the maximum state refund amount shown below.

more than 12 percent over the property taxes payable in the prior year on the same property that is
owned and occupied by the same owner on January 2 of both years, and the amount of that increase
is $100 or more, a claimant who is a homeowner shall be allowed an additional refund equal to 60
percent of the amount of the increase over the greater of 12 percent of the prior year's property taxes
payable or $100. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes payable
attributable to improvements made to the homestead after the assessment date for the prior year's
taxes. This subdivision shall not apply to any increase in the gross property taxes payable attributable
to the termination of valuation exclusions under section 273.11, subdivision 16, or to the reduction
in and elimination of the homestead market value credit under section 273.1384, subdivision 1,
paragraph (b).
   The maximum refund allowed under this subdivision is $1,000.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision "gross property taxes payable" means property taxes payable
determined without regard to the refund allowed under this subdivision.

shall file with the property tax refund return a copy of the property tax statement for taxes payable
in the preceding year or other documents required by the commissioner.

the property taxpayers who may be eligible for the additional property tax refund under this section.
The information shall be provided on a magnetic computer disk. The county may recover its costs
by charging the person requesting the information the reasonable cost for preparing the data. The
information may not be used for any purpose other than for notifying the homeowner of potential
eligibility and assisting the homeowner, without charge, in preparing a refund claim.

authorities required to hold a public meeting under subdivision 6, the notice must clearly state that
each taxing authority, including regional library districts established under section 134.201, and
including the metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), but excluding all other special

    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed

Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under section 134.07 may be listed separately from the
remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal
disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured
value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity subject to the areawide tax must each be stated
separately and not included in the sum of the special taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior

subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond

    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
   (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and

lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;
   (3) state or federal government action; and
   (4) other financial factors that affect the level of property taxation and local services that the
governing body of the county, city, or school district may deem appropriate to include.
   The information may be presented using tables, written narrative, and graphic representations
and may contain instruction toward further sources of information or opportunity for comment.

    (d) In lieu of a tax computed according to the rates set forth in this subdivision, the tax of
any individual taxpayer whose taxable net income for the taxable year is less than an amount
determined by the commissioner must be computed in accordance with tables prepared and issued
by the commissioner of revenue based on income brackets of not more than $100. The amount of
tax for each bracket shall be computed at the rates set forth in this subdivision, provided that the
commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.
    (e) An individual who is not a Minnesota resident for the entire year must compute the
individual's Minnesota income tax as provided in this subdivision. After the application of the
nonrefundable credits provided in this chapter, the tax liability must then be multiplied by a fraction
in which:
    (1) the numerator is the individual's Minnesota source federal adjusted gross income as defined
in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code and increased by the additions required under section
290.01, subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and reduced by the Minnesota
assignable portion of the subtraction for United States government interest under section 290.01,
subdivision 19b, clause (1), and the subtractions under section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses
(9), (10), (14), (15), and (16), after applying the allocation and assignability provisions of section
290.081, clause (a), or 290.17; and
    (2) the denominator is the individual's federal adjusted gross income as defined in section
62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, increased by the amounts specified in section 290.01,
subdivision 19a, clauses (1), (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9), and reduced by the amounts specified in
section 290.01, subdivision 19b, clauses (1), (9), (10), (14), (15), and (16).

any rate bracket must not be changed. The dollar amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted to
reflect the changes in the rate brackets. The rate brackets as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest
$10 amount. If the rate bracket ends in $5, it must be rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.

    Subd. 27. Reportable transaction understatement. (a) If a taxpayer has a reportable
transaction understatement for any taxable year, an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of
the reportable transaction understatement must be added to the tax.
   (b)(1) For purposes of this subdivision, "reportable transaction understatement" means the
product of:
    (i) the amount of the increase, if any, in taxable income that results from a difference between
the proper tax treatment of an item to which this section applies and the taxpayer's treatment of that
item as shown on the taxpayer's tax return; and
   (ii) the highest rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer under section 290.06 determined without
regard to the understatement.
    (2) For purposes of clause (1)(i), any reduction of the excess of deductions allowed for the
taxable year over gross income for that year, and any reduction in the amount of capital losses which
would, without regard to section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code, be allowed for that year, must
be treated as an increase in taxable income.
   (c) This subdivision applies to any item that is attributable to:
   (1) any listed transaction under section 289A.121; and
    (2) any reportable transaction, other than a listed transaction, if a significant purpose of that
transaction is the avoidance or evasion of federal income tax liability.
    (d) Paragraph (a) applies by substituting "30 percent" for "20 percent" with respect to the portion
of any reportable transaction understatement with respect to which the disclosure requirements of
section 289A.121, subdivision 5, and section 6664(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code are not
met.
    (e)(1) No penalty applies under this subdivision with respect to any portion of a reportable
transaction understatement if the taxpayer shows that there was reasonable cause for the portion
and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to the portion. This paragraph applies only if:
   (i) the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of the item are adequately disclosed as required
under section 289A.121;
   (ii) there is or was substantial authority for the treatment; and
    (iii) the taxpayer reasonably believed that the treatment was more likely than not the proper
treatment.
    (2) A taxpayer who did not adequately disclose under section 289A.121 meets the requirements
of clause (1)(i), if the commissioner abates the penalty imposed by subdivision 26, paragraph (d),

                        ­ subdivision 26, paragraph (g).
    (3) For purposes of clause (1)(iii), a taxpayer is treated as having a reasonable belief with respect
to the tax treatment of an item only if the belief:
     (i) is based on the facts and law that exist when the return of tax which includes the tax treatment
is filed; and
65TH DAY]                          WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                         3827

    (ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits of the treatment and does not
take into account the possibility that a return will not be audited, the treatment will not be raised on
audit, or the treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.
   (4) An opinion of a tax advisor may not be relied upon to establish the reasonable belief of a
taxpayer if:
   (i) the tax advisor:
    (A) is a material advisor, as defined in section 289A.121, and participates in the organization,
management, promotion, or sale of the transaction or is related (within the meaning of section 267(b)
or 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) to any person who so participates;
   (B) is compensated directly or indirectly by a material advisor with respect to the transaction;
    (C) has a fee arrangement with respect to the transaction which is contingent on all or part of
the intended tax benefits from the transaction being sustained; or
   (D) has a disqualifying financial interest with respect to the transaction, as determined
under United States Treasury regulations prescribed to implement the provisions of section
6664(d)(3)(B)(ii)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (ii) the opinion:
   (A) is based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions, including assumptions as to future
events;
    (B) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer
or any other person;
   (C) does not identify and consider all relevant facts; or
   (D) fails to meet any other requirement as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe under
federal law.
   (f) The penalty imposed by this subdivision applies in lieu of the penalty imposed under
subdivision 4.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

or claim for refund prepared by a "tax refund or return preparer" as defined in subdivision 13,
paragraph (f), shall bear the identification number the preparer is required to use federally under
section 6109(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. A tax refund or return preparer who prepares a
Minnesota individual income tax return or claim for refund and fails to include the required number
on the return or claim is subject to a penalty of $50 for each failure.

290.0674, not to exceed $1,625 for each qualifying child in grades kindergarten to 6 and $2,500 for

Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the word "1999" shall be substituted for the word
"1992." For 2001, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months
ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2000, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the
year preceding the taxable year. The determination of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision
must not be considered a "rule" and is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act contained
in chapter 14. The threshold amount as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest $10 amount. If the

meanings in this subdivision.
    (b) "Deposit" means the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a financial
institution in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit,
either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account
whether or not advance notice is required to withdraw the credited funds, or which is evidenced by
its certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, or certificate of indebtedness, or
other similar name, or a check or draft drawn against a deposit account and certified by the financial
institution, or a letter of credit or a traveler's check on which the financial institution is primarily
liable. However, without limiting the generality of the term "money or its equivalent," any such
account or instrument must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when
credited or issued in exchange for checks or drafts or for a promissory note upon which the person
obtaining the credit or instrument is primarily or secondarily liable, or for a charge against a deposit
account, or in settlement of checks, drafts, or other instruments forwarded to the bank for collection.

trust department or held or deposited in any other department of the financial institution.

money or its equivalent received or held by a financial institution, in the usual course of business for a
special or specific purpose, regardless of the legal relationship so established. Under this paragraph,

the financial institution or others, including funds held as dealers reserves, or for securities loaned by
the financial institution, funds deposited by a debtor to meet maturing obligations, funds deposited as
advance payment on subscriptions to United States government securities, funds held for distribution
or purchase of securities, funds held to meet its acceptances or letters of credit, and withheld taxes. It

does not include funds received by the financial institution for immediate application to the reduction
of an indebtedness to the receiving financial institution, or under condition that the receipt of the
funds immediately reduces or extinguishes the indebtedness.
    (e) "Deposit" means outstanding drafts, including advice or another such institution, cashier's
checks, money orders, or other officer's checks issued in the usual course of business for any purpose,
but not including those issued in payment for services, dividends, or purchases or other costs or
expenses of the financial institution itself.
   (f) "Deposit" means money or its equivalent held as a credit balance by a financial institution on
behalf of its customer if the entity is engaged in soliciting and holding such balances in the regular

when the bad debt was (1) written off as uncollectible in the taxpayer's books and records, and (2)
either eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes or would have been eligible for a bad
debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the taxpayer were required to file a federal income
tax return, or within one year from the date the taxpayer's federal income tax return is timely filed
claiming the bad debt deduction, whichever period is later. The refund or credit is limited to the
amount of overpayment attributable to the loss. "Bad debt" for purposes of this subdivision, has
the same meaning as that term is used in United States Code, title 26, section 166, except that for
a claim relating to an overpayment of taxes under chapter 297A the following are excluded from
the calculation of bad debt: financing charges or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase
price; uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full
purchase price is paid; expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt; and repossessed property.
For purposes of reporting a payment received on previously claimed bad debt under chapter 297A,
any payments made on a debt or account are applied first proportionally to the taxable price of the
property or service and the sales tax on it, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other
charges.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

penalty of five percent of the amount of tax not properly reported on the return. A person who files a
consolidated tax return but fails to report location information is subject to a $500 penalty for each
return not containing location information. In addition, the commissioner may revoke the privilege
for a taxpayer to file consolidated returns and may require the taxpayer to separately register each
location and to file a tax return for each location.

that are allowed by the seller and taken by a purchaser on a sale;
    (2) interest, financing, and carrying charges from credit extended on the sale of personal property
or services, if the amount is separately stated on the invoice, bill of sale, or similar document given
to the purchaser; and
    (3) any taxes legally imposed directly on the consumer that are separately stated on the invoice,
bill of sale, or similar document given to the purchaser.
    (c) Sales price includes consideration received by the seller from third parties if:
   (1) the seller actually receives consideration from a party other than the purchaser and the
consideration is directly related to a price reduction or discount on the sale;

    (3) the amount of the consideration attributable to the sale is fixed and determinable by the seller
at the time of the sale of the item to the purchaser; and
     (4) one of the following criteria is met:
    (i) the purchaser presents a coupon, certificate, or other documentation to the seller to claim a
price reduction or discount when the coupon, certificate, or documentation is authorized, distributed,

whom the coupon, certificate, or documentation is presented;
    (ii) the purchaser identifies himself or herself to the seller as a member of a group or organization
entitled to a price reduction or discount. A "preferred customer" card that is available to any customer

the invoice received by the purchaser or on a coupon, certificate, or other documentation presented
by the purchaser.

     Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 297A.61, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 38. Bundled transaction. (a) "Bundled transaction" means the retail sale of two or more
products when the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the products are sold for

one nonitemized price. As used in this subdivision, "product" includes tangible personal property,
services, intangibles, and digital goods, but does not include real property or services to real property.
A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or
is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction.
   (b) For purposes of this subdivision, "distinct and identifiable" products does not include:
    (1) packaging and other materials, such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles, wrapping,
labels, tags, and instruction guides, that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental
or immaterial to the retail sale. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include
grocery sacks, shoe boxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes;
    (2) a promotional product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product.
A promotional product is provided free of charge if the sales price of another product, which is
required to be purchased in order to receive the promotional product, does not vary depending on
the inclusion of the promotional product; and
   (3) items included in the definition of sales price.
    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "one nonitemized price" does not include a
price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related
documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form including, but not
limited to an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic
notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list.
    (d) A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not a bundled
transaction if it is:
    (1) the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service and the tangible personal property
is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and
the true object of the transaction is the service;
    (2) the retail sale of services if one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of
a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service
and the true object of the transaction is the second service;
    (3) a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price
or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis; or
   (4) the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property if:
  (i) the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment,
mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; and
    (ii) the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent
or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers
must not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property
when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction.
    (e) For purposes of this subdivision, "purchase price" means the measure subject to use tax on

the taxes payable in the following year.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning January 2, 2007, for taxes payable in
2008 and thereafter.
    Sec. 5. [270.0725] PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. Penalty for late filing. If an airline company does not file its annual report by the
date designated in section 270.072, subdivision 3, a penalty of five percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company. On August 1, and on the first day of each succeeding calendar month,
an additional five percent penalty is imposed if the report has not yet been filed. For each airline
company, the penalties imposed under this subdivision for any one year are limited to the lesser of
$25,000 or 25 percent of the assessed tax.
    Subd. 2. Penalty for repeated instances of late filing. If there is a pattern of repeated failures
by an airline company to timely file the report required by this section, a penalty of ten percent of
the tax being assessed is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for frivolous report. If an airline company files a frivolous annual report, a
penalty of 25 percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company. A frivolous report under
this section is a report that would fulfill the criteria for a frivolous return under section 289A.60,
subdivision 7, notwithstanding the restriction in section 289A.01. In a proceeding involving the
issue of whether or not an airline company is liable for this penalty, the burden of proof is on the
commissioner.
    Subd. 4. Penalty for fraudulent report. If an airline company files a false or fraudulent annual
report with intent to evade or defeat the tax, a penalty equal to 50 percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 5. Penalties added to tax. Penalties imposed under this section are added to the tax and
collected as a part of it.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for annual reports due on or after July 1, 2007.
    Sec. 6. [270.0735] EXAMINATION; INVESTIGATIONS; SUBPOENAS.
    In addition to the powers granted to the commissioner in this chapter, and in order to determine
net tax capacities and issue notices of net tax capacity and tax under sections 270.071 to 270.079,
the commissioner has the powers contained in sections 270C.31 and 270C.32, for which purpose
the word "taxpayer" as defined in section 270C.01 includes an airline company.

assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed or performing the duties of the assessor
under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in immediate revocation of the individual's
license to assess property for property tax purposes. This prohibition must not be construed to
prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required for the proper assessment of property
for property tax purposes. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing body of a
governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this prohibition
does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the governmental
unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only allow appraisal
activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, or special assessments.

    (c) Land that previously qualified for tax deferment under this section and no longer qualifies
because it is not primarily used for agricultural purposes but would otherwise qualify under
subdivisions 3 and 6 for a period of at least three years will not be required to make payment of
the previously deferred taxes, notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 9. Sale of the land
prior to the expiration of the three-year period requires payment of deferred taxes as follows: sale
in the year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus
payment of deferred taxes for the two prior years; sale during the second year the land no longer
qualifies requires payment of the current year's deferred taxes plus payment of the deferred taxes
for the prior year; and sale during the third year the land no longer qualifies requires payment of
the current year's deferred taxes. Deferred taxes shall be paid even if the land qualifies pursuant to
subdivision 11a. When such property is sold or no longer qualifies under this paragraph, or at the
end of the three-year period, whichever comes first, all deferred special assessments plus interest
are payable in equal installments spread over the time remaining until the last maturity date of the
bonds issued to finance the improvement for which the assessments were levied. If the bonds have
matured, the deferred special assessments plus interest are payable within 90 days. The provisions
of section 429.061, subdivision 2, apply to the collection of these installments. Penalties are not
imposed on any such special assessments if timely paid.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

    273.121 VALUATION OF REAL PROPERTY, NOTICE.
    Any county assessor or city assessor having the powers of a county assessor, valuing or
classifying taxable real property shall in each year notify those persons whose property is to be
included on the assessment roll that year if the person's address is known to the assessor, otherwise
the occupant of the property. The notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by ordinary mail at
least ten days before the meeting of the local board of appeal and equalization under section 274.01
or the review process established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c. Upon written request by
the owner of the property, the assessor may send the notice in electronic form or by electronic
mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail. It shall contain: (1) the market value for the current
and prior assessment, (2) the limited market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1a, for the
current and prior assessment, (3) the qualifying amount of any improvements under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, for the current assessment, (4) the market value subject to taxation after subtracting
the amount of any qualifying improvements for the current assessment, (5) the classification of the
property for the current and prior assessment, (6) a note that if the property is homestead and at
least 45 years old, improvements made to the property may be eligible for a valuation exclusion
under section 273.11, subdivision 16, (7) the assessor's office address, and (8) the dates, places,
and times set for the meetings of the local board of appeal and equalization, the review process
established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c, and the county board of appeal and equalization.
The commissioner of revenue shall specify the form of the notice. The assessor shall attach to the
assessment roll a statement that the notices required by this section have been mailed. Any assessor
who is not provided sufficient funds from the assessor's governing body to provide such notices,
may make application to the commissioner of revenue to finance such notices. The commissioner
of revenue shall conduct an investigation and, if satisfied that the assessor does not have the
necessary funds, issue a certification to the commissioner of finance of the amount necessary to
provide such notices. The commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant for such amount and shall
deduct such amount from any state payment to such county or municipality. The necessary funds
to make such payments are hereby appropriated. Failure to receive the notice shall in no way
affect the validity of the assessment, the resulting tax, the procedures of any board of review or
equalization, or the enforcement of delinquent taxes by statutory means.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices required in 2008 and thereafter.

homestead property located within a disaster or emergency area which is physically damaged by
the disaster or emergency and shall adjust the valuation for taxes payable the following year to

property as reassessed from the market value of the property as assessed under section 273.01 for

    (c) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and
Social Security number appear on homestead applications for two separate residences and only one
application is signed, the owner or spouse will be deemed to have elected to homestead the residence
for which the application was signed.

county treasurer.
    (d) If residential real estate is occupied and used for purposes of a homestead by a relative of the
owner and qualifies for a homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (c), in order for the property
to receive homestead status, a homestead application must be filed with the assessor. The Social

homestead until the property is sold or transferred to another person, or the owners, the spouse of the
owner, or the relatives no longer use the property as their homestead. Upon the sale or transfer of the
homestead property, a certificate of value must be timely filed with the county auditor as provided
under section 272.115. Failure to notify the assessor within 30 days that the property has been sold,
transferred, or that the owner, the spouse of the owner, or the relative is no longer occupying the
property as a homestead, shall result in the penalty provided under this subdivision and the property
will lose its current homestead status.
    (f) If the homestead application is not returned within 30 days, the county will send a second
application to the present owners of record. The notice of proposed property taxes prepared under
section 275.065, subdivision 3, shall reflect the property's classification. B ­­

under the law, including for the detection of improper claims by owners, or relatives of owners,
under chapter 290A.
     (h) If the commissioner finds that a property owner may be claiming a fraudulent homestead,
the commissioner shall notify the appropriate counties. Within 90 days of the notification, the
county assessor shall investigate to determine if the homestead classification was properly claimed.
If the property owner does not qualify, the county assessor shall notify the county auditor who will
determine the amount of homestead benefits that had been improperly allowed. For the purpose
65TH DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                         3879

of this section, "homestead benefits" means the tax reduction resulting from the classification
as a homestead under section 273.13, the taconite homestead credit under section 273.135,
the residential homestead and agricultural homestead credits under section 273.1384, and the
supplemental homestead credit under section 273.1391.
    The county auditor shall send a notice to the person who owned the affected property at the time
the homestead application related to the improper homestead was filed, demanding reimbursement
of the homestead benefits plus a penalty equal to 100 percent of the homestead benefits. The person
notified may appeal the county's determination by serving copies of a petition for review with county
officials as provided in section 278.01 and filing proof of service as provided in section 278.01 with
the Minnesota Tax Court within 60 days of the date of the notice from the county. Procedurally,
the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    (i) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner shall be
distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located in the same
proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts' levy for the
current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be transmitted
to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account. Any
amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to the
commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount of
penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.
   (j) If a property owner has applied for more than one homestead and the county assessors cannot

determine which property should be classified as homestead, the county assessors will refer the
information to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the determination and notify the
counties within 60 days.
     (k) In addition to lists of homestead properties, the commissioner may ask the counties to furnish
lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and federal identification
numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax administration purposes,
and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or nonpublic data; but may be
viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the same county for the limited
purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata samples under section
270C.12.
    (l) On or before April 30 each year beginning in 2007, each county must provide the
commissioner with the following data for each parcel of homestead property by electronic means
as defined in section 289A.02, subdivision 8:
    (i) the property identification number assigned to the parcel for purposes of taxes payable in the
current year;
    (ii) the name and Social Security number of each occupant of homestead property who is the

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Ordinary board; meetings, deadlines, grievances. (a) The town board of a
town, or the council or other governing body of a city, is the board of appeal and equalization except
(1) in cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization or (2) in any city or town that has
transferred its local board of review power and duties to the county board as provided in subdivision
3. The county assessor shall fix a day and time when the board or the board of equalization shall meet
in the assessment districts of the county. Notwithstanding any law or city charter to the contrary, a
city board of equalization shall be referred to as a board of appeal and equalization. On or before
February 15 of each year the assessor shall give written notice of the time to the city or town clerk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, the meetings must be held between
April 1 and May 31 each year. The clerk shall give published and posted notice of the meeting at
least ten days before the date of the meeting.
    The board shall meet at the office of the clerk to review the assessment and classification of
property in the town or city. No changes in valuation or classification which are intended to correct
errors in judgment by the county assessor may be made by the county assessor after the board
has adjourned in those cities or towns that hold a local board of review; however, corrections of
errors that are merely clerical in nature or changes that extend homestead treatment to property are
permitted after adjournment until the tax extension date for that assessment year. The changes must
be fully documented and maintained in the assessor's office and must be available for review by
any person. A copy of the changes made during this period in those cities or towns that hold a local
board of review must be sent to the county board no later than December 31 of the assessment year.
65TH DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                         3883

    (b) The board shall determine whether the taxable property in the town or city has been properly
placed on the list and properly valued by the assessor. If real or personal property has been omitted,
the board shall place it on the list with its market value, and correct the assessment so that each
tract or lot of real property, and each article, parcel, or class of personal property, is entered on the
assessment list at its market value. No assessment of the property of any person may be raised unless
the person has been duly notified of the intent of the board to do so. On application of any person
feeling aggrieved, the board shall review the assessment or classification, or both, and correct it as
appears just. The board may not make an individual market value adjustment or classification change
that would benefit the property if the owner or other person having control over the property has
refused the assessor access to inspect the property and the interior of any buildings or structures as
provided in section 273.20. A board member shall not participate in any actions of the board which
result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by the board member,
the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has a financial interest.
The relationship may be by blood or marriage.
     (c) A local board may reduce assessments upon petition of the taxpayer but the total reductions
must not reduce the aggregate assessment made by the county assessor by more than one percent.
If the total reductions would lower the aggregate assessments made by the county assessor by more
than one percent, none of the adjustments may be made. The assessor shall correct any clerical errors
or double assessments discovered by the board without regard to the one percent limitation.
   (d) A local board does not have authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
    (e) A majority of the members may act at the meeting, and adjourn from day to day until they
finish hearing the cases presented. The assessor shall attend, with the assessment books and papers,
and take part in the proceedings, but must not vote. The county assessor, or an assistant delegated
by the county assessor shall attend the meetings. The board shall list separately, on a form appended
to the assessment book, all omitted property added to the list by the board and all items of property
increased or decreased, with the market value of each item of property, added or changed by the
board, placed opposite the item. The county assessor shall enter all changes made by the board in
the assessment book.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 3, if a person fails to appear in person, by counsel, or by
written communication before the board after being duly notified of the board's intent to raise the
assessment of the property, or if a person feeling aggrieved by an assessment or classification fails to
apply for a review of the assessment or classification, the person may not appear before the county
board of appeal and equalization for a review of the assessment or classification. This paragraph
does not apply if an assessment was made after the local board meeting, as provided in section
273.01, or if the person can establish not having received notice of market value at least five days
before the local board meeting.
    (g) The local board must complete its work and adjourn within 20 days from the time of
convening stated in the notice of the clerk, unless a longer period is approved by the commissioner
of revenue. No action taken after that date is valid. All complaints about an assessment or
classification made after the meeting of the board must be heard and determined by the county
board of equalization. A nonresident may, at any time, before the meeting of the board file written
objections to an assessment or classification with the county assessor. The objections must be

presented to the board at its meeting by the county assessor for its consideration.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 38. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.13, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Members; meetings; rules for equalizing assessments. The county
commissioners, or a majority of them, with the county auditor, or, if the auditor cannot be present,
the deputy county auditor, or, if there is no deputy, the court administrator of the district court,
shall form a board for the equalization of the assessment of the property of the county, including
the property of all cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization. This board shall be
referred to as the county board of appeal and equalization. The board shall meet annually, on the
date specified in section 274.14, at the office of the auditor. Each member shall take an oath to
fairly and impartially perform duties as a member. Members shall not participate in any actions of
the board which result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by
the board member, the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother,
sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has
a financial interest. The relationship may be by blood or marriage. The board shall examine and
compare the returns of the assessment of property of the towns or districts, and equalize them so
that each tract or lot of real property and each article or class of personal property is entered on the
assessment list at its market value, subject to the following rules:
    (1) The board shall raise the valuation of each tract or lot of real property which in its opinion is
returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. The board must first give
notice of intention to raise the valuation to the person in whose name it is assessed, if the person is
a resident of the county. The notice must fix a time and place for a hearing.
    (2) The board shall reduce the valuation of each tract or lot which in its opinion is returned above
its market value to the sum believed to be its market value.
    (3) The board shall raise the valuation of each class of personal property which in its opinion
is returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. It shall raise the
aggregate value of the personal property of individuals, firms, or corporations, when it believes that
the aggregate valuation, as returned, is less than the market value of the taxable personal property
possessed by the individuals, firms, or corporations, to the sum it believes to be the market value.
The board must first give notice to the persons of intention to do so. The notice must set a time and
place for a hearing.
    (4) The board shall reduce the valuation of each class of personal property that is returned above
its market value to the sum it believes to be its market value. Upon complaint of a party aggrieved,
the board shall reduce the aggregate valuation of the individual's personal property, or of any class
of personal property for which the individual is assessed, which in its opinion has been assessed at
too large a sum, to the sum it believes was the market value of the individual's personal property of
that class.
    (5) The board must not reduce the aggregate value of all the property of its county, as submitted
to the county board of equalization, with the additions made by the auditor under this chapter, by
more than one percent of its whole valuation. The board may raise the aggregate valuation of real
property, and of each class of personal property, of the county, or of any town or district of the
county, when it believes it is below the market value of the property, or class of property, to the

aggregate amount it believes to be its market value.
    (6) The board shall change the classification of any property which in its opinion is not properly
classified.
   (7) The board does not have the authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 39. [274.135] COUNTY BOARDS; APPEALS AND EQUALIZATION COURSE
AND MEETING REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Handbook for county boards. By no later than January 1, 2009, the
commissioner of revenue must develop a handbook detailing procedures, responsibilities, and
requirements for county boards of appeal and equalization. The handbook must include, but need
not be limited to, the role of the county board in the assessment process, the legal and policy
reasons for fair and impartial appeal and equalization hearings, county board meeting procedures
that foster fair and impartial assessment reviews and other best practices recommendations, quorum
requirements for county boards, and explanations of alternate methods of appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeals and equalization course. Beginning in 2009, and each year thereafter, there
must be at least one member at each meeting of a county board of appeal and equalization who has
attended an appeals and equalization course developed or approved by the commissioner within the
last four years, as certified by the commissioner. The course may be offered in conjunction with a
meeting of the Minnesota Association of Assessment Officers. The course content must include, but
need not be limited to, a review of the handbook developed by the commissioner under subdivision
1.
    Subd. 3. Proof of compliance; transfer of duties. (a) Any county that conducts county boards
of appeal and equalization meetings must provide proof to the commissioner by December 1, 2009,
and each year thereafter, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subdivision 2. Beginning
in 2009, this notice must also verify that there was a quorum of voting members at each meeting
of the board of appeal and equalization in the current year. A county that does not comply with
these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization powers to the
special board of equalization appointed pursuant to section 274.13, subdivision 2, beginning with
the following year's assessment and continuing unless the powers are reinstated under paragraph
(c). A county that does not comply with the requirements of subdivision 2 and has not appointed
a special board of equalization shall appoint a special board of equalization before the following
year's assessment.
    (b) The county shall notify the taxpayers when the board of appeal and equalization for a county
has been transferred to the special board of equalization under this subdivision and, prior to the
meeting time of the special board of equalization, the county shall make available to those taxpayers
a procedure for a review of the assessments, including, but not limited to, open book meetings. This
alternate review process must take place in April and May.
    (c) A county board whose powers are transferred to the special board of equalization under this
subdivision may be reinstated by resolution of the county board and upon proof of compliance with
the requirements of subdivision 2. The resolution and proofs must be provided to the commissioner

by December 1 in order to be effective for the following year's assessment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. In the case of taxing
authorities required to hold a public meeting under subdivision 6, the notice must clearly state that
each taxing authority, including regional library districts established under section 134.201, and
including the metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), but excluding all other special
taxing districts and towns, will hold a public meeting to receive public testimony on the proposed
budget and proposed or final property tax levy, or, in case of a school district, on the current budget
and proposed property tax levy. It must clearly state the time and place of each taxing authority's
meeting, a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions
related to the notice, and an address where comments will be received by mail.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
65TH DAY]                           WEDNESDAY, MAY 9, 2007                                         3887

amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for the Minneapolis
Library Board and the levy for Minneapolis Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St.
Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under section 134.07 may be listed separately from the
remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal
disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured
value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity subject to the areawide tax must each be stated
separately and not included in the sum of the special taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
3888                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [65TH DAY

   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

included with the appropriate county's levy and shall be discussed at that county's public hearing.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include

as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;
   (3) state or federal government action; and

   Sec. 49. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290C.05, is amended to read:
   290C.05 ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.
    On or before July 1 of each year, beginning with the year after the original claimant has received
an approved application, the commissioner shall send each claimant enrolled under the sustainable
forest incentive program a certification form. For purposes of this section, the original claimant is the
person that filed the first application under section 290C.04 to enroll the land in the program. The
claimant must sign the certification, attesting that the requirements and conditions for continued
enrollment in the program are currently being met, and must return the signed certification form
to the commissioner by August 15 of that same year. If the claimant does not return an annual
certification form by the due date, the provisions in section 290C.11 apply.

    (b) If the commissioner determines the land is to be removed from the sustainable forest incentive
program, the claimant is liable for payment to the commissioner in the amount equal to the payments
received under this chapter for the previous four-year period, plus interest. The claimant has 90 days
to satisfy the payment for removal of land from the sustainable forest incentive program under this

shall certify the amount to the county auditor for collection as a part of the general ad valorem real
property taxes on the land in the following taxes payable year.

      Sec. 51. [290C.13] APPEALS.
     Subdivision 1. Claimant right to reconsideration. A claimant may obtain reconsideration by
the commissioner of a determination removing enrolled land from the sustainable forest incentive
program, a determination denying an application to enroll land in the program, or a denial of part or
all of an incentive payment by filing an administrative appeal under subdivision 4. A claimant cannot
obtain reconsideration under this section if the action taken by the commissioner is the outcome of
an administrative appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeal by claimant. A claimant who wishes to seek administrative review must follow
the procedures in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 3. Notice date. For purposes of this section, the term "notice date" means the date of the
determination removing enrolled land or the date of the notice denying an application to enroll land
or denying part or all of an incentive payment.

claimant;
      (4) the date;
      (5) the periods involved and the amount of payment involved for each year or period;
      (6) the findings in the notice that the claimant disputes;

      (8) the claimant's signature or signature of the claimant's duly authorized agent.
   Subd. 5. Extensions. When requested in writing and within the time allowed for filing an
administrative appeal, the commissioner may extend the time for filing an appeal for a period not
more than 30 days from the expiration of the 60 days from the notice date.
    Subd. 6. Determination of appeal. On the basis of applicable law and available information,
the commissioner shall determine the validity, if any, in whole or in part, of the appeal and notify the
claimant of the decision. This notice must be in writing and contain the basis for the determination.
    Subd. 7. Agreement determining issues under appeal. When it appears to be in the best
interests of the state, the commissioner may settle the amount of any incentive payments,
payments owed by the claimant under section 290C.11, paragraph (b), penalties, or interest that
the commissioner has under consideration by virtue of an appeal filed under this section. An
agreement must be in writing and signed by the commissioner and the claimant, or the claimant's
representative authorized by the claimant to enter into an agreement. The agreement is final and
conclusive and, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material
fact, the case must not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon.
     Subd. 8. Appeal to Tax Court. Within 60 days after the commissioner denies an appeal, or
within 120 days after the commissioner received a written appeal if the commissioner has not made
a determination in that time, the claimant may appeal to Tax Court under chapter 271 as if the appeal
is from an order of the commissioner.
      Subd. 9. Exemption from Administrative Procedure Act. This section is not subject to chapter
14.

is not a collection agency as defined by section 332.31, subdivision 3, and is not licensed, bonded,
or regulated by the commissioner of commerce under sections 332.31 to 332.35 or 332.38 to
332.45. The commissioner is subject to section 332.37, except clause (9), (10), (12), or (19). Debts
referred to the commissioner for collection under section 256.9792 may in turn be referred by the
commissioner to the enterprise. An audited financial statement may not be required as a condition
of debt placement with a private agency if the private agency: (1) has errors and omissions coverage
under a professional liability policy in an amount of at least $1,000,000; or (2) has a fidelity bond to
cover actions of its employees, in an amount of at least $100,000. In cases of debts referred under
section 256.9792, the provisions of this chapter and section 256.9792 apply to the extent they are
not in conflict. If they are in conflict, the provisions of section 256.9792 control. For purposes of
this chapter, the referring agency for such debts remains the Department of Human Services.

    Sec. 15. Beginning July 1, 2009, until June 30, 2034, the sales and use tax rate shall be increased
by three-eighths of one percent on sales and uses taxable under the general state sales and use tax law.
Receipts from the increase, plus penalties and interest and reduced by any refunds, are dedicated as
follows: 33 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in the heritage enhancement fund and may be
spent only to preserve, enhance, or protect the state's fish, wildlife, habitat, land, and forest resources;
43 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in the great outdoors Minnesota fund and may be spent
only on protection and restoration of the state's lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands, groundwater, parks,
trails, natural areas, and historic sites; and 24 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in the cultural
legacy fund and may be spent only on arts, arts education, and arts access. A cultural legacy fund;
a heritage enhancement fund; and a great outdoors Minnesota fund are created in the state treasury.
The money dedicated under this section shall be appropriated by law. The money dedicated under
this section shall not be used as a substitute for traditional funding sources for the purposes specified,
but the dedicated money shall supplement traditional sources of funding for those purposes. Land
acquired by fee with money deposited in the heritage enhancement fund under this section must be
open to public taking of fish and game during the open season unless otherwise provided by law. If
the base of the sales and use tax is changed, the legislature may proportionally adjust the sales and
use tax rate in this section to within one-tenth of one percent in order to provide the same amount
of revenue as practicable for each fund as existed before the change to the sales and use tax.
