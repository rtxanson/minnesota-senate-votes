directed to study and make recommendations to the legislature on establishing, relocating, or closing

enterprise activity, the commissioner must obtain statutory authorization for its implementation,
relocation, or closing except that the commissioner has authority to implement enterprise activities

for adult mental health, adolescent services, and to establish a public group practice without statutory
authorization.
    (b) Enterprise activities are defined as the range of services, which are delivered by state
employees, needed by people with disabilities and are fully funded by public or private third-party
health insurance or other revenue sources available to clients that provide reimbursement for the
services provided. Enterprise activities within state-operated services shall specialize in caring for
vulnerable people for whom no other providers are available or for whom state-operated services
may be the provider selected by the payer.
    (c) In subsequent biennia after an enterprise activity is established within a state-operated
service, the base state appropriation for that state-operated service shall be reduced proportionate
to the size of the enterprise activity.
    (d) Any funds in a revolving account dedicated to any enterprise activity under section 246.18,
subdivision 6, are available to the commissioner to pay costs incurred by the commissioner in
relocating or closing that or any other enterprise activity.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 246.18, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Collections dedicated. Except for state-operated programs funded through a direct
appropriation from the legislature, any state-operated program or service established and operated
as an enterprise activity shall retain the revenues earned in an interest-bearing account.
    When the commissioner determines the intent to transition from a direct appropriation to
enterprise activity for which the commissioner has authority, all collections for the targeted
state-operated service shall be retained and deposited into an interest-bearing account. At the end
of the fiscal year, prior to establishing the enterprise activity, collections up to the amount of the
appropriation for the targeted service shall be deposited to the general fund. All funds in excess of
the amount of the appropriation w   ญญl
                                      iญl
                                        ญ must be retained and used (1) by the enterprise activity for
cash flow purposes, or (2) by the commissioner to pay any costs incurred by the commissioner in
relocating or closing an enterprise activity under section 246.0136, subdivision 1 paragraph (d).
   These funds must be deposited in the state treasury in a revolving account and funds in the
revolving account are appropriated to the commissioner to operate the services or pay the costs
authorized, and any unexpended balances do not cancel but are available until spent."
   Delete the title and insert:

development, environmental benefits to the state and region, efficient use of public transportation,
efficient use of existing infrastructure, provision of affordable housing, multiuse development
that constitutes community rebuilding rather than single-use development, crime reduction, blight
reduction, community stabilization, and property tax base maintenance or improvement. In making
this judgment, the commissioner shall give priority to redevelopment projects with one or more
of the following characteristics:
   (1) the need for redevelopment in conjunction with contamination remediation needs;
   (2) the redevelopment project meets current tax increment financing requirements for a
redevelopment district and tax increments will contribute to the project;
   (3) the redevelopment potential within the municipality;
   (4) proximity to public transit if located in the metropolitan area;
   (5) redevelopment costs related to expansion of a bioscience business in Minnesota; ญ

    (6) multijurisdictional projects that take into account the need for affordable housing,
transportation, and environmental impact; or
   (7) the project advances or promotes the green economy as defined in section 116J.437.
     (b) The factors in paragraph (a) are not listed in a rank order of priority; rather, the commissioner
may weigh each factor, depending upon the facts and circumstances, as the commissioner
considers appropriate. The commissioner may consider other factors that affect the net return of
public benefits for completion of the redevelopment plan. The commissioner, notwithstanding the
listing of priorities and the goal of maximizing the return of public benefits, shall make grants
that distribute available money to sites both within and outside of the metropolitan area. Unless
sufficient applications are not received for qualifying sites outside of the metropolitan area, at
least 50 percent of the money provided as grants must be made for sites located outside of the
metropolitan area.

  Sec. 10. [216C.43] ENERGY IMPROVEMENT FINANCING PROGRAM FOR LOCAL
GOVERNMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Commissioner's authority and duties; local government authority. The
commissioner shall administer this section. A local government may enter into contracts for the
purposes of this section with the commissioner, the primary contractor, other contracted technical
service providers, and participating financial institutions.
    Subd. 2. Program eligibility; voluntary program participation; targeted technical services.

targeted local governments to conduct energy project studies. The commissioner may contract with
one or more qualified technical service providers to conduct energy project studies for targeted local
governments. The commissioner may require full or partial reimbursement of costs for technical
services provided to a local government, subject to terms and conditions specified and agreed to by
contract before the delivery of technical services. A local government may independently procure
technical services to conduct an energy project study, but the energy project study must be reviewed
and approved by the commissioner to qualify an energy improvement project for a financing
agreement under subdivision 6 or a supplemental cash flow agreement under subdivision 7.
   Subd. 5. Participation of technical service providers statewide. Program activities must

                       MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS - CONTINUED

    Senate Resolution No. 176: A Senate resolution expressing the sense of the senate concerning
the establishment of an Autism Task Force.
   WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control, autism is the most common of the
Pervasive Developmental Disorders, affecting an estimated 1 in 150 births; and
    WHEREAS, roughly translated, this means as many as 1.5 million Americans today are believed
to have some form of autism, and this number is on the rise; and
    WHEREAS, autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first
three years of life and is the result of a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of
the brain, impacting the areas of social interaction and communication skills; and
118TH DAY]                         SATURDAY, MAY 17, 2008                                   10481

   WHEREAS, both children and adults with autism typically show difficulties in verbal and
nonverbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities; and
    WHEREAS, because autism is a spectrum disorder and, as a result, it affects each individual
differently and at varying degrees, early diagnosis is especially crucial; and
    WHEREAS, based on statistics from the United States Department of Education and other
governmental agencies, autism is growing at a startling rate of 10-17 percent per year, and at this
rate, the Autism Society of America (ASA) estimates that the prevalence of autism could reach 4
million Americans in the next decade; and
    WHEREAS, autism knows no racial, ethnic, social, income, lifestyle, or educational boundaries
and can affect any family and child; although the overall incidence of autism is consistent around
the world, it is in fact four times more prevalent in boys than in girls; NOW, THEREFORE,
    BE IT RESOLVED that it is the sense of the Senate of the State of Minnesota that an Autism Task
Force should be established to study and make recommendations to the legislature regarding the
growing incidence of autism and ways to improve the delivery and coordination of autism services
in the state.
   BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force should consist of 20 members:
    (a) four members of the legislature, including two members of the senate appointed by the
Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration, one of the majority
party and one of the minority party, and two members of the house of representatives appointed
by the speaker of the house of representatives, including one of the majority party and one of the
minority party;
   (b) three additional members appointed by the governor, who must include:
   (1) a representative of the Department of Health;
   (2) a representative of the Department of Human Services; and
   (3) a representative of the Department of Education; and
   (c) 11 additional members appointed by the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on
Rules and Administration and the speaker of the house of representatives, who must include:
   (1) four parents of children with autism;
   (2) a representative from the Autism Clinic at the University of Minnesota;
   (3) a representative of a local school district;
   (4) a representative of an autism therapy center;
   (5) a representative of the Autism Society of Minnesota;
   (6) a representative of a statewide advocacy group for persons with disabilities;
   (7) a representative of a county social services social worker; and
   (8) a representative of a county social services finance worker.

   BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force should:
   (1) appoint a chair from within its membership;
    (2) review the available literature and consult with experts to gain an understanding of the causes
of the disorder and its incidence in Minnesota;
    (3) assess the availability of services currently provided for early screening, diagnosis, and
treatment of the disorder;
   (4) assess the availability of services to assist families and individuals with autism;
    (5) review the effectiveness of programs and services provided to individuals with autism and
their families;
   (6) review other issues and concerns that the task force believes would be helpful in arriving at
sound policy recommendations; and
   (7) complete its review and submit its recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal
committees of the legislature and the governor by January 1, 2009.
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the task force should designate the Department of Education
as the lead agency in providing staff needed for the work of the task force. The department may seek
additional staff assistance from the Department of Health and staff from the health committees of
the legislature.

  Sec. 23. [94.3495] EXPEDITED EXCHANGES OF LAND INVOLVING THE STATE
AND GOVERNMENTAL SUBDIVISIONS OF THE STATE.
     Subdivision 1. Purpose and scope. (a) The purpose of this section is to expedite the exchange
118TH DAY]                          SATURDAY, MAY 17, 2008                                       10499

of public land ownership. Consolidation of public land reduces management costs and aids in the
reduction of forest fragmentation.
    (b) This section applies to exchanges of land between the state and a governmental subdivision
of the state. For land exchanges under this section, sections 94.342 to 94.347 apply only to the extent
specified in this section.
   Subd. 2. Classes of land; definitions. The classes of public land that may be involved in an
expedited exchange under this section are:
   (1) Class 1 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class A land as defined in section
94.342, subdivision 1, except for:
   (i) school trust land as defined in section 92.025; and
   (ii) university land granted to the state by acts of Congress;
   (2) Class 2 land, which for the purpose of this section is Class B land as defined in section 94.342,
subdivision 2; and
   (3) Class 3 land, which for the purpose of this section is all land owned in fee by a governmental
subdivision of the state.
     Subd. 3. Valuation of land. (a) In an exchange of Class 1 land for Class 2 or 3 land, the value of
all the land shall be determined by the commissioner of natural resources. In an exchange of Class 2
land for Class 3 land, the value of all the land shall be determined by the county board of the county
in which the land lies. To determine the value of the land, the parties to the exchange may cause the
land to be appraised, utilize the valuation process provided under section 84.0272, subdivision 3,
or obtain a market analysis from a qualified real estate broker. Merchantable timber value must be
determined and considered in finalizing valuation of the lands.
     (b) All lands exchanged under this section shall be exchanged only for lands of at least
substantially equal value. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantially equal value" has the
meaning given under section 94.343, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). No payment is due either party
if the lands are of substantially equal value but are not of the same value.
    Subd. 4. Title. Title to the land must be examined to the extent necessary for the parties to
determine that the title is good, with any encumbrances identified. The parties to the exchange may
utilize title insurance to aid in the determination.
    Subd. 5. Approval by Land Exchange Board. All expedited land exchanges under this
section, and the terms and conditions of the exchanges, require the unanimous approval of the
Land Exchange Board.
    Subd. 6. Conveyance. (a) Conveyance of Class 1 land given in exchange shall be made by deed
executed by the commissioner of natural resources in the name of the state. Conveyance of Class
2 land given in exchange shall be by a deed executed by the commissioner of revenue in the name
of the state. Conveyance of Class 3 land shall be by a deed executed by the governing body in the
name of the governing authority.
   (b) If Class 1 land is given in exchange for Class 2 or 3 land, the deed to the Class 2 or 3 land
shall first be delivered to the commissioner of natural resources. Following the recording of the
10500                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [118TH DAY

deed, the commissioner of natural resources shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 1 land.
    (c) If Class 2 land is given in exchange for Class 3 land, the deed to the Class 3 land shall first be
delivered to the county auditor. Following the recording of the deed, the commissioner of revenue
shall deliver the deed conveying the Class 2 land.
   (d) All deeds shall be recorded or registered in the county in which the lands lie.
    Subd. 7. Reversionary interest; mineral and water power rights and other reservations. (a)
All deeds conveying land given in an expedited land exchange under this section shall include a
reverter that provides that title to the land automatically reverts to the conveying governmental unit
if:
   (1) the receiving governmental unit sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers title of the land
within 40 years of the date of the deed conveying ownership; and
   (2) there is no prior written approval for the transfer from the conveying governmental unit. The
authority for granting approval is the commissioner of natural resources for former Class 1 land, the
county board for former Class 2 land, and the governing body for former Class 3 land.
    (b) Class 1 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section 94.343,
subdivision 4. Class 2 land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of section
94.344, subdivision 4. County fee land given in exchange is subject to the reservation provisions of
section 373.01, subdivision 1, paragraph (g).
    Subd. 8. Land status. Land received in exchange for Class 1 land is subject to the same trust,
if any, and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange
for Class 2 land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision wherein it lies and all
laws relating to tax-forfeited land. Land received in exchange for Class 3 land has the same status
as the land given in exchange.
   Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.055, subdivision 4b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4b. Citizen oversight subcommittees. (a) The commissioner shall appoint
subcommittees of affected persons to review the reports prepared under subdivision 4; review
the proposed work plans and budgets for the coming year; propose changes in policies,
activities, and revenue enhancements or reductions; review other relevant information; and make
recommendations to the legislature and the commissioner for improvements in the management
and use of money in the game and fish fund.
    (b) The commissioner shall appoint the following subcommittees, each comprised of at least
three affected persons:
    (1) a Fisheries Operations Subcommittee to review fisheries funding, excluding activities related
to trout and salmon stamp funding;

effectiveness of health care homes. Data collected under this subdivision is classified as nonpublic
data under chapter 13.
    Subd. 7. Outreach. Beginning July 1, 2009, the commissioner shall encourage state health care
program enrollees who have a complex or chronic condition to select a primary care clinic with
clinicians who have been certified as health care homes.
   Sec. 2. [256B.0752] HEALTH CARE HOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Annual reports on implementation and administration. The commissioners
shall report annually to the legislature on the implementation and administration of the health
care home model for state health care program enrollees in the fee-for-service, managed care, and
county-based purchasing sectors beginning December 15, 2009, and each December 15 thereafter.
   Subd. 2. Evaluation reports. The commissioners shall provide to the legislature comprehensive
evaluations of the health care home model three years and five years after implementation. The
report must include:
   (1) the number of state health care program enrollees in health care homes and the number and
characteristics of enrollees with complex or chronic conditions, identified by income, race, ethnicity,
and language;
   (2) the number and geographic distribution of health care home providers;
   (3) the performance and quality of care of health care homes;
   (4) measures of preventive care;
    (5) health care home payment arrangements, and costs related to implementation and payment
of care coordination fees;
   (6) the estimated impact of health care homes on health disparities; and
  (7) estimated savings from implementation of the health care home model for the fee-for-service,
managed care, and county-based purchasing sectors.
  Sec. 3. [256B.0753] PAYMENT RESTRUCTURING; CARE COORDINATION
PAYMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Development. The commissioner of human services, in coordination with the
commissioner of health, shall develop a payment system that provides per-person care coordination
payments to health care homes certified under section 256B.0751 for providing care coordination
services and directly managing on-site or employing care coordinators. The care coordination
payments under this section are in addition to the quality incentive payments in section 256B.0754,
subdivision 1. The care coordination payment system must vary the fees paid by thresholds of
care complexity, with the highest fees being paid for care provided to individuals requiring the
most intensive care coordination. In developing the criteria for care coordination payments, the
commissioner shall consider the feasibility of including the additional time and resources needed by
patients with limited English-language skills, cultural differences, or other barriers to health care.
The commissioner may determine a schedule for phasing in care coordination fees such that the
fees will be applied first to individuals who have, or are at risk of developing, complex or chronic
health conditions. Development of the payment system must be completed by January 1, 2010.
10520                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [118TH DAY

   Subd. 2. Implementation. The commissioner of human services shall implement care
coordination payments as specified under this section by July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later. For enrollees served under the fee-for-service system, the care coordination
payment shall be determined by the commissioner in contracts with certified health care homes. For
enrollees served by managed care or county-based purchasing plans, the commissioner's contracts
with these plans shall require the payment of care coordination fees to certified health care homes.
    Subd. 3. Cost neutrality. If initial savings from implementation of health care homes are
not sufficient to allow implementation of the care coordination fee in a cost-neutral manner, the
commissioner may make recommendations to the legislature on reallocating costs within the health
care system.
   Sec. 4. [256B.0754] PAYMENT REFORM.
    Subdivision 1. Quality incentive payments. By July 1, 2010, the commissioner of human
services shall implement quality incentive payments as established under section 62U.02 for all
enrollees in state health care programs consistent with relevant state and federal statute and rule.
This section does not limit the ability of the commissioner of human services to establish by
contract and monitor, as part of its quality assurance obligations for state health care programs,
outcome and performance measures for nonmedical services and health issues likely to occur in
low-income populations or racial or cultural groups disproportionately represented in state health
care program enrollment that would likely be underrepresented when using traditional measures
that are based on longer-term enrollment.
    Subd. 2. Payment reform. By January 1, 2011, the commissioner of human services shall use
the information and methods developed under section 62U.04 to establish a payment system that:
   (1) rewards high-quality, low-cost providers;
   (2) creates enrollee incentives to receive care from high-quality, low-cost providers; and
   (3) fosters collaboration among providers to reduce cost shifting from one part of the health
continuum to another.
   Sec. 5. WORKFORCE SHORTAGE STUDY.
    To address health care workforce shortages, the commissioner of health, in consultation with
the health licensing boards and professional associations, shall study changes necessary in health
professional licensure and regulation to ensure full utilization of advanced practice registered nurses,
physician assistants, and other licensed health care professionals in the health care home and primary
delivery system. The commissioner shall make recommendations to the legislature by January 15,
2009.

    (b) Pursuant to United States Code, title 42, section 1758(b)(6)(A), the Department of Education
shall enter into an agreement with the Department of Human Services to share the eligibility
information provided by each school in paragraph (a) for the limited purpose of identifying children

an incentive program for organizations and licensed insurance producers under chapter 60K that
directly identify and assist potential enrollees in filling out and submitting an application. For each
applicant who is successfully enrolled in MinnesotaCare, medical assistance, or general assistance
medical care, the commissioner, within the available appropriation, shall pay the organization or
licensed insurance producer a $  ญ2

read:
    Subdivision 1. Families with children. (a) Families with children with family income equal
to or less than 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size shall be
eligible for MinnesotaCare according to this section. All other provisions of sections 256L.01 to
256L.18, including the insurance-related barriers to enrollment under section 256L.07, shall apply
unless otherwise specified.
    (b) Parents who enroll in the MinnesotaCare program must also enroll their children, if the
children are eligible. Children may be enrolled separately without enrollment by parents. However,
if one parent in the household enrolls, both parents must enroll, unless other insurance is available. If
one child from a family is enrolled, all children must be enrolled, unless other insurance is available.
If one spouse in a household enrolls, the other spouse in the household must also enroll, unless other
insurance is available. Families cannot choose to enroll only certain uninsured members.
   (c) Beginning October 1, 2003, the dependent sibling definition no longer applies to the
MinnesotaCare program. These persons are no longer counted in the parental household and may
apply as a separate household.
    (d) Beginning July 1, 2003, or upon federal approval, whichever is later, parents are not eligible
for MinnesotaCare if their gross income exceeds ญ $5

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.05, subdivision 3a, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 3a. Renewal of eligibility. (a) Beginning July 1, 2007, an enrollee's eligibility must be
renewed every 12 months. The 12-month period begins in the month after the month the application
is approved.
    (b) Each new period of eligibility must take into account any changes in circumstances that
impact eligibility and premium amount. An enrollee must provide all the information needed to
redetermine eligibility by the first day of the month that ends the eligibility period. If there is no
change in circumstances, the enrollee may renew eligibility at designated locations that include
community clinics and health care providers' offices. The designated sites shall forward the renewal
forms to the commissioner. The commissioner may establish criteria and timelines for sites to
forward applications to the commissioner or county agencies. The premium for the new period of
eligibility must be received as provided in section 256L.06 in order for eligibility to continue.
    (c) For single adults and households with no children formerly enrolled in general assistance
medical care and enrolled in MinnesotaCare according to section 256D.03, subdivision 3, the first
period of eligibility begins the month the enrollee submitted the application or renewal for general
assistance medical care.
    (d) An enrollee who fails to submit renewal forms and related documentation necessary for
verification of continued eligibility in a timely manner shall remain eligible for one additional month
beyond the end of the current eligibility period before being disenrolled. The enrollee remains
responsible for MinnesotaCare premiums for the additional month.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009, or upon federal approval,
whichever is later. The commissioner of human services shall notify the revisor of statutes when
federal approval is obtained.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.06, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Commissioner's duties and payment. (a) Premiums are dedicated to the commissioner
for MinnesotaCare.
    (b) The commissioner shall develop and implement procedures to: (1) require enrollees to report
changes in income; (2) adjust sliding scale premium payments, based upon both increases and
decreases in enrollee income, at the time the change in income is reported; and (3) disenroll enrollees
from MinnesotaCare for failure to pay required premiums. Failure to pay includes payment with
a dishonored check, a returned automatic bank withdrawal, or a refused credit card or debit card
payment. The commissioner may demand a guaranteed form of payment, including a cashier's check
or a money order, as the only means to replace a dishonored, returned, or refused payment.
    (c) Premiums are calculated on a calendar month basis and may be paid on a monthly, quarterly,
or semiannual basis, with the first payment due upon notice from the commissioner of the premium
amount required. The commissioner shall inform applicants and enrollees of these premium payment
options. Premium payment is required before enrollment is complete and to maintain eligibility

to persons disenrolled for nonpayment who reapply under section 256L.05, subdivision 3b. Persons
disenrolled for nonpayment or who voluntarily terminate coverage from the program may not
reenroll for four calendar months unless the person demonstrates good cause for nonpayment.
Good cause does not exist if a person chooses to pay other family expenses instead of the premium.
The commissioner shall define good cause in rule.

   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.07, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. General requirements. (a) Children enrolled in the original children's health
plan as of September 30, 1992, children who enrolled in the MinnesotaCare program after
September 30, 1992, pursuant to Laws 1992, chapter 549, article 4, section 17, and children who
have family gross incomes that are equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines
are eligible without meeting the requirements of subdivision 2 and the four-month requirement
in subdivision 3, as long as they maintain continuous coverage in the MinnesotaCare program or
medical assistance. Children who apply for MinnesotaCare on or after the implementation date of
the employer-subsidized health coverage program as described in Laws 1998, chapter 407, article
5, section 45, who have family gross incomes that are equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal
poverty guidelines, must meet the requirements of subdivision 2 to be eligible for MinnesotaCare.
    Families enrolled in MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 1, whose income
increases above 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, are no longer eligible for the program
and shall be disenrolled by the commissioner. Beginning January 1, 2008, individuals enrolled in
MinnesotaCare under section 256L.04, subdivision 7, whose income increases above 200 percent
of the federal poverty guidelines or ญ21

July 1, 2009, are no longer eligible for the program and shall be disenrolled by the commissioner.
For persons disenrolled under this subdivision, MinnesotaCare coverage terminates the last day of
the calendar month following the month in which the commissioner determines that the income of
a family or individual exceeds program income limits.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), children may remain enrolled in MinnesotaCare if ten percent
of their gross individual or gross family income as defined in section 256L.01, subdivision 4, is
less than the annual premium for a policy with a $500 deductible available through the Minnesota
Comprehensive Health Association. Children who are no longer eligible for MinnesotaCare under
this clause shall be given a 12-month notice period from the date that ineligibility is determined

before disenrollment. The premium for children remaining eligible under this clause shall be the
maximum premium determined under section 256L.15, subdivision 2, paragraph (b).

or upon federal approval, whichever is later. The effective date for the amendment to paragraph (c)
is July 1, 2010, or upon federal approval, whichever is later. The commissioner of human services
shall notify the revisor of statutes when federal approval is obtained.
   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 2. Sliding fee scale; monthly gross individual or family income. (a) The commissioner
shall establish a sliding fee scale to determine the percentage of monthly gross individual or
family income that households at different income levels must pay to obtain coverage through
the MinnesotaCare program. The sliding fee scale must be based on the enrollee's monthly gross
individual or family income. The sliding fee scale must contain separate tables based on enrollment
of one, two, or three or more persons. Until June 30, 2009, the sliding fee scale begins with a
premium of 1.5 percent of monthly gross individual or family income for individuals or families
with incomes below the limits for the medical assistance program for families and children in
effect on January 1, 1999, and proceeds through the following evenly spaced steps: 1.8, 2.3, 3.1,
3.8, 4.8, 5.9, 7.4, and 8.8 percent. These percentages are matched to evenly spaced income steps
ranging from the medical assistance income limit for families and children in effect on January 1,
1999, to 275 percent of the federal poverty guidelines for the applicable family size, up to a family
size of five. The sliding fee scale for a family of five must be used for families of more than five.
The sliding fee scale and percentages are not subject to the provisions of chapter 14. If a family or
individual reports increased income after enrollment, premiums shall be adjusted at the time the
change in income is reported.

                ญญ
                 s Children in families whose gross income is above 275 percent of the federal poverty
guidelines shall pay the maximum premium. The maximum premium is defined as a base charge for
one, two, or three or more enrollees so that if all MinnesotaCare cases paid the maximum premium,
the total revenue would equal the total cost of MinnesotaCare medical coverage and administration.
In this calculation, administrative costs shall be assumed to equal ten percent of the total. The costs
of medical coverage for pregnant women and children under age two and the enrollees in these
groups shall be excluded from the total. The maximum premium for two enrollees shall be twice the
maximum premium for one, and the maximum premium for three or more enrollees shall be three
times the maximum premium for one.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2009, MinnesotaCare enrollees shall pay premiums according to the
premium scale specified in paragraph (d) with the exception that children in families with income
at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines shall pay a monthly premium of $4. For
purposes of paragraph (d), "minimum" means a monthly premium of $4.
   (d) The following premium scale is established for individuals and families with gross family
incomes of 300 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or less:

whichever is later. The commissioner of human services shall notify the revisor of statutes when
federal approval is obtained.
  Sec. 12. AUTOMATION AND COORDINATION FOR STATE HEALTH CARE
PROGRAMS.
   (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "state health care program" means the medical assistance,
MinnesotaCare, or general assistance medical care programs.
    (b) By January 15, 2009, the commissioner of human services shall report to the legislature
on ways to improve coordination between state health care programs and social service programs,
including, but not limited to, WIC and food stamps. This report must include a review of options for
the development of automated systems to identify persons served by social service programs who
may be eligible for, but are not enrolled in, a state health care program. The report shall identify to the
legislature statutory changes to state health care and social service programs necessary to improve
coordination and automation between state health care programs and social service programs.
   Sec. 13. LONG-TERM CARE WORKER HEALTH COVERAGE STUDY.
    (a) The commissioner of human services shall study and report to the legislature by December
15, 2008, with recommendations for a rate increase to long-term care employers dedicated to
the purchase of employee health insurance in the private market. The commissioner shall collect
necessary actuarial data, employment data, current coverage data, and other needed information.
   (b) The commissioner shall develop cost estimates for three levels of insurance coverage for
long-term care workers:
   (1) the coverage provided to state employees;
   (2) the coverage provided to MinnesotaCare enrollees; and
   (3) the benefits provided under an "average" private market insurance product, but with a

deductible limited to $100 per person.
    Premium cost sharing, waiting periods for eligibility, definitions of full- and part-time
employment, and other parameters under the three options must be identical to those under the
state employees health plan.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a long-term care worker is a person employed by a nursing
facility, an intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities, or a service
provider that:
   (1) is eligible under Laws 2007, chapter 147, article 7, section 71; and
   (2) provides long-term care services.
    The commissioner may recommend a different definition of long-term care worker if this
definition presents insurmountable implementation issues.
   (d) The recommendations must include measures to:
   (1) ensure equitable treatment between employers that currently have different levels of
expenditure for employee health insurance costs; and
   (2) enforce the requirement that the rate increase be expended for the intended purpose.
   Sec. 14. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256L.15, subdivision 3, is repealed.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2009, or upon federal approval of
the amendments to Minnesota Statutes, section 256L.15, subdivision 2, paragraphs (c) and (d),

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 43A.23, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. General. (a) The commissioner is authorized to request proposals or to negotiate
and to enter into contracts with parties which in the judgment of the commissioner are best qualified
to provide service to the benefit plans. Contracts entered into are not subject to the requirements of
sections 16C.16 to 16C.19. The commissioner may negotiate premium rates and coverage. The
commissioner shall consider the cost of the plans, conversion options relating to the contracts,
service capabilities, character, financial position, and reputation of the carriers, and any other factors
which the commissioner deems appropriate. Each benefit contract must be for a uniform term of
at least one year, but may be made automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of
notice of termination by either party. A carrier licensed under chapter 62A is exempt from the taxes
imposed by chapter 297I on premiums paid to it by the state.
  (b) All self-insured hospital and medical service products must comply with coverage
mandates, data reporting, and consumer protection requirements applicable to the licensed carrier

administering the product, had the product been insured, including chapters 62J, 62M, and 62Q.
Any self-insured products that limit coverage to a network of providers or provide different levels
of coverage between network and nonnetwork providers shall comply with section 62D.123 and
geographic access standards for health maintenance organizations adopted by the commissioner of
health in rule under chapter 62D.
    (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), a self-insured hospital and medical product offered under
sections 43A.22 to 43A.30 is not required to extend dependent coverage to an eligible employee's
unmarried child under the age of 25 to the full extent required under chapters 62A and 62L.
Dependent coverage must, at a minimum, extend to an eligible employee's unmarried child who
is under the age of 19 or an unmarried child under the age of 25 who is a full-time student. The
definition of "full-time student" for purposes of this paragraph includes any student who by reason
of illness, injury, or physical or mental disability as documented by a physician is unable to carry
what the educational institution considers a full-time course load so long as the student's course
load is at least 60 percent of what otherwise is considered by the institution to be a full-time course
load. Any notice regarding termination of coverage due to attainment of the limiting age must
include information about this definition of "full-time student."
    (d) Beginning January 1, 2010, the health insurance benefit plans offered in the commissioner's
plan under section 43A.18, subdivision 2, and the managerial plan under section 43A.18, subdivision
3, must include an option for a health plan that is compatible with the definition of a high-deductible
health plan in section 223 of the United States Internal Revenue Code.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 62J.495, is amended by adding a
subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3. Interoperable electronic health record requirements. (a) To meet the requirements
of subdivision 1, hospitals and health care providers must meet the following criteria when
implementing an interoperable electronic health records system within their hospital system or

    (b) The electronic health record must be certified by the Certification Commission for Healthcare
Information Technology, or its successor. This criterion only applies to hospitals and health care
providers whose practice setting is a practice setting covered by Certification Commission for
Healthcare Information Technology certifications. This criterion shall be considered met if a
hospital or health care provider is using an electronic health records system that has been certified
within the last three years, even if a more current version of the system has been certified within
the three-year period.
    (c) A health care provider who is a prescriber or dispenser of controlled substances must have
an electronic health record system that meets the requirements of section 62J.497.

    (c) Providers, group purchasers, prescribers, and dispensers must use either HL7 messages
or the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard to transmit prescriptions or prescription-related information

section 256B.0751. Health plan companies shall develop payment conditions and terms for the care
coordination fee for health care homes participating in their network in a manner that is consistent
with the system developed under section 256B.0753. Nothing in this section shall restrict the ability
of health plan companies to selectively contract with health care providers, including health care
homes. Health plan companies may reduce or reallocate payments to other providers to ensure that
implementation of care coordination payments is cost neutral.
    (b) By July 1, 2010, the commissioner of finance shall implement the care coordination payments
for participants in the state employee group insurance program. The commissioner of finance may
reallocate payments within the health care system in order to ensure that the implementation of this
