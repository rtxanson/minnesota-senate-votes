other compensation from a collateral source, the individual shall notify the health care provider
and provide information identifying the collateral source, the nature and extent of coverage or
entitlement, and other relevant information. The health care provider shall forward this information

contractual retiree health benefits provided by employers as other contracts, allowing the Minnesota
Health Plan to recover the cost of services provided to individuals covered by the retiree benefits,

Health Plan.

payment of any tax or other obligation imposed by this chapter shall result in the remedies and
