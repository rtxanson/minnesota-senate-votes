81ST DAY]                       THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2008                                        6613

where the wireless carrier's wireless telecommunications service is offered for sale and make those
maps available electronically at the carrier's Web site;
    (3) clearly and conspicuously disclose at the time of sale the price for the service being purchased
by the customer, including the monthly access fee or base charge, the amount of any activation or
initiation fee, any charges for domestic roaming, any charge for domestic long distance, any charge
for exceeding the number of minutes or usage included in any allowance, and any other charges
collected and retained by the carrier and disclose a good faith estimate of the amount or range of all
applicable government-mandated or authorized charges and taxes;
    (4) clearly and conspicuously disclose to the customer at the time of sale, in at least 12-point font
in written materials: (i) that the price is not guaranteed to remain the same for the minimum term
of the contract if a contract provision allows the wireless carrier to change the price of the service
during the minimum term, and (ii) any early termination fee that applies if service is terminated
during the minimum term; and
    (5) prior to the execution of a contract for wireless telephone service, provide the customer the
terms of the contract, and after execution of the contract provide the customer with a copy of the
writing or writings constituting the contract, at the time of sale and thereafter upon the customer's
request.
    (b) With regard to any early termination fee provisions or provisions allowing the wireless carrier
to change the price of the service during the minimum contract term, the wireless carrier must
obtain a specific acknowledgment from the customer that the customer has read and understands
the provisions.
    Subd. 3. Billing; listing of government taxes and fees. All bills for wireless
telecommunications services must list government-mandated charges and taxes in a section
of the bill separate from the section or sections listing the price and any other charges for the
wireless telecommunications service. The wireless carrier must include a brief, easy-to-understand
description of each charge included in the bill. The wireless carrier must not represent, expressly
or by implication, that discretionary cost recovery fees or charges are government-mandated
charges and taxes.
    Subd. 4. Billing for third-party goods and services. (a) A wireless carrier must not include on
a customer's bill a charge for goods or services that the carrier bills on behalf of a third party unless
the third party or wireless carrier has obtained the customer's prior express authorization to include
those charges on the customer's bill issued by the wireless carrier.
    (b) If a customer of a wireless carrier disputes any third-party charge appearing on that customer's
wireless bill, the customer shall not be obligated to pay the disputed charge until the wireless carrier
or third party provides evidence of the customer's prior express authorization to include such charge.
Evidence of the customer's prior express authorization must be produced to the customer within 14
calendar days after the customer notifies the wireless carrier that the charge is disputed. A customer
shall be permitted to dispute any charges that a wireless carrier bills on behalf of a third party for up
to six months after the charge appears on the customer's wireless bill. If the wireless carrier cannot
produce evidence that the customer authorized the third-party charge, the wireless carrier must
remove the charge from the customer's wireless bill and credit the customer for the unauthorized
third-party charges incurred during the previous six months.
6614                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [81ST DAY

   (c) A wireless carrier or third party meets the prior express authorization requirements of this
subdivision only if it obtains or receives:
   (1) written authorization from the customer containing clear, unambiguous, and separate
authorizations for each third-party good or service to be included on the customer's bill;
   (2) a customer's oral authorization if the customer subsequently opts in by an e-mail or text
message exchange with the third party or wireless carrier; or
    (3) a customer's affirmative authorization via an interactive voice response system or via an
electronic communication, such as through the Internet, by e-mail, or by text message, if the
customer subsequently opts in by e-mail or by text message.
    (d) For direct-dialed calls, where the call itself represents the service for which the charge is
placed on a customer's wireless telephone bill, evidence that the call was placed from the number
that is subject to the wireless telephone bill is sufficient evidence of authorization for that call for
billing authorization purposes established in this subdivision. Nothing in this subdivision may be
construed to change obligations or affect rights under section 325F.692.
   (e) This subdivision does not apply to charges for collect calls.
    (f) All wireless carriers must provide a means by which customers may restrict access to
third-party charges on the customer's wireless bill.
    (g) Nothing in this subdivision restricts the right of a wireless carrier to seek to recover from a
third party unauthorized charges credited to the customer by the wireless carrier.
    Subd. 5. Extensions in contract length. (a) If a customer is offered, accepts, or requests a good,
service, or promotion or changes the customer's wireless service plan in any manner, and this good,
service, promotion, or change will result in the extension of the minimum contract term or create a
new contract with a minimum term, the wireless carrier must disclose to the customer at the point
of sale or acceptance that the requested good, service, promotion, or change will result in a contract
extension or creation of a new contract with a minimum term, and must further disclose the length
of the extension or new term.
    (b) If the customer and a representative of the carrier are personally present at the point of
sale or acceptance, the wireless provider must also in connection with the new good, service,
promotion, or change obtain the customer's signed consent in an independent document. The
independent document must only include the terms set forth in clauses (1) to (3) and must clearly
and conspicuously disclose in at least 14-point font:
    (1) that the new good, service, promotion, or change will result in an extension or renewal of
the customer's contract;
   (2) the new contract start and end dates; and
    (3) that failure to complete the new contract term may result in early termination fees and, if so,
the amount of the fees.
     (c) If the customer's consent is obtained via the Internet, the wireless provider must disclose in
at least 14-point font the terms listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3). The customer must provide
a valid electronic signature showing that the wireless provider has disclosed and the customer has

agreed to the extension or renewal of the contract. An electronic record must be available upon
request to the customer until the new contract term expires.
    (d) If the customer's consent is obtained orally, the wireless provider must clearly disclose the
terms listed in paragraph (b), clauses (1) to (3), and the customer's consent to each term must be
recorded and retained by the provider and be made available upon request to the customer until the
new contract term expires.
   (e) Within ten days after a customer's contract has been extended or renewed, the wireless service
provider must notify the customer in an independent writing that the contract has been extended or
renewed. The independent writing must only include the terms set forth in clauses (1) to (3) and
must clearly and conspicuously disclose in at least 14-point font:
    (1) that the new good, service, promotion, or change will result in an extension or renewal of
the customer's contract;
   (2) the new contract start and end dates; and
    (3) that failure to complete the new contract term may result in early termination fees and, if so,
the amount of the fees.
    (f) Failure of the provider to make any of the disclosures or to obtain any of the consents required
in this subdivision voids any contract extension covered by this subdivision.
    Subd. 6. Consumer remedies may not be limited. A wireless carrier may not limit by contract
the right of a subscriber to bring complaints or the rights and remedies available to a subscriber
by law, including class actions, in any state or federal court or agency of competent jurisdiction.
A wireless carrier may not by contract hold subscribers liable for carrier legal costs resulting from
complaints before the commission, the courts, or another agency. A contract between a wireless
carrier and a customer may not require that disputes under the contract be submitted to arbitration.
    Subd. 7. Remedies; penalties, enforcement. A violation of this section is a violation of a law
referred to in section 8.31, subdivision 1.
    Subd. 8. Severability. Each of the provisions of this section, and each application of a provision
to particular circumstances, is severable. If a provision or application is found to be contrary to law
and unenforceable, it is the intention of the legislature that the remaining provisions and applications
of this section remain valid and enforceable to the full extent possible under section 645.20.
   Sec. 2. REPEALER.
   Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325F.695, is repealed.

attributable to:
    (1) that portion of the gasoline excise tax rate under section 296A.07, subdivision 3, in excess of
20 cents per gallon, and to that portion of the excise tax rates in excess of the energy equivalent of a
gasoline excise tax rate of 20 cents per gallon for E85 and M85 under section 296A.07, subdivision
3, and special fuel under section 296A.08, subdivision 2; and
    (2) a change in the passenger vehicle registration tax under section 168.013, imposed on or after
July 1, 2008, that exceeds (i) the amount collected in fiscal year 2008, multiplied by (ii) the annual
average United States Consumer Price Index for the calendar year previous to the current calendar
year, divided by the annual average United States Consumer Price Index for calendar year 2007, in
the previous fiscal year.
   Subd. 2. Agency budgets. The commissioner of finance shall calculate the total general fund
budgets of all state agencies, excluding the Department of Transportation, for the previous fiscal
year. Of that total, the commissioner shall calculate each agency proportional share so that when all
agency proportional shares are added together, they total the amount calculated under subdivision 1.

   Subd. 3. Budget reductions. On or before August 1, the commissioner of finance shall inform
each state agency commissioner, excluding the commissioner of transportation, the amount of that
agency's proportional share under subdivision 2. Each agency commissioner shall reduce its fiscal
year budgeted general fund appropriations in an amount equal to the agency's proportional share,
and shall report the reductions to the commissioners of finance and revenue.
    Subd. 4. Income tax rebate. The commissioner of revenue shall design an annual rebate program
to rebate to the state's taxpayers on an annual basis, a total amount equal to the total calculated under
subdivision 1. An individual taxpayer who has attained the age of 18 by the end of the taxable year
and cannot be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return is eligible to receive a rebate
program.
   Subd. 5. Appropriation. An amount sufficient to pay the rebate under subdivision 4 is annually
appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue."

commissioner may disregard a fractional part of a dollar unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in
which case it may be increased to $1.

   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.06, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 2g. Adjustment of rate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007, when the
gasoline excise tax in section 296A.07, subdivision 3, clause (3), is imposed at a rate of 25 cents
a gallon, the commissioner must first calculate the percentage adjustment of the brackets from the
base year to the current taxable year in the manner provided in subdivision 2d. The commissioner
must calculate the revenues raised from five cents of the gasoline excise tax in section 296A.07,
subdivision 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions 2c and 2d, the commissioner must
reduce the rate percentage of the lowest rate bracket so that the net impact on tax collections of
the combination of five cents imposition of the gasoline excise tax and this rate adjustment is zero.
The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a "rule" and is not subject
to the Administrative Procedure Act in chapter 14. No later than December 15 of each year, the
commissioner must announce the rate percentage that is applicable for the lowest bracket under this
subdivision.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2007. This section expires the day after the commissioner of finance reports to the commissioner
of revenue that the amount of the trunk highway debt service transfer forecast in the next two fiscal
years attributable to the trunk highway bonds authorized in article 2 is zero."

treasury as follows:
    (1) 50 percent of the receipts must be deposited in the heritage enhancement account in the game
