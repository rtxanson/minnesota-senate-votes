extent they become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-307; ­         an

interest in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985

property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate
as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who

spouses, if any, to sign all documents, take all actions, and otherwise fully cooperate with the
personal representative and the court to liquidate the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interests
in the estate and deliver the cash or the proceeds of those interests to the personal representative
and provide for any legal and equitable sanctions as the court deems appropriate to enforce and
carry out the order, including an award of reasonable attorney fees.
    (e) The personal representative may make, execute, and deliver any conveyances or other
documents necessary to convey the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the estate that
are necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash the decedent's interest or for any other purposes.
    (f) Subject to administration, all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, directly and
immediately related to liquidating the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the decedent's
estate, shall be paid from the gross proceeds of the liquidation allocable to the decedent's interest
and the net proceeds shall be turned over to the personal representative and applied to payment of
the claim presented under this section.
    (g) The personal representative shall bring a motion in the district court in which the estate is
being probated to compel the remaindermen or surviving joint tenants to account for and deliver
to the personal representative all or any part of the proceeds of any sale, mortgage, transfer,
conveyance, or any disposition of real property allocable to the decedent's life estate or joint
tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash
the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal
representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to,
ordering a partition of real estate under chapter 558 necessary to make the value of the decedent's
life estate or joint tenancy interest available to the estate for payment of a claim under this section.
    (h) Subject to administration, the personal representative shall use all of the cash or proceeds of
interests to pay an allowable claim under this section. The remaindermen or surviving joint tenants
and their spouses, if any, may enter into a written agreement with the personal representative or the
claimant to settle and satisfy obligations imposed at any time before or after a claim is filed.
    (i) The personal representative may, at their discretion, provide any or all of the other owners,
remaindermen, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's estate's
interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others, if the
personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the decedent's
predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this
section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the estate has other
assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement under paragraph (h),
or if the claim, as allowed, has been paid in full or to the full extent of the assets the estate has
available to pay it. The affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county recorder or filed in
the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is located. Except as
provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit shall terminate the
decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant with others.
The affidavit shall: (1) be signed by the personal representative; (2) identify the decedent and the
interest being terminated; (3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that
created the interest in real property being terminated; (4) legally describe the affected real property;
(5) state that the personal representative has determined that neither the decedent nor any of the
decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed

under this section; (6) state that the decedent's estate has other assets sufficient to pay the claim, as
presented, or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant
and the other owners or remaindermen or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed
under this subdivision; and (7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest
under this subdivision, and any other contents as may be appropriate.
The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall
be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording
information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall
be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.
   (j) The holder of a lien arising under subdivision 1c shall release the lien at the holder's expense
against an interest terminated under paragraph (h) to the extent of the termination.
    (k) If a lien arising under subdivision 1c is not released under paragraph (j), prior to closing the
estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remaindermen or
surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work
a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder
interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the
property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.15, subdivision 1i, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1i. Estates of persons receiving medical assistance and survived by others. (a) For
purposes of this subdivision, the person's estate consists of the person's probate estate and all of the
person's interests in real property the person owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant at the time of the
person's death and the person's legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property
transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds
from the subsequent sale of the person's interest in the transferred real property.
    (b) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, this subdivision applies if a person received
medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section but for the fact the person was
survived by a spouse or by a person listed in subdivision 3, or if subdivision 4 applies to a claim
arising under this section.
    (c) The person's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property not subject to a medical
assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985 on the date of the person's death shall not end
upon death and shall continue as provided in this subdivision. The life estate in the estate shall be
the portion of the interest in the property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate
percentage factor for the life estate as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care
program's manual for a person who was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of
the person's death. The joint tenancy interest in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest
the medical assistance recipient would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had
they and the other owners held title to the property as tenants in common on the date the medical
assistance recipient died.
    (d) The county agency shall file a claim in the estate under this section on behalf of the claimant
who shall be the commissioner of human services, notwithstanding that the decedent is survived by
a spouse or a person listed in subdivision 3. The claim, as allowed, shall not be paid by the estate
and shall be disposed of as provided in this paragraph. The personal representative or the court shall

make, execute, and deliver a lien in favor of the claimant on the decedent's interest in real property in
the estate in the amount of the allowed claim on forms provided by the commissioner to the county
agency filing the lien. The lien shall bear interest as provided under section 524.3-806, shall attach
to the property it describes upon filing or recording, and shall remain a lien on the real property it
describes for a period of 20 years from the date it is filed or recorded. The lien shall be a disposition
of the claim sufficient to permit the estate to close.
    (e) The state or county agency shall file or record the lien in the office of the county recorder
or registrar of titles for each county in which any of the real property is located. The recorder or
registrar of titles shall accept the lien for filing or recording. All recording or filing fees shall be paid
by the Department of Human Services. The recorder or registrar of titles shall mail the recorded lien
to the Department of Human Services. The lien need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as
a condition of recording or filing. Upon recording or filing of a lien against a life estate or a joint
tenancy interest, the interest subject to the lien shall merge into the remainder interest or the interest
the recipient and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent
of the decedent's interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death as determined under this
section.
    (f) The department shall make no adjustment or recovery under the lien until after the decedent's
spouse, if any, has died, and only at a time when the decedent has no surviving child described in
subdivision 3. The estate, any owner of an interest in the property which is or may be subject to
the lien, or any other interested party, may voluntarily pay off, settle, or otherwise satisfy the claim
secured or to be secured by the lien at any time before or after the lien is filed or recorded. Such
payoffs, settlements, and satisfactions shall be deemed to be voluntary repayments of past medical
assistance payments for the benefit of the deceased recipient, and neither the process of settling the
claim, the payment of the claim, or the acceptance of a payment shall constitute an adjustment or
recovery that is prohibited under this subdivision.
    (g) The lien under this subdivision may be enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided by
law for the enforcement of judgment liens against real estate or by a foreclosure by action under
chapter 581. When the lien is paid, satisfied, or otherwise discharged, the state or county agency
shall prepare and file a release of lien at its own expense. No action to foreclose the lien shall be
commenced unless the lien holder has first given 30 days' prior written notice to pay the lien to the
owners and parties in possession of the property subject to the lien. The notice shall: (1) include the
name, address, and telephone number of the lien holder; (2) describe the lien; (3) give the amount
of the lien; (4) inform the owner or party in possession that payment of the lien in full must be made
to the lien holder within 30 days after service of the notice or the lien holder may begin proceedings
to foreclose the lien; and (5) be served by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested,
ordinary first class mail, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
in which any part of the property is located. Service of the notice shall be complete upon mailing
or publication."

clearance certificate. If the real property is registered property, a new certificate of title must not be
issued until the clearance certificate is recorded. If the clearance certificate shows the continuation
of a medical assistance claim or lien after issuance of the clearance certificate, the real property
remains subject to the claim or lien. If the real property is registered property, the clearance
certificate must be carried forward as a memorial in any new certificate of title."

   Subdivision 1. Definitions. As used in this section, "animals" means cattle, swine, sheep, goats,
poultry, farmed cervidae, as defined in section 35.153, subdivision 3, llamas, as defined in section
17.455, subdivision 2, ratitae, as defined in section 17.453, subdivision 3, equines and other large
domesticated animals.
    Subd. 1a. Tag or notice. A duly authorized agent of the commissioner who finds or has probable
cause to believe that any food, animal, or consumer commodity is adulterated or so misbranded as
to be dangerous or fraudulent, or is in violation of section 31.131 shall affix to such article or animal
a tag or other appropriate marking giving notice that such article or animal is, or is suspected of
being, adulterated or misbranded and has been detained or embargoed, and warning all persons not
to remove or dispose of such article or animal by sale or otherwise until permission for removal or
disposal is given by such agent or the court. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or dispose
of such detained or embargoed article or animal by sale or otherwise without such permission.
    Subd. 2. Action for condemnation. When an article or animal detained or embargoed under
subdivision 1 has been found by such agent to be adulterated, or misbranded, the agent shall petition
the district court in the county in which the article or animal is detained or embargoed for an order
and decree for the condemnation of such article or animal. Any such agent who has found that an
article or animal so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, shall remove the tag
or other marking.
    Subd. 3. Remedies. If the court finds that a detained or embargoed article or animal is adulterated
or misbranded, such article or animal shall, after entry of the decree, be destroyed at the expense of
the claimant thereof, under the supervision of such agent, and all court costs and fees, and storage and
other proper expenses, shall be taxed against the claimant of such article or animal or the claimant's
agent; provided, that when the adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or
processing of the article or animal, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees,
and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond, conditioned that such article or animal
shall be so labeled or processed, has been executed, may by order direct that such article or animal
be delivered to claimant thereof for such labeling or processing under the supervision of an agent of
the commissioner. The expense of such supervision shall be paid by claimant. The article or animal
shall be returned to the claimant and the bond shall be discharged on the representation to the court
by the commissioner that the article or animal is no longer in violation and that the expenses of such
supervision have been paid.
    Subd. 4. Duties of commissioner. Whenever the commissioner or any of the commissioner's
authorized agents shall find in any room, building, vehicle of transportation or other structure, any
meat, seafood, poultry, vegetable, fruit, or other perishable articles of food which are unsound, or
contain any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or that may be poisonous or deleterious to
health or otherwise unsafe, the same being hereby declared to be a nuisance, the commissioner, or
the commissioner's authorized agent, shall forthwith condemn or destroy the same, or in any other
manner render the same unsalable as human food, and no one shall have any cause of action against
the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized agent on account of such action.
    Subd. 5. Emergency response. In the event of an emergency declared by the governor's order
under section 12.31, if the commissioner finds or has probable cause to believe that ­
                                                                                     a livestock, food,
or a consumer commodity within a specific area is likely to be adulterated because of the emergency
or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent, or is in violation of section 31.131, subdivision
1, the commissioner may embargo a geographic area that is included in the declared emergency.

such employment pending investigation and during the period of infectiousness, if such person is

health.

an existing veterinarian-client-patient relationship. The prescribing veterinarian must monitor the
use of veterinary prescription drugs, human drugs for extra-label use, or over-the-counter drugs
for extra-label use by a client.
    (b) A veterinarian may dispense prescription veterinary drugs and prescribe and dispense
extra-label use drugs to a client without personally examining the animal if a bona fide
veterinarian-client-patient relationship exists and in the judgment of the veterinarian the client has
sufficient knowledge to use the drugs properly.
    (c) A veterinarian may issue a prescription or other veterinary authorization by oral or written
communication to the dispenser, or by computer connection. If the communication is oral, the
veterinarian must enter it into the patient's record. The dispenser must record the veterinarian's
prescription or other veterinary authorization within 72 hours.
    (d) A prescription or other veterinary authorization must include:
    (1) the name, address, and, if written, the signature of the prescriber;

    239.77 BIODIESEL CONTENT MANDATE.
    Subdivision 1. Biodiesel fuel. "Biodiesel fuel" means a renewable, biodegradable, mono alkyl
ester combustible liquid fuel that is derived from agricultural and other plant oils or animal fats and
that meets American Society For Testing and Materials specification D6751-07 for Biodiesel Fuel
(B100) Blend Stock for Distillate Fuels.
    Biodiesel produced from palm oil is not biodiesel fuel for the purposes of this section, unless
the palm oil is contained within waste oil and grease collected within the United States or Canada.

     (4)                          May 1, 2015              20 percent

    The minimum content levels in clauses (3) and (4) are effective during the months of April,
May, June, July, August, September, and October only. The minimum content for the remainder
of the year is five percent. However, if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution
control determine, after consultation with the biodiesel task force and other technical experts, that
an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard exists
for the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses that adequately addresses technical issues
associated with Minnesota's cold weather and publish a notice in the State Register to that effect,
the commissioners may allow the specified biodiesel blend level in those clauses to be effective
year-round.

    (b) The minimum content levels in paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), become effective on
the date specified only if the commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control
publish notice in the State Register and provide written notice to the chairs of the house and senate
committees with jurisdiction over agriculture, commerce, and transportation policy and finance, at
least 270 days prior to the date of each scheduled increase, that all of the following conditions have
been met and the state is prepared to move to the next scheduled minimum content level:
    (1) an American Society for Testing and Materials specification or equivalent federal standard
exists for the next minimum diesel-biodiesel blend;
    (2) a sufficient supply of biodiesel is available and the amount of biodiesel produced in this state
from feedstock with at least 75 percent that is produced in the United States and Canada is equal to
at least 50 percent of anticipated demand at the next minimum content level;
   (3) adequate blending infrastructure and regulatory protocol are in place in order to promote
biodiesel quality and avoid any potential economic disruption; and
    (4) at least five percent of the amount of biodiesel necessary for that minimum content level will
be produced from a biological resource other than an agricultural resource traditionally grown or
raised in the state, including, but not limited to, algae cultivated for biofuels production, waste oils,
and tallow.
    The condition in clause (4) may be waived if the commissioners find that the use of these
nontraditional feedstocks would be uneconomic under market conditions existing at the time notice
is given under this paragraph.
    (c) The commissioners of agriculture, commerce, and pollution control must consult with the
biodiesel task force when assessing and certifying conditions in paragraph (b), and in general must
seek the guidance of the biodiesel task force regarding biodiesel labeling, enforcement, and other
related issues.
    (d) During a period of biodiesel fuel shortage or a problem with biodiesel quality that negatively
affects the availability of biodiesel fuel, the commissioner of commerce may temporarily suspend
the minimum content requirement in subdivision 2 until there is sufficient biodiesel fuel, as defined
in subdivision 1, available to fulfill the minimum content requirement.
    (e) By February 1, 2012, and periodically thereafter, the commissioner of commerce shall
determine the wholesale diesel price at various pipeline and refinery terminals in the region, and
the biodiesel price determined after credits and incentives are subtracted at biodiesel plants in
the region. The commissioner shall report wholesale price differences to the governor who, after
consultation with the commissioners of commerce and agriculture, may by executive order adjust
the biodiesel mandate if a price disparity reported by the commissioner will cause economic
hardship to retailers of diesel fuel in this state. Any adjustment must be for a specified period of
time, after which the percentage of biodiesel fuel to be blended into diesel fuel returns to the amount
required in subdivision 2. The biodiesel mandate must not be adjusted to less than five percent.

     (2) railroad locomotives; and
     (3) off-road taconite and copper mining equipment and machinery.
   (b) The exemption in paragraph (a), clause (1), expires 30 days after the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has approved the use of biodiesel fuel in motors at electric generating plants under its
regulation.
    Subd. 4. Disclosure. A refinery or terminal shall provide, at the time diesel fuel is sold or
transferred from the refinery or terminal, a bill of lading or shipping manifest to the person who
receives the fuel. For biodiesel-blended products, the bill of lading or shipping manifest must
disclose biodiesel content, stating volume percentage, gallons of biodiesel per gallons of petroleum
diesel base-stock, or an ASTM "Bxx" designation where "xx" denotes the volume percent biodiesel
included in the blended product. This subdivision does not apply to sales or transfers of biodiesel
blend stock between refineries, between terminals, or between a refinery and a terminal.
    Subd. 5. Annual report. Beginning in 2009, the commissioner of agriculture must report by
January 15 of each year to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees
and divisions with jurisdiction over agriculture policy and finance regarding the implementation
of the minimum content requirements in subdivision 2, including information about the price and
supply of biodiesel fuel. The report shall include information about the impacts of the biodiesel
mandate on the development of biodiesel production capacity in the state, and on the use of feedstock
grown or raised in the state for biodiesel production. The report must include any written comments
received from members of the biodiesel fuel task force by January 1 of that year designated by them
for inclusion in the report.
