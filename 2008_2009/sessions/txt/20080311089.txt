the acknowledgment. The bottom of the acknowledgment shall include the following disclosure in
bold, 14-point type:
       The cancellation of the foreclosure sale on your property is the result of a law passed by
       the Minnesota Legislature in 2008. You must make the monthly payment in full by the due
       dates listed in this letter. If you do not make the payments on time, we will have the right to
       schedule a foreclosure sale on your property.
   Subd. 4. Charges prohibited. A foreclosing lender shall not charge an eligible foreclosed

amount of payment shall be the lesser of: (1) the monthly payment of principal and interest on the
date the loan was originated; or (2) 65 percent of the monthly payment of principal and interest
at the time the borrower defaulted prior to foreclosure. For an eligible foreclosed borrower with a
negative amortization loan that is not also a subprime loan, the amount of payment would be the
minimum monthly payment on the date the loan was originated.
    Subd. 3. Payment advice notice. The foreclosing lender shall provide to the eligible foreclosed
borrower monthly written payment advice notices. The notice shall be sent by the first day of each
month until the expiration of the deferment period or the loss of the deferment under subdivision
4. Each notice shall state (1) the amount of payment owed from the eligible foreclosed borrower;
(2) the address to which the borrower should send the deferment payment; and (3) the date that the
payment must be received to avoid loss of the deferment right under subdivision 4. The payment
advice notice shall be on a single sheet of paper, shall use plain language, and no other documents
shall be included with the notice. The bottom of the notice shall include the following disclosure in
bold, 14-point type:
       The deferment of the foreclosure sale on your property is the result of a law passed by the
       Minnesota Legislature in 2008. You must continue to make the monthly payment in full by

in the amount required and by the date required under this section shall lose the deferment right.

    Subdivision 1. Dispute as to eligible foreclosed loan status. If the foreclosing lender determines
after a reasonable investigation and in good faith that the person submitting an affidavit of deferment
is not the mortgagor under an eligible foreclosed loan, the foreclosing lender shall provide a notice
of denial of deferment to the person submitting the affidavit of deferment. The foreclosing lender
must send a notice of denial by certified mail through the United States mail within ten business
days of receiving the affidavit of deferment. The notice is effective on mailing. The notice of denial
shall be on a single sheet of paper and no other documents shall be included with the notice. Such
notice must include an explanation, in plain language, of the reasons that the loan is not an eligible
foreclosed loan. Such notice must also inform the person who executed the affidavit of deferment
that the person has the right to apply to the court for an order deferring the foreclosure sale.
    Subd. 2. Other disputes. For any other dispute about the deferment right or other rights or
requirements under the act, a person can apply to the district court in the county where the property
is located for an order establishing the rights of the parties to the dispute.
   Subd. 3. Effect of deferral right. Nothing in this act shall alter contractual rights of the parties

to the mortgage loan other than providing the right to defer a foreclosure sale. A bona fide purchaser
of an interest in real property mortgaged by an eligible foreclosed loan takes the interest in the real
property not subject to any claims of ownership by a party based on any rights under this act.
   Sec. 7. [583.39] NOTICE OF RIGHT TO DEFERMENT.
    Subdivision 1. Notice requirement; form and delivery of notice. Every foreclosing lender
shall send to each borrower who has an eligible foreclosed loan a notice of right to deferment.
The notice of right to deferment shall be in the form of, and subject to the delivery requirements
specified in, section 580.041, subdivision 1b. The notice of right to deferment must also indicate
an address at which the foreclosing lender will accept service of an affidavit of deferment under
section 583.36, subdivision 2. The terms of section 580.041, subdivisions 3 and 4, apply to this
section. Notwithstanding the above, a foreclosing lender must within three days after the first day
of the deferment period send the notice of right to deferment to each borrower who has an eligible
foreclosed loan who has a foreclosure sale scheduled within 20 days of the first day of the deferment
period, and must within 14 days after the first day of the deferment period send the notice of right
to deferment to all other borrowers who have an eligible foreclosed loan at the beginning of the
deferment period.
   Subd. 2. Content. The notice required by this section must appear substantially as follows:
"Emergency Help For Homeowners in Foreclosure:
IMPORTANT: You are eligible to have the foreclosure of your home stopped until at least (end of
deferment period).
The state of Minnesota recently passed a law that lets homeowners stop a foreclosure sale. To qualify,
you must currently live at the home in foreclosure and intend to live at the home until the end of the
deferment period.
You will also need to complete and sign a special form (called an "affidavit") and provide that
affidavit to us at the following address: (insert address in the state of Minnesota).
There are many government agencies and nonprofit organizations that can help you complete
this affidavit. For the name and telephone number of an organization near you, please call the
Minnesota Housing Finance Agency (MHFA) at (insert telephone number/Web site). The state
does not guarantee the advice of these agencies.
Do not delay dealing with the foreclosure because your options for foreclosure deferment end with
the foreclosure sale."
   Sec. 8. [583.40] BAD FAITH OR RECKLESS VIOLATION.
    A foreclosing lender who acts in bad faith or recklessly in violation of sections 583.35 to 583.39
shall be liable to a person injured by the violation for actual damages, statutory damages of up to
$25,000, punitive damages in an amount determined by the court, costs, and reasonable attorney's
fees.
   Sec. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Sections 1 to 8 are effective seven days following final enactment."

    Subd. 8. Land status. Land received in exchange for Class 1 land is subject to the same trust,
if any, and otherwise has the same status as the land given in exchange. Land received in exchange
for Class 2 land is subject to a trust in favor of the governmental subdivision wherein it lies and all
laws relating to tax-forfeited land. Land received in exchange for Class 3 land has the same status
as the land given in exchange.

state shall provide each county and municipality with the appropriate forms for this certification. The

    (b) A judge may, before the applicant signs the roster, confirm the applicant's name, address, and
date of birth.
    (c) After the applicant signs the roster, the judge shall give the applicant a voter's receipt. The
voter shall deliver the voter's receipt to the judge in charge of ballots as proof of the voter's right
to vote, and thereupon the judge shall hand to the voter the ballot. The voters' receipts must be
maintained during the time for notice of filing an election contest."
