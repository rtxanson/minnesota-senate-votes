a single-metered residential building shall be the bill payer responsible, and shall be the customer
of record contracting with the utility for utility services. The landlord must advise the utility provider
that the utility services apply to a single-metered residential building. A failure by the landlord to
comply with this subdivision is a violation of sections 504B.161, subdivision 1, clause (1), and
504B.221. This subdivision may not be waived by contract or otherwise. This subdivision does not
require a landlord to contract and pay for utility service provided to each residential unit through
a separate meter which accurately measures that unit's use only. This subdivision does not prohibit
a landlord from apportioning utility service payments among residential units and either including
utility costs in a unit's rent or billing for utility charges separate from rent.
      Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 504B.215, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Procedure. (a) When a municipality, utility company, or other company supplying
home heating oil, propane, natural gas, electricity, or water to a building has issued a final notice or
has posted the building proposing to disconnect or discontinue the service to the building because a
landlord who has contracted for the service has failed to pay for it or because a landlord is required
by law or contract to pay for the service and fails to do so, a tenant or group of tenants may pay
to have the service continued or reconnected as provided under this section. If a building is posted,
the posting must be placed in at least one conspicuous location in the building and provide tenants
with, at a minimum, the following information:
      (1) the date the service will be discontinued;
      (2) the telephone number to call at the utility to obtain further information;
      (3) a brief description of the rights of tenants under this section to continue or restore service;
and
   (4) advice to consider seeking assistance from legal aid, a private attorney, or a housing
organization in exercising the rights of tenants under Minnesota law to maintain their utility service.
Before paying for the service, the tenant or group of tenants shall give oral or written notice to the
landlord of the tenant's intention to pay after 48 hours, or a shorter period that is reasonable under
the circumstances, if the landlord has not already paid for the service. In the case of oral notification,
written notice shall be mailed or delivered to the landlord within 24 hours after oral notice is given.
    (b) In the case of natural gas,  ­or electricity, o

building with less than five units, one of the tenants may notify the utility company or municipality
that the tenant agrees to become the bill payer responsible and customer of record and the utility
company or municipality must place the account disconnected or subject to disconnection in the
tenant's name and provide service prospectively, provided the tenant satisfies all requirements for
establishing service. A tenant becoming the customer of record of a cooperative electric association
does not acquire membership rights. Exercise of the right to pay the current charges for the most
recent billing period does not preclude exercising the right to become the bill payer responsible and
customer of record, provided that if there are multiple tenants in an affected multifamily building, the
9556                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [111TH DAY

utility company or municipality is not required to offer the right to become the bill payer responsible
and the customer of record to more than one tenant in a 12-month period.
   (c) In the case of water, if the landlord has not paid the bill by the time of the tenant's intended
payment or if the service remains discontinued, upon request from a tenant, a municipality must
provide a copy of each bill the landlord fails to pay. The tenant:
    (1) has a continuing right to pay the current charges for the most recent billing period and retain
service;
    (2) has the period of time provided by the governing ordinance, policy, or practice within which
to pay the charges;
    (3) is not subject to any deposit requirements; and
    (4) is entitled to reasonable notice of any disconnection.
     This paragraph does not require a municipality to alter its accounting system or billing records
if the tenant exercises the right to pay current charges and retain water service. If there are multiple
tenants in an affected property, the municipality is not required to offer the right to pay current
charges and retain service to more than one tenant in a 12-month period.
    (d) For purposes of this subdivision, "current charges" does not include arrears or late payment
fees incurred by the landlord.
   ­
   (­
    c­) (e) In a single-metered residential building, other residential tenants in the building may
contribute payments to the utility company or municipality on the account of the tenant who is the
customer of record under paragraph (b) or on the landlord's account under paragraph (c).
    (f) A landlord who satisfies all requirements for reestablishing service, including paying, or
entering into an agreement acceptable to the utility company or municipality to pay, all arrears and
other lawful charges incurred by the landlord on the account that was placed in the tenant's name,
may reestablish service in the landlord's name.
    (g) This section does not restrict or prohibit a municipal utility provider from exercising its
authority pursuant to section 444.075, subdivisions 3 and 3e, to make contracts with and impose
utility charges against property owners and to certify unpaid charges to the county auditor with
taxes against the property served for collection as a tax.
   (h) In the case of home heating oil or propane, if the landlord has not yet paid the bill by the
time of the tenant's intended payment, or if the service remains discontinued, the tenant or tenants
may order and pay for one month's supply of the proper grade and quality of oil or propane.

NEGOTIATION.
    Subdivision 1. Cancellation of deferment. If the foreclosing lender has negotiated in good
faith to modify the eligible foreclosed loan, the foreclosing lender may send a notice of deferment
cancellation to the eligible foreclosed borrower and, no less than 30 days after sending the notice,
publish a notice of foreclosure sale in accord with section 583.35. The notice shall be on a single
sheet of paper and shall include the name and contact information for an employee or representative
of the foreclosing lender. Such notice must include an explanation, in plain language, of the reasons
that the deferment is being canceled. Such notice must prominently state the date the notice is mailed
to the eligible foreclosed borrower and the bottom of the notice shall include the following disclosure
in bold, 14-point type: "If you do not agree that we have negotiated in good faith to modify your
loan, you may request that an arbitrator be appointed to review your case. The arbitrator will be a
volunteer who will work at no cost to you. You have until (insert date 30 days after date of notice)
to complete and mail the attached request for arbitration form to the address listed on the form.
The state of Minnesota encourages you to contact a mortgage foreclosure counselor right away to
discuss your options." The foreclosing lender shall include a copy of the written loan modification
that the foreclosing lender offered as part of a good-faith negotiation offer under subdivision 2. No
documents other than the written loan modification offer and the arbitration request form required

by subdivision 2 shall be included with the notice. A copy of the notice also must be sent by any
means to the mortgage foreclosure counselor who signed the affidavit of deferment.
    Subd. 2. Arbitration of disputes. (a) The eligible foreclosed borrower may dispute a notice of
deferment cancellation by sending to the commissioner a request for arbitration form along with a
copy of the notice of deferment cancellation, including a copy of the written loan modification that
the foreclosing lender asserts is a good-faith negotiation offer under this subdivision. The request
for arbitration must be delivered or postmarked within 30 days of the date of the notice of deferment
cancellation. The deferment continues pending resolution of the dispute.
    (b) On receipt of a timely request for arbitration, the commissioner shall appoint a volunteer
arbitrator to resolve the dispute as to whether the foreclosing lender negotiated with the eligible
foreclosed borrower in good faith. The commissioner may appoint any person the commissioner
deems qualified to act as a volunteer arbitrator.
    (c) The volunteer arbitrator may request additional documents or appearances from either the
foreclosing lender or the eligible foreclosed borrower prior to making a determination. The decision
of the arbitrator is binding on both the foreclosing lender and the eligible foreclosed borrower.
    (d) The appointed arbitrator will act as a volunteer and may not charge any person for the
arbitrator's services or costs related to the arbitration.
    Subd. 3. Good-faith negotiation by foreclosing lender. (a) A foreclosing lender has not
negotiated in good faith unless it offers in writing to modify the terms of repayment of the eligible
foreclosed loan to permit the eligible foreclosed borrower to make monthly payments that the
borrower would have had the reasonable ability to pay as of the date the loan was originated or,
if the borrower's income and financial resources have increased since the loan was originated,
monthly payments that the borrower has the current reasonable ability to pay.
    (b) For purposes of this section, "monthly payments" includes principal, interest, real estate
taxes, homeowner's insurance, assessments, and mortgage insurance premiums, as applicable.
    (c) For purposes of this section, "reasonable ability to pay" shall be determined based on the
following:
    (1) the income and financial resources available to the borrower at the time the loan was
originated, provided that tax returns, payroll receipts, bank records, or other similarly reliable
documents that verify the borrower's income and financial resources at the time of origination shall
replace unverified statements of income or financial resources contained in the loan application,
and such verified information shall serve as the basis for computing the borrower's reasonable
ability to make monthly payments; or
    (2) if the borrower's income and other financial resources have increased since the loan
was originated, the borrower's current income and other financial resources to the extent such
information can be verified by tax returns, payroll receipts, bank records, or other similarly reliable
documents.
   (d) There is a presumption that the borrower has the reasonable ability to pay if the monthly
payments do not exceed a combined debt-to-income ratio of 41 percent based on the borrower's
documented and verified monthly gross income, provided the borrower has sufficient residual
income as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title 38, section 36.4337(e)."

July 1, 2009;

claimant in any other case, for claims arising on or after July 1, 2009;
    (d) $750,000 for any number of claims arising out of a single occurrence, for claims arising on

proper share of the amount available under the applicable limit under clause (d), (e), (f), or (g). The
share apportioned to each claimant shall be in the proportion that the ratio of the award or settlement
bears to the aggregate awards and settlements for all claims arising out of the occurrence.
    The limitation imposed by this subdivision on individual claimants includes damages claimed
for loss of services or loss of support arising out of the same tort.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from August 1, 2007.
   Sec. 2. [3.7391] PURPOSE.
    Subdivision 1. Findings; I-35W bridge. The legislature finds that the collapse of the Interstate
Highway 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007, was a
catastrophe of historic proportions. The bridge was the third-busiest in the state, carrying over
140,000 cars per day. Its collapse killed 13 people and injured more than 100. No other structure
owned by this state has ever fallen with such devastating physical and psychological impact on so
many.
     Subd. 2. Compensation process. The establishment of a compensation process under sections
3.7391 to 3.7394 for survivors of the catastrophe furthers the public interest by providing a remedy
for survivors while avoiding the uncertainty and expense of potentially complex and protracted
litigation to resolve the issue of the liability of the state, a municipality, or their employees for
damages incurred by survivors.
    Subd. 3. Not an admission of liability. These findings are not an admission of liability of the
state, a municipality, or their employees for damages caused by the catastrophe.
   Sec. 3. [3.7392] DEFINITIONS.
9568                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [111TH DAY

   Subdivision 1. Application. The definitions in this section apply to sections 3.7391 to 3.7394.
   Subd. 2. Catastrophe. "Catastrophe" means the collapse of the I-35W bridge over the
Mississippi River in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007.
    Subd. 3. Damages. "Damages" means damages that are compensable under state tort law and
damages for wrongful death that are compensable under section 573.02. Damages do not include
punitive damages or attorney fees or other fees incurred by a survivor in making a claim under this
section or other law.
    Subd. 4. Emergency relief fund. "Emergency relief fund" means the I-35W bridge emergency
relief fund created by the state on November 30, 2007.
   Subd. 5. Municipality. "Municipality" has the meaning given in section 466.01.
   Subd. 6. Panel. "Panel" means the special master panel created under section 3.7393.
   Subd. 7. State. "State" has the meaning given in section 3.732.
    Subd. 8. Survivor. "Survivor" means a natural person who was present on the I-35W bridge at
the time of the collapse. Survivor also includes:
   (1) the parent or legal guardian of a survivor who is under 18 years of age;
   (2) a legally appointed representative of a survivor; or
    (3) the surviving spouse or next of kin of a deceased survivor who would be entitled to bring an
action under section 573.02.
   Sec. 4. [3.7393] CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.
    Subdivision 1. Special master panel. The chief justice of the Supreme Court shall establish
a special master panel to consider claims, make offers of settlement, and enter into settlement
agreements with survivors on behalf of the state. The panel must be established by June 30,
2008. The panel must consist of three attorneys. Members of the panel must have experience in
legal issues involving the settlement of tort claims and the determination of damages. The chief
justice shall designate a member of the panel to serve as chair of the panel. The chief justice shall
determine the pay and expenses to be received by the panel.
    Subd. 2. Staff. Within the limits of available appropriations, the state court administrator, in
consultation with the panel, shall hire employees or retain consultants necessary to assist the panel
in performing its duties under this section. Employees are in the unclassified state civil service. The
panel may also use consultants who are under a contract with the state or current state employees to
assist the panel in processing claims under this section.
    Subd. 3. Records. Records of the panel related to a claim filed by a survivor, an offer of
settlement, or an acceptance or rejection of an offer are not accessible to the public except for:
   (1) the name of the survivor; and
   (2) the terms of any written settlement agreement between the survivor and the state.
   Subd. 4. Procedure. Consistent with sections 3.7391 to 3.7394, the panel may adopt and
111TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 5, 2008                                        9569

modify procedures, rules, and forms for considering claims, making offers of settlement, entering
into settlement agreements, and considering requests for and making supplemental payments. The
panel must allow each survivor to appear in person before the panel or one of its members.
    Subd. 5. Payment of panel expenses. The state court administrator shall forward documentation
of salaries, expenses, and administrative costs under this section to the commissioner of finance for
payment of those amounts.
    Subd. 6. Immunity. Members of the panel and employees and consultants acting under the
direction of the panel are absolutely immune from civil liability for any act or omission occurring
within the scope of the performance of their duties under this section.
    Subd. 7. General duties. The panel shall consider claims, make offers of settlement, and
enter into settlement agreements with survivors as provided in this section. The panel must not
consider negligence or any other theory of liability. The panel shall make offers of settlement and
supplemental payments under this section with the assumption that no future appropriation will be
available for these purposes and shall include a notice of this provision when making settlement
offers.
    Subd. 8. Effect and finality of offers and settlement agreements. (a) An offer of settlement
made to a survivor under this section is considered for all purposes to be an offer to the survivor to
settle a legal claim.
   (b) A determination by the panel regarding an offer of settlement or settlement agreement or a
supplemental payment is final and not subject to judicial review.
    (c) The amount of damages incurred by a survivor calculated by the panel pursuant to subdivision
10 may not be used in a subsequent court proceeding in evidence or otherwise to determine any
rights, duties, or responsibilities of the state or any other party.
    Subd. 9. Deadlines. In order to be eligible to receive an offer of settlement or enter into a
settlement agreement under this section or to receive a supplemental payment under subdivision
12, a survivor must file a claim with the panel by October 15, 2008. Any offer of settlement must be
made by February 28, 2009. A survivor must accept or reject the offer of settlement within 45 days
after receiving the offer. Failure to accept an offer within 45 days is a rejection. A survivor who
is eligible to receive a supplemental payment under subdivision 12 may choose to wait until the
survivor's supplemental payment is calculated before accepting or rejecting an offer of settlement,
provided that a survivor may not accept an offer of settlement later than 45 days after receiving
notice of the proposed supplemental payment award. The decision to accept or reject an offer is
irrevocable. The panel must notify a survivor of the deadlines for response to an offer of settlement
as provided in this subdivision.
    Subd. 10. Calculation of amount. The panel shall determine the total damages incurred by a
survivor. The amount of an offer of settlement under this section must be calculated based on the
total damages, less:
   (1) payments made to the survivor up to the date the settlement offer is made from the collateral
sources referred to in section 548.36, subdivision 1;
   (2) any payment made to the survivor from the emergency relief fund; and
9570                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [111TH DAY

    (3) any payments made or required to be made to the survivor by a third-party tortfeasor under
the terms of a settlement or other agreement with the survivor that exists at the time the offer is
made or a final judgment in favor of the survivor concerning claims of the survivor that relate to,
involve, or arise out of the catastrophe.
    Subd. 11. Offers of settlement; limit on amount. (a) The amount of an offer of settlement
or payment required by a settlement agreement must not exceed $400,000. This limitation does
not apply to a supplemental payment made under subdivision 12. An offer of settlement must be
accompanied by a notice to the survivor of the remainder of the amount calculated under subdivision
10 that is not included in the offer because of the limitation under this paragraph and the amount of
the remainder for which a supplemental payment may be awarded.
    (b) Notwithstanding section 3.736, subdivision 4, clause (e), or section 466.04, subdivision
1, paragraph (a), clause (5), the $1,000,000 limitation on state or municipal liability for claims
arising out of a single occurrence otherwise applicable to the catastrophe does not apply to payments
made to survivors under this section. The amount that may be paid by the state is limited by the
appropriations for this purpose.
  Subd. 12. Supplemental payments. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "uncompensated
medical expenses" means:
    (1) medical expenses less payments made to a survivor from collateral sources referred to in
section 548.36, subdivision 1, that provide payments for medical expenses; and
   (2) the present value of premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance payments for high-risk health
plan coverage offered by the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association or by another similar
health plan.
    (b) A survivor is eligible for a supplemental payment if the offer of settlement calculation for
the survivor, as provided in subdivision 10, exceeds $400,000. The supplemental payment must be
calculated based solely on that portion of the uncompensated medical expenses, loss of income,
future earning capacity, or other financial support for which compensation was not received under
the offer of settlement or settlement agreement under subdivision 11. A supplemental payment
may only be made to a survivor who has accepted an offer of settlement, entered into a settlement
agreement, and executed a release under subdivision 13. Consistent with the requirements of this
section, the panel shall establish necessary procedures and timelines for the award of supplemental
payments. A supplemental payment may be made only for the following purposes, in the following
order of priority:
   (1) to pay uncompensated medical expenses in excess of those paid from the first $400,000; and
    (2) to pay for loss of income, future earning capacity, or other financial support not included in
the first $400,000.
   No payment may be made to a survivor for loss of income under clause (2) unless and until all
survivors have been fully paid for all medical expenses for which they are eligible under clause (1).
    (c) If the available appropriation is insufficient to make full awards to all survivors eligible for
a supplemental payment, the panel may award the payments based on a uniform percentage of the
amount that is less than the full amount eligible for a supplemental payment or take other steps the
panel considers necessary to ensure that the available appropriation is equitably distributed among
111TH DAY]                           MONDAY, MAY 5, 2008                                         9571

all survivors who have requested and qualify for a supplemental payment, subject to the order of
priority under this subdivision.
    Subd. 13. Release. A survivor who accepts an offer of settlement from the panel must agree in
writing and in a form developed by the panel, with the approval of the attorney general, to release
the state and every municipality of this state and their employees from liability, including claims for
damages, arising from the catastrophe and to cooperate with the state in pursuing claims the state
may have against any other party. The release must also provide that the survivor will indemnify
the state, a municipality, and their employees from any claim of contribution or indemnity, or both,
made by other persons against the state, a municipality, and their employees and that the survivor
will satisfy any judgment obtained by the survivor in an action against other persons to the extent
of the release, if the claim or judgment relates in any way to a claim of the survivor arising from
the catastrophe. The release must provide for the subrogation interest of the state under section
3.7394, subdivision 5. A survivor who previously has commenced an administrative, court, or other
action against the state or a municipality of the state or their employees seeking recovery from
loss resulting from the catastrophe must agree to dismiss or otherwise withdraw the action before
receiving compensation under this section.
    Subd. 14. Payment. The panel shall promptly forward to the commissioner of finance
documentation of each settlement agreement that has been entered into under this section. Except
as provided in section 3.7394, subdivision 4, paragraph (b), the commissioner of finance shall pay
the agreed amount within 45 days after receiving the documentation and in the order in which the
documentation from the panel was received.
    Subd. 15. Election to proceed in district court. (a) A survivor may elect not to file a claim with
the panel or not to accept an offer of settlement from the panel. A survivor who elects not to file a
claim with the panel or not to accept an offer of settlement has not waived any legal rights that may
be asserted against the state or a municipality or their employees and may proceed with a claim in
district court.
   (b) If a survivor elects not to accept an offer of settlement, the state or a municipality or their
employees may not use any data provided by the survivor to the panel in a subsequent legal
proceeding. The state or a municipality or their employees may obtain information, including data
provided to the panel, through discovery or other legal processes.
  Sec. 5. [3.7394] EFFECT OF SPECIAL COMPENSATION PROCESS; RELATIONSHIP
TO OTHER LAW.
    Subdivision 1. No state liability or duty created. The establishment of the special compensation
process under section 3.7393 and the emergency relief fund, and an offer of settlement or a settlement
agreement, is not an admission of liability by the state or a municipality or their employees and does
not establish a duty of the state, a municipality, or their employees to compensate survivors. The
creation and funding of the compensation process under sections 3.7391 to 3.7394 or an offer of
settlement or settlement agreement is not admissible in a judicial or administrative proceeding to
establish liability or a legal duty.
    Subd. 2. Payments as additional compensation. Payments made under section 3.7393 or from
the emergency relief fund are intended to supplement and be in addition to any payments required
to be made by a third party under law or contract.
9572                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [111TH DAY

    Subd. 3. Payments from other sources. Notwithstanding any statutory or common law or
agreement to the contrary, a person required to make payments, including future payments, to
a survivor may not eliminate or reduce those payments as a result of compensation paid to the
survivor under section 3.7393 or from the emergency relief fund or as a result of the survivor's
release of claims against the state, a municipality, or their employees under section 3.7393. The
obligation of any person other than the state to make payments to a survivor is primary as compared
to any payment made or to be made under section 3.7393 or from the emergency relief fund. The
persons referenced in and covered by this subdivision and subdivision 4 include, without limitation:
    (1) reparation obligors, as defined in section 65B.43, subdivision 9, whether they are insurers or
self-insurers;
  (2) health plan companies, as defined in section 62Q.01, subdivision 4, including the Minnesota
Comprehensive Health Association created under section 62E.10;
   (3) insurance companies, as defined in section 60A.02, subdivision 4;
    (4) self-insured pools of political subdivisions organized under section 471.617 or 471.981,
including service cooperatives pools organized under section 123A.21;
   (5) risk retention groups, as defined in section 60E.02, subdivision 12;
   (6) joint self-insurance plans governed by chapter 60F;
   (7) workers' compensation insurers and private self-insurers, as defined in section 79.01;
   (8) the Minnesota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association governed by chapter 61B;
   (9) the Minnesota Insurance Guaranty Association governed by chapter 60C;
   (10) the Minnesota Joint Underwriting Association governed by chapter 62I;
   (11) all insurers providing credit life, credit accident and health, and credit involuntary
unemployment insurance under chapter 62B, but also including those coverages written in
connection with real estate mortgage loans and those provided to borrowers at no additional cost;
   (12) the Minnesota unemployment insurance program provided under chapter 268;
   (13) coverage offered by the state under medical assistance, general assistance medical care, and
MinnesotaCare; and
   (14) any other plan providing health, life, disability income, or long-term care coverage.
    Subd. 4. No third-party subrogation or recovery. (a) Notwithstanding any statutory                   or
common law or agreement to the contrary, a person who has paid benefits or compensation                  to
or on behalf of a survivor does not have a subrogation or other right to recover those benefits          or
compensation by making a claim, or recovering from payments made, under section 3.7393                   or
from the emergency relief fund.
    (b) Following a settlement agreement under section 3.7393, a person who believes that the state
cannot constitutionally prohibit assertion of a subrogation claim and who is claiming a subrogation
interest against the amount to be paid by the state has 40 days after the settlement agreement was
entered into to provide notice to the state and the survivor of the person's intent to assert that interest,

during which time the commissioner of finance must not make the payment. The subrogation claim
is waived if the notice is not provided by the deadline. If no notice is received by the deadline, the
commissioner of finance shall make the payment. If a notice of claim is received, the commissioner
shall withhold the payment until the subrogee abandons or waives the subrogation claim.
    Subd. 5. Reimbursement of state; right of subrogation. (a) Notwithstanding any statutory or
common law to the contrary, the state is entitled to recover from any third party, including an agent,
contractor, or vendor retained by the state, any payments made from the emergency relief fund or
under section 3.7393 to the extent the third party caused or contributed to the catastrophe. The state
is entitled to be reimbursed regardless of whether the survivor is fully compensated.
    (b) Notwithstanding any statutory or common law to the contrary, the state is subrogated to all
potential claims against third-party tortfeasors of a survivor receiving payment from the emergency
relief fund or under section 3.7393 to the extent the claims relate to, involve, or arise out of the
catastrophe. The subrogation right of the state under this subdivision is limited to the amount paid
to the survivor from the emergency relief fund and under section 3.7393. The rights of the state under
this subdivision are in addition to other remedies, claims, and rights relating to the catastrophe that
the state may have against other persons for the recovery of monetary or other relief.
    (c) A survivor must notify the state if the survivor has been fully compensated by third parties for
damages caused by the catastrophe. A survivor is fully compensated if payments made or required
to be made to the survivor by a third-party tortfeasor under the terms of a settlement agreement or
other agreement with the survivor or a final judgment in favor of the survivor concerning claims
that relate to, involve, or arise out of the catastrophe are equal to or greater than the total damages
incurred by the survivor as determined by the panel under section 3.7393, subdivision 10. The state
is entitled to be reimbursed by a survivor only to the extent that these payments are greater than the
total damages incurred by the survivor.
    Subd. 6. Amounts not considered for purposes of limit on government tort liability.
Payments made to survivors under section 3.7393 or from the emergency relief fund are not to be
considered in calculating the $1,000,000 limit on tort claims in civil actions against the state arising
out of the catastrophe for purposes of section 3.736, subdivision 4, clause (e), or a municipality
arising out of the catastrophe for purposes of section 466.04, subdivision 1, clause (5).
   Sec. 6. APPROPRIATIONS.
    Subdivision 1. Compensation to survivors. $24,000,000 is appropriated from the general fund
