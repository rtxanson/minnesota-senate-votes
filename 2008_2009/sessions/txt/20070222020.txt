    Subd. 4. Cellulosic biofuel producer payments. (a) The commissioner shall make cash
payments to eligible producers of cellulosic biofuel located in the state that have begun production
at a specific location by June 30, 2012. For the purpose of this subdivision, an entity that holds
a controlling interest in more than one cellulosic biofuel plant is considered a single eligible
producer. The amount of the payment for each eligible producer's annual production, except as
provided in paragraph (d), is 15 cents per gallon for each gallon of cellulosic biofuel produced at
a specific location for five years after the start of production. Cellulosic materials utilized in the
production of cellulosic biofuel must follow best available management practices or standards for
their establishment, growing, and harvesting. Cellulosic biofuel produced from corn stover or any
row crop must be grown according to management plans based on the University of Minnesota or

    (c) No payments shall be made for cellulosic biofuel production that occurs after June 30,
2022, for those eligible biofuel producers under paragraph (a), and 2025 for those eligible biofuel
producers under paragraph (b). An eligible producer of cellulosic biofuel shall not transfer the
producer's eligibility for payments under this section to a cellulosic biofuel facility at a different
location.
    (d) If the level of production at a cellulosic biofuel facility increases due to an increase in
the production capacity of the facility, the payment under paragraph (a) applies to the additional
increment of production until five years after the increased production began and under paragraph
(b) applies to the additional increment of production until ten years after the increased production
began. If capacity under paragraph (a) is converted to payment under paragraph (b), the ten-year
payment limit starts when the capacity increased under paragraph (a). Once a facility's production
capacity reaches 15,000,000 gallons per year, no additional increment will qualify for the payment.
   (e) Payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) to all eligible biofuel producers may not exceed
$27,000,000 in a fiscal year. Total payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) to an eligible biofuel
producer in a fiscal year may not exceed the amount necessary for 15,000,000 gallons of biofuel
production.
    (f) An eligible biofuel producer may blend cellulosic feedstocks eligible under paragraphs (a)

this subdivision, the volume of cellulosic biofuel production must be examined by an independent
certified public accountant in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.
    (h) Payments must be made November 15, February 15, May 15, and August 15. A separate
payment must be made for each claim filed. The total quarterly payment to an eligible producer under
this paragraph may not exceed the amount necessary for 3,750,000 gallons of biofuel production.
    (i) If an eligible biofuel producer becomes ineligible within five years after the last payment has
been received under paragraph (a), and ten years after under paragraph (b), all payments received
for biofuel production must be refunded to the commissioner. Refunded payments received under
this paragraph shall be deposited in the general fund.
    (j) Annually, within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year, a cellulosic biofuel producer
receiving payments under this subdivision must file a disclosure statement on a form provided
by the commissioner. The initial disclosure statement must include a summary description of the
organization of the business structure of the claimant, a listing of the percentages of ownership
