The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 320, Senate File 875, a bill related to minimum wage.
I have repeatedly supported minimum wage increases as both the Governor and as a legislator. As
recently as 2005, I signed into law a bill increasing the minimum wage.
Significantly, even with my veto of this bill, the minimum wage will increase to $6.55 this year and
$7.25 next year for most employers pursuant to increases established under federal law. The federal
minimum wage increases were accomplished through a bipartisan compromise at the federal level
and allow for a tip credit. Unfortunately, and once again, this bill does not reflect similar bipartisan
agreement.
As the Legislature addressed the state minimum wage again this year, I was very clear that I
would support a reasonable increase to the state minimum wage, provided that the bill included
an acceptable tip credit. A tip credit allows an employer to pay a slightly lower minimum wage to
employees whose jobs include the receipt of significant earnings through tips. Unfortunately, the
authors of the bill chose to ignore my concerns and passed a bill that increases the minimum wage
to more than 50 percent above the 2005 rate and does not include a tip credit for tipped employees.
My Administration presented a compromise so that the tip credit would only apply to increases in
the minimum wage, so that no employees would see a reduction in their current wage. That offer
was rejected.
Minnesota is one of only a handful of states that do not recognize a tip credit at the state level. A
tip credit is applied in 43 states for calculating the base wage for tipped employees. The tip credit
is essential for the continued viability of many employers.
The minimum wage increase in S.F. 875 would increase the minimum wage in Minnesota to $7.75,
giving Minnesota the 7th-highest minimum wage in the country. The size of this wage mandate and
the lack of an appropriate tip credit would detrimentally harm employers in Minnesota struggling to
maintain jobs within an economic slowdown and ultimately be passed on to consumers in the form
of increased prices for goods and services.
I am willing to consider a bipartisan minimum wage bill next session if it allows for a reasonable
increase, creates a tip credit, and does not unduly burden Minnesota's employers and Minnesota's

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 319, Senate File 3775, a bill establishing a new fee on paint
sold in Minnesota.
County governments throughout Minnesota currently have well established programs to collect
and dispose of paint and various other household hazardous waste products. I support these efforts
to encourage consumer recycling and efforts by industry to make recycling easier for consumers.
Minnesotans currently support paint recycling and disposal programs through their state and local
taxes. I am vetoing this bill because it imposes a second government-imposed payment on Minnesota
consumers for this same purpose.
While counties and associated household hazardous waste programs may be seeing increased
burdens related to the collection and recycling of used paint, this legislation provides little
assurance that taxpayers will see any relief if this bill were to become law.
Requiring Minnesota consumers to pay for both public and industry based programs results in a
double burden on consumers for the same purpose. I appreciate that the conference committee
members considered some of the arguments made by opponents of the bill on this particular issue
and included language that remits excess funds collected by this fee to other household hazardous
waste programs. However, if a new fee is warranted, the bill should provide a direct mechanism to
reduce property tax collections now going to support paint recycling and disposal within household
hazardous waste programs.
To the extent state anti-trust laws prevent manufacturers and retailers from acting in concert to
establish such a program, rather than establish a new fee or assessment in legislation, the best
approach is to simply provide manufacturers the exemptions from anti-trust regulations needed to
develop and operate such a program.
                                                    Sincerely,
                                                    Tim Pawlenty, Governor

                                                                                       May 15, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear Senator Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 323, Senate File 3166. Provisions in the bill that weaken
the statutory criminal background check standards for people who have direct contact with children,
nursing home residents, and vulnerable adults are unacceptable. Provisions in the bill that remove
the right to confidentiality that was previously promised to birth parents who placed a child for
adoption are also problematic.
The criminal background check procedures for persons providing direct care to children and other
vulnerable populations were significantly strengthened during the 2005 legislative session. At that
time, the Legislature amended Minnesota Statutes, Section 245C.15, to expressly enumerate sex
offenses, predatory offenses such as murder, felony spousal and child abuse, child pornography,
and other serious felony offenses as permanent bars from employment providing direct services
to children and vulnerable adults. The bill also exempted these most serious of crimes from the
administrative set aside process. The protections afforded in H.F. 1, Chapter 136, passed both
chambers of the Legislature with broad bipartisan support. This bill compromises those protections.
I expressed my specific concerns on the criminal background check provisions in this bill in a letter
to the conference committee. It is unfortunate that my concerns were not addressed.
S.F. 3166 weakens the ability of the Department of Human Services to disqualify an individual
from direct contact services where a preponderance of the evidence supports the commission of a
disqualifying crime. This bill would invoke a higher evidentiary standard of "clear and convincing
evidence." The preponderance of evidence standard has been a workable standard for many years.
Requiring the agency to prove the conduct by a higher evidentiary standard will require the agency
to allow individuals, for whom there is significant and credible evidence of serious criminal conduct,
to work with children and other vulnerable individuals.
This bill also amends current law to allow individuals who were granted a set aside prior to July 1,
2005, to request another set aside despite their crime being included within the list of permanently
disqualifying crimes. This would permit over 400 offenders who committed very serious crimes
to potentially obtain a set aside to provide direct contact services to children and other vulnerable
individuals.
Finally, S.F. 3166 contains a provision to amend Section 245C.24 to expressly permit a set aside
for a person convicted of participating in a felony drive-by shooting, for the purpose of working
in a correctional facility. Felony drive-by shooting is rightfully identified as a crime that results
in a permanent disqualification. The serious and violent nature of the permanent disqualification
crimes is the reason why the Legislature identified them as offenses that result in a permanent
disqualification. It fundamentally undermines public policy to statutorily carve out an exception
for the purpose of satisfying the specific employment desires of a single constituent.
I am also concerned about this bill's amendment to current laws that afford privacy to birth parents
who placed a child for adoption before 1977. Under current law, birth parents are notified that birth
records eventually become accessible to the adopted child unless a birth parent files an affidavit
117TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, MAY 16, 2008                                      10317

opposing release of his or her personally identifying information. However, before 1977, adoption
records and the original birth record were sealed. Birth parents that placed a child for adoption were
promised that their information would be sealed and kept confidential.
Because of this promise of confidentiality, existing law has always treated pre-adoption birth
records from before 1977 with a presumption of confidentiality. For example, when the Legislature
established a procedure for an adopted person to request disclosure of the person's pre-adoption
birth record from the State Registrar, the procedure required notice of the request to the birth
parents and an opportunity for either parent to consent or object to the release of his or her
personally identifying information. If the birth parents could not be located, or objected to release,
a court review process was required for the disclosure of information.
This bill would erase the long-standing presumption of confidentiality for adoptions occurring
before 1977 and make those records accessible in the same manner as more recent adoptions.
Pre-adoption birth records and personally identifying information would be accessible to the
adopted child at age 19 unless the birth parent has affirmatively filed an affidavit opposing release.
This bill does not require notice to the pre-1977 birth parents, only posted notices on adoption
websites. Accordingly, pre-1977 birth parents are unlikely to receive any actual or meaningful
notice of the potential release of personally identifying information.
Although many birth parents may not object to the release of the pre-adoption birth certificate,
a significant number choose to preserve confidentiality. Statistics available from Lutheran Social
Services indicate that, on average, 23 percent of the birth mothers contacted declined to release
identifying information. Releasing this information without their knowledge or consent has the
potential to undermine the law and promises that existed for pre-1977 birth parents.
Additionally, this bill would allow release of birth records if the birth parent is deceased. This
eliminates any ability of the birth parent to maintain confidentiality and could impact surviving
family members.
Before 1977, the law supported a birth parent's expectation their identity and birth records would be
forever sealed and confidential. Breaching the promise of confidentiality previously given to these
birth parents is not appropriate. Any change to their legitimate expectation of confidentiality must
include meaningful notice of the change to the law and an opportunity to protect confidentiality.
The non-controversial child welfare and early childhood development provisions in this bill
(Articles 1 and 3) strengthen policies and supports for vulnerable children in our state and will help
Minnesota access federal funding. It is important that we work together to enact these provisions
as soon as possible. I hope the Legislature will act to pass these provisions before the end of the
2008 session, unencumbered by the controversial amendments.
                                                     Sincerely,

                                                                                        May 15, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 324, Senate File 1128, a bill that mandates expanded sick
leave benefits.
The ability of working family members to assist in care-giving is increasingly important. Many
private sector employers have largely acknowledged this position and have shifted away from the
use of "sick leave" and moved toward granting "personal time" off, which is not limited to sickness
and affords employees flexibility as to the reasons they take time off from work. This bill would not
apply to such employers.
Most government employers, however, are not unilaterally free to move toward personal time
policies. The terms and conditions of employment are established through collective bargaining
between government employers and the employee unions. For public sector employers, sick leave
and its usage should be left to the give and take of collective bargaining, not mandated by the state.
Local governments have opposed this bill because it is an unfunded mandate that expands sick
leave benefits outside of the collective bargaining process. To the extent language in the bill sought
to exempt employers, including the state or local governments, from full application of this bill's
mandate, the language does not appear to achieve this result.
State law generally trumps the provisions of policies or collective bargaining agreements. The
attempt to preserve the terms of labor agreements from the requirements of this bill is limited to
existing labor contracts. When the existing contracts expire, as they are required to under state
law, the full mandates of this bill would apply. This would have a significant fiscal impact on the
state and local governments. In addition, the existing contract terms are allowed to remain in effect
only if they allow use of sick leave for each of the mandated categories set forth in the bill. Most
existing contracts will not meet this narrow exemption and will be potentially subject to the full
mandate of the bill. If this is not the intent of the bill, the language is poorly drafted.
The bill's application to the state would trigger additional costs at a time when our budget is already
strained. The bill is also an unfunded mandate on local units of government, and it interferes with
collective bargaining. Mandating increased costs on public entities such as school districts and local
governments at this time is unwise.
For these reasons, I am vetoing this bill.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 1128 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 123B.143, subdivision 1, is amended to
read:
    Subdivision 1. Contract; duties. All districts maintaining a classified secondary school must
employ a superintendent who shall be an ex officio nonvoting member of the school board. The
authority for selection and employment of a superintendent must be vested in the board in all cases.
An individual employed by a board as a superintendent shall have an initial employment contract
for a period of time no longer than three years from the date of employment. Any subsequent
employment contract must not exceed a period of three years. A board, at its discretion, may or may
not renew an employment contract. A board must not, by action or inaction, extend the duration
of an existing employment contract. Beginning 365 days prior to the expiration date of an existing
employment contract, a board may negotiate and enter into a subsequent employment contract to
take effect upon the expiration of the existing contract. A subsequent contract must be contingent
upon the employee completing the terms of an existing contract. If a contract between a board and a
superintendent is terminated prior to the date specified in the contract, the board may not enter into
another superintendent contract with that same individual that has a term that extends beyond the
date specified in the terminated contract. A board may terminate a superintendent during the term
of an employment contract for any of the grounds specified in section 122A.40, subdivision 9 or
13. A superintendent shall not rely upon an employment contract with a board to assert any other
continuing contract rights in the position of superintendent under section 122A.40. Notwithstanding
the provisions of sections 122A.40, subdivision 10 or 11, 123A.32, 123A.75, or any other law to
the contrary, no individual shall have a right to employment as a superintendent based on order of
employment in any district. If two or more districts enter into an agreement for the purchase or
sharing of the services of a superintendent, the contracting districts have the absolute right to select
one of the individuals employed to serve as superintendent in one of the contracting districts and
no individual has a right to employment as the superintendent to provide all or part of the services

alternate achievement standards based on these academic standards for students with individualized
education plans as described under federal law.
    (e) A school district, no later than the 2007-2008 school year, must adopt graduation
requirements that meet or exceed state graduation requirements established in law or rule. A
school district that incorporates these state graduation requirements before the 2007-2008 school
year must provide students who enter the 9th grade in or before the 2003-2004 school year the
opportunity to earn a diploma based on existing locally established graduation requirements in
effect when the students entered the 9th grade. District efforts to develop, implement, or improve
instruction or curriculum as a result of the provisions of this section must be consistent with
sections 120B.10, 120B.11, and 120B.20.
   (f) The commissioner must include the contributions of Minnesota American Indian tribes and
communities as they relate to the academic standards during the review and revision of the required
academic standards.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment except that
paragraph (a), clause (5), applies to students entering the ninth grade in the 2009-2010 school year
and later.
     Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.021, subdivision 1a, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1a. Rigorous course of study; waiver. (a) Upon receiving a student's application signed
by the student's parent or guardian, a school district, area learning center, or charter school must
declare that a student meets or exceeds a specific academic standard required for graduation under
this section if the local school board, the school board of the school district in which the area learning
center is located, or the charter school board of directors determines that the student:
    (1) is participating in a course of study, including an advanced placement or international
baccalaureate course or program; a learning opportunity outside the curriculum of the district,
area learning center, or charter school; or an approved preparatory program for employment or
postsecondary education that is equally or more rigorous than the corresponding state or local
academic standard required by the district, area learning center, or charter school;
117TH DAY]                                  FRIDAY, MAY 16, 2008                                                10331

    (2) would be precluded from participating in the rigorous course of study, learning opportunity,
or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program if the student were required to
achieve the academic standard to be waived; and
   (3) satisfactorily completes the requirements for the rigorous course of study, learning
opportunity, or preparatory employment or postsecondary education program.
Consistent with the requirements of this section, the local school board, the school board of the
school district in which the area learning center is located, or the charter school board of directors
also may formally determine other circumstances in which to declare that a student meets or exceeds
a specific academic standard that the site requires for graduation under this section.
    (b) A student who satisfactorily completes a postsecondary enrollment options course or
program under section 124D.09, or an advanced placement or international baccalaureate course
or program under section 120B.13, is not required to complete other requirements of the academic
standards corresponding to that specific rigorous course of study.
    (c) A school board may exempt a student from the physical education graduation requirement
under section 120B.024, if the board declares that the student demonstrated mastery of the subject
matter or participation in another learning opportunity, including a Minnesota High School League
athletic activity, that meets or exceeds the physical education standards required for graduation. This
waiver does not reduce the total credits required for graduation.
    Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 120B.023, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Revisions and reviews required. (a) The commissioner of education must
revise and appropriately embed technology and information literacy standards consistent with
recommendations from school media specialists into the state's academic standards and graduation
requirements and implement a review cycle for state academic standards and related benchmarks,
consistent with this subdivision. During each review cycle, the commissioner also must examine
the alignment of each required academic standard and related benchmark with the knowledge and
skills students need for college readiness and advanced work in the particular subject area.
    (b) The commissioner in the 2006-2007 school year must revise and align the state's academic
standards and high school graduation requirements in mathematics to require that students
satisfactorily complete the revised mathematics standards, beginning in the 2010-2011 school year.
Under the revised standards:
    (1) students must satisfactorily complete an algebra I credit by the end of eighth grade; and
   (2) students scheduled to graduate in the 2014-2015 school year or later must satisfactorily
complete an algebra II credit or its equivalent.
The commissioner also must ensure that the statewide mathematics assessments administered to
students in grades 3 through 8 ­     an

    (1) uniform statewide testing of all students in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school level
that provides appropriate, technically sound accommodations, alternate assessments, or exemptions
consistent with applicable federal law, only with parent or guardian approval, for those very few
students for whom the student's individual education plan team under sections 125A.05 and 125A.06
determines that the general statewide test is inappropriate for a student, or for a limited English
proficiency student under section 124D.59, subdivision 2;
   (2) educational indicators that can be aggregated and compared across school districts and across
time on a statewide basis, including average daily attendance, high school graduation rates, and high
school drop-out rates by age and grade level;
   (3) state results on the American College Test; and
    (4) state results from participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress so that
the state can benchmark its performance against the nation and other states, and, where possible,
against other countries, and contribute to the national effort to monitor achievement.
   Subd. 1a. Statewide and local assessments; results. (a) The commissioner must develop
reading, mathematics, and science assessments aligned with state academic standards that districts
and sites must use to monitor student growth toward achieving those standards. The commissioner
must not develop statewide assessments for academic standards in social studies, health and
physical education, and the arts. The commissioner must require:
    (1) annual reading and mathematics assessments in grades 3 through 8 and at the high school
level for the 2005-2006 school year and later; and
    (2) annual science assessments in one grade in the grades 3 through 5 span, the grades 6 through
9 8 span, and a life sciences assessment in the grades ­

year and later.
     (b) The commissioner must ensure that all statewide tests administered to elementary and
secondary students measure students' academic knowledge and skills and not students' values,
attitudes, and beliefs.
   (c) Reporting of assessment results must:
    (1) provide timely, useful, and understandable information on the performance of individual
students, schools, school districts, and the state;
   (2) include, by no later than the 2008-2009 school year, a value-added component that is in
addition to a measure for student achievement growth over time; and
    (3)(i) for students enrolled in grade 8 before the 2005-2006 school year, determine whether
students have met the state's basic skills requirements; and
    (ii) for students enrolled in grade 8 in the 2005-2006 school year and later, determine whether
students have met the state's academic standards.
    (d) Consistent with applicable federal law and subdivision 1, paragraph (d), clause (1),
the commissioner must include appropriate, technically sound accommodations or alternative
assessments for the very few students with disabilities for whom statewide assessments are
inappropriate and for students with limited English proficiency.

proficiency in the context of the state's grade level academic standards. If a state assessment is not
available, a school, school district, and charter school must determine locally if a student has met
the required academic standards. A school, school district, or charter school may use a student's
performance on a statewide assessment as one of multiple criteria to determine grade promotion or
retention. A school, school district, or charter school may use a high school student's performance
on a statewide assessment as a percentage of the student's final grade in a course, or place a student's
assessment score on the student's transcript.
    Subd. 2. Department of Education assistance. The Department of Education shall contract for
professional and technical services according to competitive bidding procedures under chapter 16C
for purposes of this section.
    Subd. 3. Reporting. The commissioner shall report test data publicly and to stakeholders,
including the performance achievement levels developed from students' unweighted test scores
in each tested subject and a listing of demographic factors that strongly correlate with student
performance. The commissioner shall also report data that compares performance results among
school sites, school districts, Minnesota and other states, and Minnesota and other nations. The
commissioner shall disseminate to schools and school districts a more comprehensive report
containing testing information that meets local needs for evaluating instruction and curriculum.
    Subd. 4. Access to tests. The commissioner must adopt and publish a policy to provide public
and parental access for review of basic skills tests, Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments, or any
other such statewide test and assessment. Upon receiving a written request, the commissioner must
make available to parents or guardians a copy of their student's actual responses to the test questions

   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 122A.06, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction. (a) "Comprehensive,
scientifically based reading instruction" includes a program or collection of instructional practices
                 r­
that is based on ­e­i­­
                   l­a b­e
                        l­­, valid, replicated evidence showing that when these programs or practices
are used, students can be expected to achieve, at a minimum, satisfactory reading progress. The
program or collection of practices must include, at a minimum, instruction in five areas of reading:
phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and ­e    t­x­­
                                                                            t reading comprehension.
    Comprehensive, scientifically based reading instruction also includes and integrates
instructional strategies for continuously assessing, evaluating, and communicating the student's
reading progress and needs in order to design and implement ongoing interventions so that students
of all ages and proficiency levels can read and comprehend text and apply higher level thinking
skills.
    (b) "Phonemic awareness" is the ability of students to notice, think about, and manipulate the
individual sounds in spoken syllables and words.
    (c) "Phonics" is the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships between
written letters and spoken words. Phonics instruction is a way of teaching reading that stresses
learning how letters correspond to sounds and how to apply this knowledge in reading and spelling.
   (d) "Fluency" is the ability of students to be able to read orally with speed, accuracy, and proper
expression.
    (e) "Vocabulary development" is the process of teaching vocabulary both directly and indirectly,
with repetition and multiple exposures to vocabulary items. Learning in rich contexts, incidental
learning, and use of computer technology all enhance the acquisition of vocabulary.
    (f) "Reading comprehension" is an active process that requires intentional thinking during
which meaning is constructed through interactions between text and reader. Comprehension skills
are taught explicitly by demonstrating, explaining, modeling, and implementing specific cognitive
strategies to help beginning readers derive meaning by intentional, problem-solving thinking
processes.

board's discretion, assistance may include the application of chapter 14.
    (d) The board must provide the leadership and shall adopt rules for the redesign of teacher
education programs to implement a research based, results-oriented curriculum that focuses
on the skills teachers need in order to be effective. The board shall implement new systems of
teacher preparation program evaluation to assure program effectiveness based on proficiency
of graduates in demonstrating attainment of program outcomes. The board must require that
persons enrolled in a teacher preparation program receive instruction in historical and cultural
competencies related to Minnesota American Indian tribes and communities and their contributions
to Minnesota, consistent with sections 120B.021, subdivision 1, and 124D.71 to 124D.82. The

require colleges and universities offering a board approved teacher preparation program to provide
remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component to persons enrolled in their
institution who did not achieve a qualifying score on the skills examination or an assessment of
reading instruction, including those for whom English is a second language. The colleges and
universities must provide assistance in the specific academic areas of deficiency in which the
person did not achieve a qualifying score. School districts must provide similar, appropriate, and
timely remedial assistance that includes a formal diagnostic component and mentoring to those
persons employed by the district who completed their teacher education program outside the state
of Minnesota, received a one-year license to teach in Minnesota and did not achieve a qualifying
score on the skills examination, including those persons for whom English is a second language.

requirements of the enrolling district. An online learning provider must make available to the
enrolling district the course syllabus, standard alignment, content outline, assessment requirements,
and contact information for supplemental online courses taken by students in the enrolling district.
The enrolling district must apply the same graduation requirements to all students, including online
learning students, and must continue to provide nonacademic services to online learning students.
If a student completes an online learning course or program that meets or exceeds a graduation
standard or grade progression requirement at the enrolling district, that standard or requirement
is met. The enrolling district must use the same criteria for accepting online learning credits or
courses as it does for accepting credits or courses for transfer students under section 124D.03,
subdivision 9. The enrolling district may reduce the course schedule of an online learning student
in proportion to the number of online learning courses the student takes from an online learning

    (1) enroll in supplemental online learning courses during a single school year to a maximum of
50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term. A student may exceed the supplemental
online learning registration limit if the enrolling district grants permission for supplemental online
learning enrollment above the limit, or if an agreement is made between the enrolling district and
the online learning provider for instructional services;
      (2) complete course work at a grade level that is different from the student's current grade level;
and
    (3) enroll in additional courses with the online learning provider under a separate agreement that
includes terms for payment of any tuition or course fees.
    (c) An online learning student has the same access to the computer hardware and education
software available in a school as all other students in the enrolling district. An online learning
provider must assist an online learning student whose family qualifies for the education tax credit
under section 290.0674 to acquire computer hardware and educational software for online learning
purposes.
   (d) An enrolling district may offer online learning to its enrolled students. Such online learning
does not generate online learning funds under this section. Notwithstanding paragraph (e), an
enrolling district that offers online learning only to its enrolled students is not subject to the

requirements and review criteria under subdivision 7. A teacher with a Minnesota license must
assemble and deliver instruction to online learning students. The delivery of instruction occurs
when the student interacts with the computer or the teacher and receives ongoing assistance and
assessment of learning. The instruction may include curriculum developed by persons other than
a teacher with a Minnesota license. Unless the commissioner grants a waiver, a teacher providing
online learning instruction must not instruct more than 40 students in any one online learning
course or program.
    (f) To enroll in more than 50 percent of the student's full schedule of courses per term in online
learning, the student must qualify to exceed the supplemental online learning registration limit under
paragraph (b) or apply for enrollment to an approved full-time online learning program following
appropriate procedures in subdivision 3, paragraph (a). Full-time online learning students may enroll
in classes at a local school per contract for instructional services between the online learning provider
and the school district.

read:
      Subd. 7. Department of Education. (a) The department must review and certify online learning
providers. The online learning courses and programs must be rigorous, aligned with state academic
standards, and contribute to grade progression in a single subject. O                                         ­n ­­i

   Sec. 33. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 124D.10, subdivision 4, is amended to
read:
    Subd. 4. Formation of school. (a) A sponsor may authorize one or more licensed teachers under
section 122A.18, subdivision 1, to operate a charter school subject to approval by the commissioner.
A board must vote on charter school application for sponsorship no later than 90 days after receiving
the application. The school must be organized and operated as a cooperative under chapter 308A or
nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and the provisions under the applicable chapter shall apply
to the school except as provided in this section. Notwithstanding sections 465.717 and 465.719, a
school district may create a corporation for the purpose of creating a charter school.
    (b) Before the operators may form and operate a school, the sponsor must file an affidavit with
the commissioner stating its intent to authorize a charter school. The affidavit must demonstrate the
sponsor's abilities, capacities, and expertise in fulfilling the responsibilities of a sponsor and state the
terms and conditions under which the sponsor would authorize a charter school and how the sponsor
intends to oversee the fiscal and student performance of the charter school and to comply with the
terms of the written contract between the sponsor and the charter school board of directors under
subdivision 6 in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The sponsor must submit an
affidavit to the commissioner for each charter school it proposes to authorize. The commissioner
must approve or disapprove the sponsor's proposed authorization within 90 days of receipt of the
affidavit. Failure to obtain commissioner approval precludes a sponsor from authorizing the charter
school that was the subject of the affidavit.
    (c) The operators authorized to organize and operate a school, before entering into a contract
or other agreement for professional or other services, goods, or facilities, must incorporate as a
cooperative under chapter 308A or as a nonprofit corporation under chapter 317A and must establish
a board of directors composed of at least five nonrelated members until a timely election for members
of the charter school board of directors is held according to the school's articles and bylaws. A
charter school board of directors must be composed of at least five members. Any staff members
who are employed at the school, including teachers providing instruction under a contract with a

wishes to return, or February 1 of the calendar year in which the leave is scheduled to terminate.
Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and except for section 122A.46, subdivision 7,
the leave is governed by section 122A.46, including, but not limited to, reinstatement, notice of
intention to return, seniority, salary, and insurance.
   During a leave, the teacher may continue to aggregate benefits and credits in the Teachers'
Retirement Association account by paying both the employer and employee contributions

The retirement association may impose reasonable requirements to efficiently administer this
subdivision.
    Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.10, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Causes for nonrenewal or termination of charter school contract. (a) The duration
of the contract with a sponsor must be for the term contained in the contract according to subdivision
6. The sponsor may or may not renew a contract at the end of the term for any ground listed in
paragraph (b). A sponsor may unilaterally terminate a contract during the term of the contract for
any ground listed in paragraph (b). At least 60 days before not renewing or terminating a contract, the
sponsor shall notify the board of directors of the charter school of the proposed action in writing. The
notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action in reasonable detail and that the charter school's
board of directors may request in writing an informal hearing before the sponsor within 14 days of
receiving notice of nonrenewal or termination of the contract. Failure by the board of directors to
make a written request for a hearing within the 14-day period shall be treated as acquiescence to
the proposed action. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the sponsor shall give
reasonable notice to the charter school's board of directors of the hearing date. The sponsor shall
conduct an informal hearing before taking final action. The sponsor shall take final action to renew
or not renew a contract by the last day of classes in the school year. If the sponsor is a local board,
the school's board of directors may appeal the sponsor's decision to the commissioner.
    (b) A contract may be terminated or not renewed upon any of the following grounds:
    (1) failure to meet the requirements for pupil performance contained in the contract;
    (2) failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management;
    (3) violations of law; or
    (4) other good cause shown.
   If a contract is terminated or not renewed under this paragraph, the school must be dissolved
according to the applicable provisions of chapter 308A or 317A, except when the commissioner
approves the decision of a different eligible sponsor to authorize the charter school.
                                          e­t

     Subdivision 1. State technology guidelines; guideline setting. (a) Notwithstanding other
law to the contrary, the commissioner, the Minnesota Education Technology Task Force, and
representatives of school districts must work together to identify for school districts the robust
technology tools and systems that improve the educational achievement of all Minnesota
students. These entities must establish a foundation of flexible shared services that supports
state development and implementation of new and more efficient educational business practices,
including the use of modern analytical tools that help schools and school districts make data-driven
decisions and increase instructional time. These entities also must anticipate the needs of school
districts for effectively using emerging technologies to make the best and most cost-effective use
of finite educational resources.
    (b) The commissioner, the Minnesota Education Technology Task Force, representatives of
school districts, and other interested and affected stakeholders, must establish and then maintain,
revise, and publish every four years beginning December 1, 2008, state and district technology
guidelines consistent with the requirements of this section and section 120B.023, subdivision 2,
paragraph (a). The state and school districts must use the technology guidelines to participate in a
uniform data collection system premised on:
   (1) common data definitions for all required data elements;
   (2) a common course catalogue;
   (3) common transcript definitions; and
   (4) school district infrastructure technology guidelines.
    (c) School districts, consistent with this section and other applicable law, may use financial
resources in addition to state funding to provide students with the technology tools they need to
succeed in an increasingly complex and information-rich environment.
    Subd. 2. District technology guidelines. (a) The commissioner, in collaboration with the
Minnesota Education Technology Task Force, must establish and then maintain, revise, and publish
six categories of district technology guidelines consistent with this section. The district technology
guidelines must encompass:
   (1) instructional technology that includes best practices in 21st century classroom instruction
and student learning;
   (2) technological tools that support formative and summative online assessments, equipment,
and software;
   (3) shared services that facilitate network and data systems administration;
   (4) data practices that include technical security, Internet safety, and data privacy;
   (5) data management that facilitates efficient data transfers involving school districts and the
department; and

    (6) facilities infrastructure that supports multipurpose technology facilities for instruction and
assessment.
    (b) School districts are encouraged to align district technology expenditures with state and
district technology guidelines established under this section.
    (c) Beginning December 1, 2010, and each two-year period thereafter, school districts must use
the district technology guidelines in this section to complete a review of the district technology
environment that:
   (1) examines the alignment of district technology expenditures to the technology guidelines
under this section;
    (2) identifies service gaps in the district technology plan; and
    (3) estimates the funding needed to fill service gaps.
    (d) School districts must transmit the substance of the review to the commissioner in the
form and manner the commissioner determines in collaboration with the Minnesota Education
Technology Task Force. The commissioner must evaluate and report the substance of the reviews
to the legislature by February 15, 2011, and each two-year period thereafter.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment and applies to
the 2008-2009 school year and later.
    Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.40, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Lease purchase; installment buys. (a) Upon application to, and approval by, the
commissioner in accordance with the procedures and limits in subdivision 1, paragraphs (a) and
(b), a district, as defined in this subdivision, may:
    (1) purchase real or personal property under an installment contract or may lease real or personal
property with an option to purchase under a lease purchase agreement, by which installment contract
or lease purchase agreement title is kept by the seller or vendor or assigned to a third party as security
for the purchase price, including interest, if any; and
   (2) annually levy the amounts necessary to pay the district's obligations under the installment
contract or lease purchase agreement.
    (b) The obligation created by the installment contract or the lease purchase agreement must not
be included in the calculation of net debt for purposes of section 475.53, and does not constitute
debt under other law. An election is not required in connection with the execution of the installment
contract or the lease purchase agreement.
    (c) The proceeds of the levy authorized by this subdivision must not be used to acquire a facility
to be primarily used for athletic or school administration purposes.

   Sec. 45. [127A.70] MINNESOTA P-20 EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP.
    Subdivision 1. Establishment; membership. A P-20 education partnership is established to
create a seamless system of education that maximizes achievements of all students, from early
childhood through elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, while promoting the
efficient use of financial and human resources. The partnership shall consist of major statewide
educational groups or constituencies or noneducational statewide organizations with a stated
interest in P-20 education. The initial membership of the partnership includes the members serving
on the Minnesota P-16 Education Partnership and four legislators appointed as follows:
    (1) one senator from the majority party and one senator from the minority party, appointed by
the Subcommittee on Committees of the Committee on Rules and Administration; and
  (2) one member of the house of representatives appointed by the speaker of the house and one
member appointed by the minority leader of the house.
    The chair of the P-16 education partnership must convene the first meeting of the P-20
partnership. Prospective members may be nominated by any partnership member and new members
will be added with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the partnership. The partnership will
also seek input from nonmember organizations whose expertise can help inform the partnership's
work.
    Partnership members shall be represented by the chief executives, presidents, or other formally
designated leaders of their respective organizations, or their designees. The partnership shall meet
at least three times during each calendar year.
    Subd. 2. Powers and duties; report. The partnership shall develop recommendations to the
governor and the legislature designed to maximize the achievement of all P-20 students while
promoting the efficient use of state resources, thereby helping the state realize the maximum value
for its investment. These recommendations may include, but are not limited to, strategies, policies,
or other actions focused on:
   (1) improving the quality of and access to education at all points from preschool through the

graduate education;
     (2) improving preparation for, and transitions to, postsecondary education and work; and
   (3) ensuring educator quality by creating rigorous standards for teacher recruitment, teacher
preparation, induction and mentoring of beginning teachers, and continuous professional
development for career teachers.
    By January 15 of each year, the partnership shall submit a report to the governor and to the
chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction
over P-20 education policy and finance that summarizes the partnership's progress in meeting its
goals and identifies the need for any draft legislation when necessary to further the goals of the
partnership to maximize student achievement while promoting efficient use of resources.
   Subd. 3. Expiration. Notwithstanding section 15.059, subdivision 5, the partnership is
permanent and does not expire.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 125A.15, is amended to read:
   125A.15 PLACEMENT IN ANOTHER DISTRICT; RESPONSIBILITY.
    The responsibility for special instruction and services for a child with a disability temporarily
placed in another district for care and treatment shall be determined in the following manner:
    (a) The district of residence of a child shall be the district in which the child's parent resides, if
living, or the child's guardian, or the district designated by the commissioner if neither parent nor
guardian is living within the state.
    (b) If a district other than the resident district places a pupil for care and treatment, the district
placing the pupil must notify and give the resident district an opportunity to participate in the
placement decision. When an immediate emergency placement of a pupil is necessary and time
constraints foreclose a resident district from participating in the emergency placement decision, the
10362                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [117TH DAY

district in which the pupil is temporarily placed must notify the resident district of the emergency
placement within 15 days. The resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice
of the emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision,
which the placing district must then provide.
     (c) When a child is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day program located in another
district and the child continues to live within the district of residence during the care and treatment,
the district of residence is responsible for providing transportation to and from the care and treatment
f­
­a­ i­i
  c­l ­t
       ­y
        ­ program and an appropriate educational program for the child. The resident district may
establish reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the
child placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court or
agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during regular
operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the educational program
at a school within the district of residence, at the child's residence, or in the district in which the day
treatment center is located by paying tuition to that district.
    ­
    (­
     c­) (d) When a child is temporarily placed in a residential program for care and treatment,
the nonresident district in which the child is placed is responsible for providing an appropriate
educational program for the child and necessary transportation while the child is attending the
educational program; and must bill the district of the child's residence for the actual cost of
providing the program, as outlined in section 125A.11, except as provided in paragraph ­      (d
                                                                                               ­­

However, the board, lodging, and treatment costs incurred in behalf of a child with a disability
placed outside of the school district of residence by the commissioner of human services or the
commissioner of corrections or their agents, for reasons other than providing for the child's special
educational needs must not become the responsibility of either the district providing the instruction
or the district of the child's residence. For the purposes of this section, the state correctional
facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are considered to be residential programs for care and
treatment.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (e) A privately owned and operated residential facility may enter into a contract to obtain
appropriate educational programs for special education children and services with a joint powers
entity. The entity with which the private facility contracts for special education services shall be the
district responsible for providing students placed in that facility an appropriate educational program
in place of the district in which the facility is located. If a privately owned and operated residential
facility does not enter into a contract under this paragraph, then paragraph ­  (­
                                                                                 c­

    ­
    (­
     e­
      ) (f) The district of residence shall pay tuition and other program costs, not including
transportation costs, to the district providing the instruction and services. The district of residence
may claim general education aid for the child as provided by law. Transportation costs must be paid
by the district responsible for providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation
aid to that district.

or disability, must be determined as provided in this section.
   (a) The school district of residence of the pupil is the district in which the pupil's parent or
guardian resides.
    (b) When parental rights have been terminated by court order, the legal residence of a child
placed in a residential or foster facility for care and treatment is the district in which the child resides.
    (c) Before the placement of a pupil for care and treatment, the district of residence must be
notified and provided an opportunity to participate in the placement decision. When an immediate
emergency placement is necessary and time does not permit resident district participation in the
placement decision, the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed, if different from the district
of residence, must notify the district of residence of the emergency placement within 15 days of the
placement. When a nonresident district makes an emergency placement without first consulting with
the resident district, the resident district has up to five business days after receiving notice of the
emergency placement to request an opportunity to participate in the placement decision, which the
placing district must then provide.
    (d) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed for care and treatment in a day
program and the pupil continues to live within the district of residence during the care and
treatment, the district of residence must provide instruction and necessary transportation to and
from the care and treatment ­    f­

reasonable restrictions on transportation, except if a Minnesota court or agency orders the child
placed at a day care and treatment program and the resident district receives a copy of the order,
then the resident district must provide transportation to and from the program unless the court
or agency orders otherwise. Transportation shall only be provided by the resident district during
regular operating hours of the resident district. The resident district may provide the instruction at a
school within the district of residence, at the pupil's residence, or in the case of a placement outside
of the resident district, in the district in which the day treatment program is located by paying
tuition to that district. The district of placement may contract with a facility to provide instruction
by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
    (e) When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program for care
and treatment, the district in which the pupil is placed must provide instruction for the pupil and
necessary transportation while the pupil is receiving instruction, and in the case of a placement
outside of the district of residence, the nonresident district must bill the district of residence for the
actual cost of providing the instruction for the regular school year and for summer school, excluding
transportation costs.
    (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), if the pupil is homeless and placed in a public or private
homeless shelter, then the district that enrolls the pupil under section 127A.47, subdivision 2, shall
provide the transportation, unless the district that enrolls the pupil and the district in which the pupil
is temporarily placed agree that the district in which the pupil is temporarily placed shall provide
transportation. When a pupil without a disability is temporarily placed in a residential program
outside the district of residence, the administrator of the court placing the pupil must send timely
written notice of the placement to the district of residence. The district of placement may contract

with a residential facility to provide instruction by teachers licensed by the state Board of Teaching.
For purposes of this section, the state correctional facilities operated on a fee-for-service basis are
considered to be residential programs for care and treatment.
    (g) The district of residence must include the pupil in its residence count of pupil units and pay
tuition as provided in section 123A.488 to the district providing the instruction. Transportation costs
must be paid by the district providing the transportation and the state must pay transportation aid to
that district. For purposes of computing state transportation aid, pupils governed by this subdivision
must be included in the disabled transportation category if the pupils cannot be transported on a
regular school bus route without special accommodations.

year, the commissioner shall settle up with each school district in order to ensure that collections
from each district for departmental administrative costs are made on a pro rata basis according
to federal earnings for these services in each district. A school district is not eligible to enroll as
a home care provider or a personal care provider organization for purposes of billing home care
services under sections 256B.0651 and 256B.0653 to 256B.0656 until the commissioner of human

of eligible recipients during school hours. To use private duty nursing services or personal care
services at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care
plan identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school.

plan;
    (3) for special instruction and services provided to any pupil by contracting with public, private,
or voluntary agencies other than school districts, in place of special instruction and services provided
by the district, 52 percent of the difference between the amount of the contract and the general
education revenue, excluding basic skills revenue and alternative teacher compensation revenue, and
referendum equalization aid attributable to a pupil, calculated using the resident district's average
general education revenue and referendum equalization aid per adjusted pupil unit for the fraction
of the school day the pupil receives services under the contract. This includes children who are
residents of the state, receive services under this subdivision and subdivision 1, and are placed in a
care and treatment facility by court action in a state that does not have a reciprocity agreement with
the commissioner under section 125A.155 as provided for in section 125A.79, subdivision 8;
    (4) for special instruction and services provided to any pupil by contracting for services with
public, private, or voluntary agencies other than school districts, that are supplementary to a full
educational program provided by the school district, 52 percent of the amount of the contract for
that pupil;
    (5) for supplies and equipment purchased or rented for use in the instruction of children with a
disability, an amount equal to 47 percent of the sum actually expended by the district, or a Minnesota
correctional facility operating on a fee-for-service basis, but not to exceed an average of $47 in any
one school year for each child with a disability receiving instruction;
    (6) for fiscal years 1997 and later, special education base revenue shall include amounts under
clauses (1) to (5) for special education summer programs provided during the base year for that
fiscal year;
   (7) the cost of providing transportation services for children with disabilities under section
123B.92, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), clause (4); and
   (8) the district's transition-disabled program initial aid according to section 124D.454,
subdivision 3.
    The department shall establish procedures through the uniform financial accounting and
reporting system to identify and track all revenues generated from third-party billings as special
education revenue at the school district level; include revenue generated from third-party billings
as special education revenue in the annual cross-subsidy report; and exclude third-party revenue
from calculation of excess cost aid to the districts.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2008.

     Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 124D.522, is amended to read:
     124D.522 ADULT BASIC EDUCATION SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE GRANTS.
    (a) The commissioner, in consultation with the policy review task force under section 124D.521,
may make grants to nonprofit organizations to provide services that are not offered by a district
adult basic education program or that are supplemental to either the statewide adult basic education
program, or a district's adult basic education program. The commissioner may make grants for:
staff development for adult basic education teachers and administrators; training for volunteer
tutors; training, services, and materials for serving disabled students through adult basic education
programs; statewide promotion of adult basic education services and programs; development and
dissemination of instructional and administrative technology for adult basic education programs;
programs which primarily serve communities of color; adult basic education distance learning
projects, including television instruction programs; and other supplemental services to support the
mission of adult basic education and innovative delivery of adult basic education services.
    (b) The commissioner must establish eligibility criteria and grant application procedures. Grants
under this section must support services throughout the state, focus on educational results for
adult learners, and promote outcome-based achievement through adult basic education programs.
Beginning in fiscal year 2002, the commissioner may make grants under this section from the state
total adult basic education aid set aside for supplemental service grants under section 124D.531. Up
to one-fourth of the appropriation for supplemental service grants must be used for grants for adult
basic education programs to encourage and support innovations in adult basic education instruction
and service delivery. A grant to a single organization cannot exceed $    ­1

total supplemental services aid. Nothing in this section prevents an approved adult basic education
program from using state or federal aid to purchase supplemental services."

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I am vetoing and returning Chapter 329, Senate File 2965, the 2008 Surrogacy Gestational Bill.
Surrogate arrangements and contracts are currently occurring in Minnesota without specific
statutory guidelines. This bill was controversial and there was bipartisan objection to the bill.
Although I agree that certain legal parameters may be needed, this bill raises some significant
ethical and public policy issues that have not been adequately addressed.
This bill expressly permits the hiring of women to serve as surrogate mothers. Compensation is not
limited in any manner to the payment of expenses related to the pregnancy. We should encourage
to the fullest extent possible surrogacy on the basis of donated services similar to how Minnesota
addresses donation of bone marrow and organ donation.
This bill is written primarily to protect the interests of intended parents. It does not create strong
protections for the surrogate mother. For example, the bill permits the intended parents to include
contracts terms that place restrictive controls over the surrogate mother and grants the courts
authority to enforce those terms through injunctive relief and the award of monetary damages.
The bill also does not provide sufficient control to remain with the surrogate mother through the
pregnancy. For example, the bill allows the surrogate mother to choose her own physician, but only
with consultation with the intended parents. The bill fails to clearly identify the right of the surrogate
mother to make her own medical decisions during the pregnancy and permits contract provisions that
obligate the surrogate mother to undergo any medical treatments recommended by the physician.
Moreover, the bill fails to specifically grant the surrogate mother the right to refuse a request by the
intended parents to terminate the pregnancy. As currently drafted, it is not clear whether a surrogate
mother could refuse a request that she terminate the pregnancy. Even if the surrogate mother invokes
her constitutional rights to refuse medical treatment, that refusal would not necessarily protect her
from an award of damages or other remedies for breach of contract.
The bill also allows enforcement of contracts that allow the intended parents to restrict the surrogate
mother's activities. The only limit to this control is that the restrictions do not "unreasonably
117TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, MAY 16, 2008                                      10379

jeopardize the gestational carrier's own health." Given the remedies allowed in the bill for the
intended parents to use the courts to enjoin the surrogate mother's actions and award damages, the
threat of enforcement alone is coercive.
The bill also fails in any manner to recognize or protect the life and rights of the unborn child. The
unborn child is treated throughout the bill as a chattel, the rights over which are set and enforced
under the terms of a contract. Indeed, if a dispute arises under the contract or a breach occurs, the
courts are prevented from applying the normal "best interests of the child" standard for resolving
the dispute. Instead the courts are required to apply a contract standard to determine the "original
intent" of the contracting parties.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2965 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

                                                                                       May 16, 2008
The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Chapter 330, Senate File 3193. Provisions in this bill are similar to
the provisions in Chapter 323, which I previously vetoed. I repeat my concerns that this bill would
remove the right to confidentiality that was previously promised to birth parents who placed a child
for adoption.
I am concerned about this bill's changes to current laws that afford privacy to birth parents who
placed a child for adoption before 1977. Under current law, birth parents are notified that birth
records eventually become accessible to the adopted child unless a birth parent files an affidavit
opposing release of his or her personally identifying information. However, before 1977, adoption
records and the original birth record were sealed. Birth parents that placed a child for adoption were
promised that their information would be sealed and kept confidential.
Because of this promise of confidentiality, existing law has always treated pre-adoption birth
records from before 1977 with a presumption of confidentiality. For example, when the Legislature
established a procedure for an adopted person to request disclosure of the person's pre-adoption
birth record from the State Registrar, the procedure required notice of the request to the birth
parents and an opportunity for either parent to consent or object to the release of his or her
personally identifying information. If the birth parents could not be located, or objected to release,
a court review process was required for the disclosure of information.
This bill would erase the long-standing presumption of confidentiality for adoptions occurring
before 1977 and make those records accessible in the same manner as more recent adoptions.
Pre-adoption birth records and personally identifying information would be accessible to the
adopted child at age 19 unless the birth parent has affirmatively filed an affidavit opposing release.
This bill does not require notice to the pre-1977 birth parents, only posted notices on adoption
websites. Accordingly, pre-1977 birth parents are unlikely to receive any actual or meaningful
10380                             JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                               [117TH DAY

notice of the potential release of personally identifying information.
Although many birth parents may not object to the release of the pre-adoption birth certificate,
a significant number choose to preserve confidentiality. Statistics available from Lutheran Social
Services indicate that, on average, 23 percent of the birth mothers contacted declined to release
identifying information. Releasing this information without their knowledge or consent has the
potential to undermine the law and promises that existed for pre-1977 birth parents.
Before 1977, the law supported a birth parent's expectation their identity and birth records would be
forever sealed and confidential. Breaching the promise of confidentiality previously given to these
birth parents is not appropriate. Any change to their legitimate expectation of confidentiality must
include meaningful notice of the change to the law and an opportunity to protect confidentiality.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                     Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 3193 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

   Subd. 2. Eligible person. For purposes of this section, an eligible person is a person who:
   (1) was born on April 12, 1956;
   (2) was initially employed by the city of Maple Grove on February 16, 1988;
   (3) was employed as a full-time fire inspector by the fire-rescue department of the city of
Maple Grove, including daytime response to fire calls, with retirement coverage by the coordinated
program of the general employees retirement plan of the Public Employees Retirement Association,
on April 2, 1990; and
   (4) was transferred to retirement coverage by the public employees police and fire retirement
plan as a fire inspector by Maple Grove city council action on January 1, 1996.
    Subd. 3. Service credit transfer. (a) An eligible person, upon filing a written application as
prescribed by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association and upon
compliance with subdivisions 4 and 5, shall have service credit for the period from April 2, 1990,
to January 1, 1996, transferred from the coordinated program of the general employees retirement
plan to the public employees police and fire retirement plan on the first of the month next following
the receipt of the additional payments under subdivision 4.
    (b) Upon the transfer of service credit under paragraph (a), the service credit of the eligible
person in the coordinated program of the general employees retirement plan for the period from
April 2, 1990, to January 1, 1996, is forfeited and may not be subsequently restored under Minnesota
Statutes, section 353.35, or any other applicable provision of law.
    Subd. 4. Additional payment amounts. (a) Accompanying the written application under
subdivision 3, the eligible person shall include an additional member contribution payment for
the period from April 2, 1990, to January 1, 1996. The additional member contribution payment
amount is the difference between the member contribution rate under Minnesota Statutes, section
353.65, subdivision 2, and the member contribution rate under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.27,
subdivision 2, applied to the eligible person's total covered salary for the period from April 2, 1990,
to January 1, 1996, plus annual compound interest from August 1, 1993, to the date on which the
payment is made at the rate of 8.5 percent.
    (b) Upon receipt of the additional member contributions under paragraph (a), the executive
director of the Public Employees Retirement Association shall notify the city of Maple Grove that
the payment was made and the amount of the additional employer contribution. Within 30 days of
the receipt of the notification from the Public Employees Retirement Association, the city of Maple
Grove shall pay the additional employer contribution amount. The amount is the difference between
the present value of the eligible person's combined retirement annuity from the coordinated program
of the general employees retirement plan and from the public employees police and fire retirement
plan as of the end of the month preceding the payment of the additional member contribution amount
and the present value of the potential retirement annuity from the public employees police and fire
retirement plan if the service credit transfer occurred as of the same date, reduced by the amount of
the retirement plan asset transfer under paragraph (c) and by the amount of the additional member
contribution amount. The present value computation must be made by the actuary retained under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.214, and must utilize the applicable actuarial assumptions under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.215. The additional employer contribution amount must be paid in
a lump sum. If the additional employer contribution payment is not made in a timely fashion, the
117TH DAY]                           FRIDAY, MAY 16, 2008                                      10387

executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association shall notify the commissioners
of finance and revenue of that fact and the commissioners shall deduct the required amount from
any state aid or other state payment amount applicable to the city, plus interest on the amount at the
rate of one percent per month from the payment due date to the actual payment date.
    (c) Upon the receipt of the additional member contribution under paragraph (a), the executive
director shall transfer an amount equal to double the eligible person's member contributions to the
coordinated program of the general employees retirement plan for the period from April 2, 1990, to
January 1, 1996, plus compound interest at the annual rate of 8.5 percent from August 1, 1993, to
the date of transfer from the general employees retirement fund to the public employees police and
fire retirement fund.
    Subd. 5. Public safety employment substantiation. Service credit is transferrable under this
section only if the employment for the city of Maple Grove by the eligible person during the period
from April 2, 1990, to January 1, 1996, is documented as constituting firefighter employment
sufficient to qualify for public employees police and fire retirement plan membership and eligibility
if the city of Maple Grove had adopted the resolution under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.64,
subdivision 2, as of April 2, 1990. The city of Maple Grove and the eligible person must provide
any relevant documentation required by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement
Association.
   Subd. 6. Expiration. Authority to transfer service credit under this section expires on July 1,
2009.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 4. TEACHERS RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION COVERAGE ELECTION FOR

   (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 354B,
an eligible person described in paragraph (b) may elect prospective and retroactive retirement
coverage under paragraph (c).
   (b) An eligible person is a person who:
   (1) was born on December 9, 1954;
    (2) was initially employed by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system on a
part-time basis at Metropolitan State University on January 12, 2004;
   (3) was first employed in excess of 25 percent of full-time employment by the Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities system on August 27, 2005;
    (4) was covered by the higher education individual retirement account plan because of a failure
of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system to advise about the default retirement
coverage provision of Minnesota Statutes, section 354B.21, subdivision 3; and
    (5) became a full-time employee of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system as a
full-time faculty member at Metropolitan State University on July 17, 2007.
    (c) An eligible person may elect retirement coverage by the Teachers Retirement Association
rather than the higher education individual retirement account plan for faculty employment rendered
10388                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

after the date of the retirement coverage election under this section and for past Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities system faculty employment from January 12, 2004, until the date of
the retirement coverage election. The election must be made in writing, must be filed with the
executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association, and must be accompanied with any
relevant documentation required by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association.
    (d) If an eligible person makes the retirement coverage election under paragraph (c), the eligible
person's member contributions to the higher education individual retirement account plan must be
transferred to the Teachers Retirement Association, with any earned investment returns on those
contributions. If the transferred member contributions and investment earnings are less than the
calculated amount of the member contribution that the eligible person would have made to the
Teachers Retirement Association on the eligible person's compensation from the Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities system for the period from August 27, 2005, to the date of the retirement
coverage election, if the person had been covered by the Teachers Retirement Association during
the period, plus annual compound interest at the rate of 8.5 percent, the eligible person shall pay the
balance of that calculated member contribution obligation within 30 days of the retirement coverage
election. Any payment may be made through an institution-to-institution transfer from the eligible
person's account in the Minnesota state deferred compensation program or the eligible person's
tax-sheltered savings account under the federal Internal Revenue Code, section 403(b).
    (e) Upon the transfer of the equivalent member contribution amount and any additional payments
under paragraph (d), the balance of the eligible person's higher education individual retirement
account plan account must be transferred to the Teachers Retirement Association. If the amounts
under paragraph (d) and the higher education individual retirement account plan account balance
under this paragraph are less than the prior service credit purchase payment amount calculated under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.551, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system shall pay
that difference within 60 days of the retirement coverage election date.
    (f) Upon the transfers and payments under paragraphs (d) and (e), the eligible person must be
credited by the Teachers Retirement Association with allowable and formula service for Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities system employment since January 12, 2004.
    (g) The authority to make a retirement coverage election under this section expires on January
1, 2009.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 5. TEACHERS RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION; SERVICE CREDIT PURCHASE
AUTHORIZATION.
    (a) Notwithstanding any provision of Minnesota Statutes, chapter 354, to the contrary, an
eligible person described in paragraph (b) may purchase allowable and formula service credit
under Minnesota Statutes, section 354.05, subdivisions 13 and 25, from the Teachers Retirement
Association, for the period of prior out-of-state teaching service specified in paragraph (c), by
making the payment required under paragraph (d).
   (b) An eligible person is a person who:
   (1) was born on April 7, 1976;
   (2) was a teacher at the Edwardsville High School in O'Fallon, Illinois, during the 1998-1999,

1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002 school years;
   (3) was a teacher for Independent School District No. 196, Rosemount, at the Apple Valley High
School during the 2002-2003, 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2006, and 2006-2007 school years; and
   (4) was on a leave of absence from Independent School District No. 196, Rosemount, for the
2007-2008 school year.
     (c) The period of prior service credit available for purchase is up to 4.188 years, representing
Illinois teaching service rendered during the 1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2000-2001, and 2001-2002
school years. The prior service credit may not exceed one year of service credit in any school year
and may not include any prior teaching service that entitles the eligible person to a current or deferred
age and service retirement annuity or disability benefit from the Illinois Teachers Retirement System
or that was previously subject to a prior service credit purchase from another defined benefit public
employee retirement plan.
    (d) The purchase payment amount under this section is the amount calculated under Minnesota
Statutes, section 356.551. If permitted by federal law and Illinois state law, the purchase payment
obligation may be met in whole or in part by an institution-to-institution transfer of the eligible
person's account balance in the Illinois Teachers Retirement System.
    (e) The election to purchase prior service credit under this section must be made in writing and
must be filed with the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association. The executive
director of the Teachers Retirement Association may require the documentation of the applicability

which are duly listed as herein provided, shall not be deemed to be vehicles using the public streets

from points outside or within the state to the place of business or storage of a licensed dealer within
the state or solely for the purpose of moving it from the place of business of a manufacturer, or
licensed dealer within the state to the place of business or residence of a purchaser outside the state,
shall not be deemed to be using the public streets or highways in the state within the meaning of this
chapter or of the Constitution of the state of Minnesota, article XIV, and shall not be held to make
the motor vehicle subject to taxation under this chapter as one using the public streets or highways,

taxation as personal property, and pay the license fee and tax thereon for the full calendar year as
one using the public streets and highways, and thereafter such vehicle shall be deemed to be one
using the public streets and highways and shall not be subject to assessment or taxation as personal

property at any time using the public streets.

    Subd. 5. Driving left of roadway center; exception. (a) No vehicle shall be driven to the left
side of the center of the roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance
ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering with the safe
operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken. In every
event the overtaking vehicle must return to the right-hand side of the roadway before coming within
100 feet of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.
    (b) Except on a one-way roadway or as provided in paragraph (c), no vehicle shall, in overtaking
and passing another vehicle or at any other time, be driven to the left half of the roadway under the

intersection within a city, or intersection outside of a city if the presence of the intersection is
marked by warning signs; or
   (3) where official signs are in place prohibiting passing, or a distinctive centerline is marked,
which distinctive line also so prohibits passing, as declared in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices adopted by the commissioner.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.446, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Driver training programs. The commissioner of public safety shall adopt rules
requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of thorough instruction concerning section 169.444 for
persons enrolled in driver training programs offered at public, private and parochial schools, and
commercial driver training schools. The instruction must encompass at least the responsibilities of
drivers, the content and requirements of section 169.444, and the penalties for violating that section.
   Sec. 38. [169.475] USE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE.
    Subdivision 1. Definition. For purposes of this section, "electronic message" means a
self-contained piece of digital communication that is designed or intended to be transmitted
between physical devices. An electronic message includes, but is not limited to, e-mail, a text
message, an instant message, a command or request to access a World Wide Web page, or other data
that uses a commonly recognized electronic communications protocol. An electronic message does
not include voice or other data transmitted as a result of making a phone call, or data transmitted
automatically by a wireless communications device without direct initiation by a person.
   Subd. 2. Prohibition on use. No person may operate a motor vehicle while using a wireless
communications device to compose, read, or send an electronic message, when the vehicle is in
motion or a part of traffic.
   Subd. 3. Exceptions. This section does not apply if a wireless communications device is used:
   (1) solely in a voice-activated or other hands-free mode;
   (2) for making a cellular phone call;
    (3) for obtaining emergency assistance to (i) report a traffic accident, medical emergency, or
serious traffic hazard, or (ii) prevent a crime about to be committed;
   (4) in the reasonable belief that a person's life or safety is in immediate danger; or
   (5) in an authorized emergency vehicle while in the performance of official duties.
   Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 169.67, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Trailer, semitrailer. (a) No trailer or semitrailer with a gross vehicle weight of 3,000
or more pounds, or a gross weight that exceeds the empty weight of the towing vehicle, may be
drawn on a highway unless it is equipped with brakes that are adequate to control the movement
of and to stop and hold the trailer or semitrailer. A surge brake on a trailer or semitrailer meets the
requirement of this paragraph for brakes adequate to stop and hold the trailer or semitrailer.

otherwise operating, a cellular or wireless telephone, whether handheld or hands free, when the
vehicle is in motion. The provisional license holder may assert as an affirmative defense that the
violation was made for the sole purpose of obtaining emergency assistance to prevent a crime about
to be committed, or in the reasonable belief that a person's life or safety was in danger. Violation of
this paragraph is a petty misdemeanor subject to section 169.89, subdivision 2.

    (2) develop, adopt, revise, and monitor a statewide transportation plan, taking into account the
suggestions and information submitted at the public hearings held pursuant to clause (1). The plan
shall incorporate all modes of transportation and provide for the interconnection and coordination
of different modes of transportation. The commissioner shall evaluate alternative transportation
programs and facilities proposed for inclusion in the plan in terms of economic costs and benefits,
safety aspects, impact on present and planned land uses, environmental effects, energy efficiency,
national transportation policies and priorities, and availability of federal and other financial
assistance;
    (3) based upon the statewide transportation plan, develop statewide transportation priorities
and schedule authorized public capital improvements and other authorized public transportation
expenditures pursuant to the priorities. As permitted by the federal surface transportation program
and subject to available funding, the commissioner shall give serious consideration to prioritizing
for funding those trunk highway projects in the metropolitan area, as defined in section 473.121,
subdivision 2, that are consistent with policies included in the Metropolitan Council's metropolitan
development guide, transportation policy plan, and regional development framework, and that
have been awarded funding through the federal surface transportation program. In responding to
an unforeseen, catastrophic event affecting the state transportation system, the commissioner may,
upon written notification to the chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees with
jurisdiction over transportation policy and finance, prioritize projects without regard to availability
of federal funding; and
   (4) complete the plan and priorities required by this subdivision no later than July 1, 1978. Upon
completion of the plan and priorities, the commissioner shall prepare and periodically revise, as
necessary, the schedule of authorized public transportation expenditures. The plan, priorities, and
schedule are exempt from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.

trucks for hire within this state, nor may a common carrier by rail be permitted to own, lease, operate,
control, or have an interest in a permit carrier by truck, either by stock ownership or otherwise,

    Subdivision 1. Petition. (a) Permits, except livestock permits, issued under section 221.121 may
be assigned or transferred but only upon the order of the commissioner approving the transfer or
assignment after notice and hearing.
      (b) The proposed seller and buyer or lessor and lessee of a permit, except for livestock carrier
permits, shall file a joint notarized petition with the commissioner setting forth the name and address
of the parties, the identifying number of the permit, and the description of the authority which the
parties seek to sell or lease, a short statement of the reasons for the proposed sale or lease, a statement
of outstanding claims of creditors which are directly attributable to the operation to be conducted
under the permit, a copy of the contract of sale or lease, and a financial statement with a balance
sheet and an income statement, if existent, of the buyer or lessee. If it appears to the commissioner,                     ­

   (c) The commissioner shall look to the substance of the transaction rather than the form. An
agreement for the transfer or sale of a permit must be reported and filed with the commissioner
within 30 days of the agreement.
    (d) If an authority to operate as a permit carrier is held by a corporation, a sale, assignment,
pledge, or other transfer of the stock interest in the corporation which will accomplish a substantial
or material change or transfer of the majority ownership of the corporation, as exercised through its
stockholders, must be reported in the manner prescribed in the rules of the commissioner within 30
days after the sale, assignment, pledge, or other transfer of stock. The commissioner shall then make
a finding whether or not the stock transfer does, in fact, constitute a sale, lease, or other transfer of
the permit of the corporation to a new party or parties and, if they so find, then the continuance of the
permit issued to the corporation may only be upon the corporation's complying with the standards
and procedures otherwise imposed by this section.

10440                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                [117TH DAY

   Section 1. [219.501] RAIL CARRIER WALKWAYS.
   Subdivision 1. Duty to provide walkways. (a) Rail carriers must provide walkways adjacent to
those portions of yard tracks where rail carrier employees frequently work on the ground performing
switching activities. For purposes of this section, "frequently work" means at least five days per
week, one shift per day.
    (b) This section applies to reconstruction and new construction of yard track completed after
July 1, 2008.
    (c) This section does not apply to an entity that owns or operates track in this state other than
class one and class two rail carriers as classified by the Federal Railroad Administration.
    Subd. 2. General requirements. (a) Walkways constructed pursuant to this section may be
surfaced with asphalt, concrete, planking, grating, native material, crushed material, or other similar
nonrevenue material. When crushed material is used, 100 percent of the material must be capable
of passing through a 1-1/2-inch square sieve opening, and at least 90 percent of the material must
be capable of passing through a one-inch square sieve opening provided, however, a de minimus
variation is not a violation of this section where the rail carrier has made a good faith effort to
comply with the percentage requirements. Smaller crushed material is preferable, where drainage
and durability issues do not arise. Material that is three-quarter inch or less in size is recommended
for switching lead tracks.
   (b) Walkways must have a reasonably uniform surface and must be maintained in a safe condition
without compromising track drainage.
   (c) Cross slopes for walkways must not exceed one inch of elevation for each eight inches of
horizontal length in any direction.
   (d) Walkways must be a minimum width of two feet.
   (e) Walkways regulated under this section must be kept reasonably clear of spilled fuel, oil, sand,
posts, rocks, and other hazards or obstructions.
    Subd. 3. Allowances for unusual conditions. Rail carriers are not required to comply with the
requirements of this section during (1) maintenance activities or any period of heavy rain or snow,
derailments, rock and earth slides, washouts, and similar weather or seismic conditions, and (2)
during a reasonable period after any occurrences identified in clause (1) in order to allow a return
to compliance.
    Subd. 4. Waiver of requirements. Upon written request of a rail carrier, the commissioner may
waive any portion of this section where conditions do not reasonably allow compliance. A decision
of the commissioner is subject to the requirements under section 218.041.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 219.51, is amended to read:

                              e Violation. A common carrier, corporation, or person subject to
sections 219.45 to 219.53 violating any of the provisions of those sections, is liable to a penalty of
not more than $500 for each violation.

    Subd. 2. Failure to correct. If a common carrier, person, or corporation (1) fails to correct a
violation of sections 219.45 to 219.53 when ordered by the commissioner of transportation within
the time provided in the order, and (2) does not appeal the order, then failure to correct the violation
as ordered by the commissioner constitutes a new and separate offense distinct from the original
