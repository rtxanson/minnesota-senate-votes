   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. In the case of taxing
authorities required to hold a public meeting under subdivision 6, the notice must clearly state that
each taxing authority, including regional library districts established under section 134.201, and
including the metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), but excluding all other special
taxing districts and towns, will hold a public meeting to receive public testimony on the proposed
budget and proposed or final property tax levy, or, in case of a school district, on the current budget
and proposed property tax levy. It must clearly state the time and place of each taxing authority's
meeting, a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions
related to the notice, and an address where comments will be received by mail.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly

inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, ­ht­­

the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St.
Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under section 134.07 may be listed separately from the
remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal
disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured
value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity subject to the areawide tax must each be stated
separately and not included in the sum of the special taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.

   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.
    (i) For purposes of this subdivision, subdivisions 5a and 6, "metropolitan special taxing districts"

included with the appropriate county's levy and shall be discussed at that county's public hearing.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;
   (2) population growth and decline;

   The information may be presented using tables, written narrative, and graphic representations
and may contain instruction toward further sources of information or opportunity for comment.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
The Honorable Margaret Anderson Kelliher
Speaker of the House of Representatives
   We, the undersigned conferees for S.F. No. 1302 report that we have agreed upon the items in
5488                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [72ND DAY

dispute and recommend as follows:
   That the House recede from its amendment and that S.F. No. 1302 be further amended as follows:
   Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 15.99, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Deadline for response. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, section
462.358, subdivision 3b, or 473.175, or chapter 505, and notwithstanding any other law to the
contrary, an agency must approve or deny within 60 days a written request relating to zoning, septic
systems, watershed district review, soil and water conservation district review, or expansion of the
metropolitan urban service area for a permit, license, or other governmental approval of an action.
Failure of an agency to deny a request within 60 days is approval of the request. If an agency denies
the request, it must state in writing the reasons for the denial at the time that it denies the request.
    (b) When a vote on a resolution or properly made motion to approve a request fails for any
reason, the failure shall constitute a denial of the request provided that those voting against the
motion state on the record the reasons why they oppose the request. A denial of a request because
of a failure to approve a resolution or motion does not preclude an immediate submission of a same
or similar request.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b), if an agency, other than a multimember governing body,
denies the request, it must state in writing the reasons for the denial at the time that it denies the
request. If a multimember governing body denies a request, it must state the reasons for denial
on the record and provide the applicant in writing a statement of the reasons for the denial. If the
written statement is not adopted at the same time as the denial, it must be adopted at the next meeting
following the denial of the request but before the expiration of the time allowed for making a decision
under this section. The written statement must be consistent with the reasons stated in the record at
the time of the denial. The written statement must be provided to the applicant upon adoption.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.175, is amended to read:

                        ­ 473.851 to 473.871, to determine their compatibility with each other and
conformity with metropolitan system plans. The council shall review and comment on the apparent
consistency of the comprehensive plans with adopted plans of the council. The council may require
a local governmental unit to modify any comprehensive plan or part thereof if, upon the adoption
of findings and a resolution, the council concludes that the plan is more likely than not to have
a substantial impact on or contain a substantial departure from metropolitan system plans. A
local unit of government may challenge a council action under this subdivision by following the
procedures set forth in section 473.866.

a local governmental unit, unless a time extension is mutually agreed to, the council shall return to
the local governmental unit a statement containing its comments and, by resolution, its decision, if
any, to require modifications to assure conformance with the metropolitan system plans.

      No action shall be taken by any local governmental unit to place any such comprehensive plan
or part thereof into effect until the council has returned the statement to the unit and until the local
governmental unit has incorporated any modifications in the plan required by a final decision, order,

       473.851 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
    The legislature finds and declares that the local governmental units within the metropolitan area
are interdependent, that the growth and patterns of urbanization within the area create the need
for additional state, metropolitan and local public services and facilities and increase the danger
of air and water pollution and water shortages, and that developments in one local governmental
unit may affect the provision of regional capital improvements for sewers, transportation, airports,
water supply, and regional recreation open space. Since problems of urbanization and development
transcend local governmental boundaries, there is a need for the adoption of coordinated plans,
programs and controls by all local governmental units in order to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the metropolitan area and to ensure coordinated, orderly and economic
development. Therefore, it is the purpose of sections 462.355, ­­­

inquire in person about the funeral goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services
or prices offered by the funeral provider. The funeral provider must give the list upon beginning
discussion of either the prices of or the overall type of funeral service or disposition or specific
funeral goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services offered by the provider. This
requirement applies whether the discussion takes place in the funeral establishment or elsewhere.
However, when the deceased is removed for transportation to the funeral establishment, an in-person
request for authorization to embalm does not, by itself, trigger the requirement to offer the general
price list. If the provider, in making an in-person request for authorization to embalm, discloses that
embalming is not required by law except in certain special cases, the provider is not required to offer
the general price list. Any other discussion during that time about prices or the selection of funeral
goods, funeral services, burial site goods, or burial site services triggers the requirement to give the
consumer a general price list. The general price list must contain the following information:

     ­­) Upon receiving actual notice of the death of an individual with whom a funeral provider
has entered a preneed funeral agreement, the funeral provider must provide a copy of all preneed
funeral agreement documents to the person who controls final disposition of the human remains or
to the designee of the person controlling disposition. The person controlling final disposition shall
be provided with these documents at the time of the person's first in-person contact with the funeral
provider, if the first contact occurs in person at a funeral establishment, crematory, or other place
of business of the funeral provider. If the contact occurs by other means or at another location, the
documents must be provided within 24 hours of the first contact.

      Subd. 4. Casket, alternate container, and cremation container sales; records; required
disclosures. Any funeral provider who sells or offers to sell a casket, alternate container, or
cremation container, or cremated remains container to the public must maintain a record of each
sale that includes the name of the purchaser, the purchaser's mailing address, the name of the
decedent, the date of the decedent's death, and the place of death. These records shall be open

seeking approval to embalm, the funeral provider must disclose that embalming is not required by
law except in certain circumstances; that a fee will be charged if a funeral is selected which requires
embalming, such as a funeral with viewing; and that no embalming fee will be charged if the family
selects a service which does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate burial.
     Sec. 39. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.80, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Advance directives and will of decedent. A person may direct the preparation
for, type, or place of that person's final disposition, either by oral or written instructions.
Arrangements made in advance of need with a funeral establishment must be in writing and dated,
signed, and notarized. The person or persons otherwise entitled to control the final disposition
under this chapter shall faithfully carry out the reasonable and otherwise lawful directions of the
decedent to the extent that the decedent has provided resources for the purpose of carrying out
the directions. If the instructions are contained in a will, they shall be immediately carried out,
regardless of the validity of the will in other respects or of the fact that the will may not be offered
for or admitted to probate until a later date, subject to other provisions of this chapter or any other
law of this state. This subdivision shall be administered and construed so that the reasonable and
lawful instructions of the decedent or the person entitled to control the final disposition shall be
faithfully and promptly performed.
     Sec. 40. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.80, subdivision 2, is amended to read:

required when:
    (1) legal and physical custody of the body is transferred;
    (2) a body is transported by public transportation; or

    Sec. 57. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.93, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Retention of certificate of removal. A copy of the certificate of removal shall be
retained by the funeral establishment or representative of the legal entity releasing legal and physical
custody of the body. The original certificate of removal shall accompany the remains to the legal
entity to which custody is transferred. The funeral establishment releasing the custody of the remains
shall retain a copy of the certificate of removal for a period of three calendar years following the date
of the transfer of custody. Following this period, and subject to any other laws requiring retention of
records, the funeral establishment may then place the records in storage or reduce them to microfilm,
microfiche, laser disc, or any other method that can produce an accurate reproduction of the original
record, for retention for a period of ten calendar years from the date of the removal of the body.
At the end of this period and subject to any other laws requiring retention of records, the funeral
establishment may destroy the records by shredding, incineration, or any other manner that protects
the privacy of the individuals identified in the records.
    Sec. 58. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.93, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Disposition permit. A disposition permit is required before a body can be buried,
entombed, or cremated. No disposition permit shall be issued until a fact of death record has been
completed and filed with the local or state registrar of vital statistics.
    Sec. 59. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.93, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Possession of permit. Until the body is delivered for final disposition, the disposition
permit shall be in possession of the person in physical or legal custody of the body, or attached to the
transportation container which holds the body. At the place of final disposition, legal and physical
custody of the body shall pass with the filing of the disposition permit with the person in charge of
that place.
    Sec. 60. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 149A.93, subdivision 6, is amended to read:
    Subd. 6. Conveyances permitted for transportation. A dead human body may be transported
by means of public transportation provided that the body must be properly embalmed and encased
in an appropriate container, or by any private vehicle or aircraft that meets the following standards:
    (1) promotes respect for and preserves the dignity of the dead human body;

       (2) shields the body from being viewed from outside of the conveyance;
    (3) has ample enclosed area to accommodate a regulation ambulance cot, aircraft ambulance
stretcher, casket, alternative container, or cremation container in a horizontal position;
   (4) is designed to permit loading and unloading of the body without excessive tilting of the
casket, alternative container, or cremation container; ­

    (5) if used for the transportation of more than one dead human body at one time, the vehicle must
be designed so that a body or container does not rest directly on top of another body or container and
that each body or container is secured to prevent the body or container from excessive movement
within the conveyance; and
       (6) is designed so that the driver and the dead human body are in the same cab.

for dissection pursuant to section 525.9213, those delivered for anatomical study pursuant to
section 149A.81, subdivision 2, or lawfully carried through the state for the purpose of disposition
elsewhere; and the remains of any dead human body after dissection or anatomical study, shall

disposition of a body will not be accomplished within 72 hours following death or release of
the body by a competent authority with jurisdiction over the body, the body must be properly
embalmed or refrigerated. A body may not be kept in refrigeration for a period exceeding six
calendar days from the time of death or release of the body from the coroner or medical examiner.

from the body. No dead human body shall be removed from the container in which it is delivered
to the crematory without express written authorization of the person or persons with legal right to
control the disposition and only by a licensed mortician. If, after accepting delivery of a body for
cremation, it is discovered that the body contains an implanted mechanical or radioactive device,

with the express written permission of the person with legal right to control the final disposition or
otherwise provided by law, no crematory shall mechanically process the cremated human remains
of more than one body at a time in the same mechanical processor, or introduce the cremated human
remains of a second body into a mechanical processor until processing of any preceding cremated
human remains has been terminated and reasonable efforts have been employed to remove all
fragments of the preceding cremated remains. The fact that there is incidental and unavoidable
residue in the mechanical processor or any container used in a prior cremation is not a violation
of this provision.

facility with x-ray equipment for use on humans that is registered under subdivision 1 may not
operate, nor may the facility allow the individual to operate, x-ray equipment unless the individual
has passed a national examination for limited x-ray machine operators that meets the requirements
of paragraphs (b) and (c) and is approved by the commissioner of health.
    (b) The commissioner shall establish criteria for the approval of examinations based on national
standards, such as the examination in radiography from the American Registry of Radiologic
Technologists, the examination for limited scope of practice in radiography from the American
Registry of Radiologic Technologists for limited x-ray machine operators, and the American
Registry of Chiropractic Radiography Technologists for limited radiography in spines and
extremities; or equivalent examinations approved by other states. Equivalent examinations may be
approved by the commissioner, if the examination is consistent with the standards for educational
and psychological testing as recommended by the American Education Research Association, the
American Psychological Association, the National Council on Measurement in Education, or the
National Commission for Certifying Agencies. The organization proposing the use of an equivalent
examination shall submit a fee to the commissioner of $1,000 per examination to cover the cost of
determining the extent to which the examination meets the examining standards. The collected fee
shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the state government special revenue fund.

   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.121, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5b. Variance of scope of practice. The commissioner may grant a variance according
to Minnesota Rules, parts 4717.7000 to 4717.7050, to a facility for the scope of practice of an
x-ray operator in cases where the delivery of health care would otherwise be compromised if a
variance were not granted. The request for a variance must be in writing, state the circumstances that
constitute hardship, state the period of time the facility wishes to have the variance for the scope of
practice in place, and state the alternative measures that will be taken if the variance is granted. The

commissioner shall set forth in writing the reasons for granting or denying the variance. Variances
granted by the commissioner specify in writing the time limitation and required alternative measures
to be taken by the facility. A request for the variance shall be denied if the commissioner finds the
circumstances stated by the facility do not support a claim of hardship, the requested time period
for the variance is unreasonable, the alternative measures proposed by the facility are not equivalent
to the scope of practice, or the request for the variance is not submitted to the commissioner in a
timely manner.

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 148.10, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Grounds. (a) The state Board of Chiropractic Examiners may refuse to grant,
or may revoke, suspend, condition, limit, restrict or qualify a license to practice chiropractic, or
may cause the name of a person licensed to be removed from the records in the office of the court
administrator of the district court for:
   (1) Advertising that is false or misleading; that violates a rule of the board; or that claims the
cure of any condition or disease.
   (2) The employment of fraud or deception in applying for a license or in passing the examination
provided for in section 148.06 or conduct which subverts or attempts to subvert the licensing
examination process.
   (3) The practice of chiropractic under a false or assumed name or the impersonation of another
practitioner of like or different name.
   (4) The conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude.

    (5) The conviction, during the previous five years, of a felony reasonably related to the practice
of chiropractic.
   (6) Habitual intemperance in the use of alcohol or drugs.
   (7) Practicing under a license which has not been renewed.
   (8) Advanced physical or mental disability.
    (9) The revocation or suspension of a license to practice chiropractic; or other disciplinary action
against the licensee; or the denial of an application for a license by the proper licensing authority of
another state, territory or country; or failure to report to the board that charges regarding the person's
license have been brought in another state or jurisdiction.
    (10) The violation of, or failure to comply with, the provisions of sections 148.01 to 148.105,
the rules of the state Board of Chiropractic Examiners, or a lawful order of the board.
   (11) Unprofessional conduct.
    (12) Being unable to practice chiropractic with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reason
of illness, professional incompetence, senility, drunkenness, use of drugs, narcotics, chemicals or
any other type of material, or as a result of any mental or physical condition, including deterioration
through the aging process or loss of motor skills. If the board has probable cause to believe that
a person comes within this clause, it shall direct the person to submit to a mental or physical
examination. For the purpose of this clause, every person licensed under this chapter shall be
deemed to have given consent to submit to a mental or physical examination when directed in
writing by the board and further to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the examining
physicians' testimony or examination reports on the ground that the same constitute a privileged
communication. Failure of a person to submit to such examination when directed shall constitute
an admission of the allegations, unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the person's
control, in which case a default and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony
or presentation of evidence. A person affected under this clause shall at reasonable intervals be
afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that the person can resume the competent practice of
chiropractic with reasonable skill and safety to patients.
    In addition to ordering a physical or mental examination, the board may, notwithstanding section
13.384, 144.651, or any other law limiting access to health data, obtain health data and health
records relating to a licensee or applicant without the licensee's or applicant's consent if the board
has probable cause to believe that a doctor of chiropractic comes under this clause. The health
data may be requested from a provider, as defined in section 144.335, subdivision 1, paragraph
(b), an insurance company, or a government agency, including the Department of Human Services.
A provider, insurance company, or government agency shall comply with any written request of
the board under this subdivision and is not liable in any action for damages for releasing the data
requested by the board if the data are released pursuant to a written request under this subdivision,
unless the information is false and the provider or entity giving the information knew, or had reason
to believe, the information was false. Information obtained under this subdivision is classified as
private under sections 13.01 to 13.87.
    In any proceeding under this clause, neither the record of proceedings nor the orders entered by
the board shall be used against a person in any other proceeding.

    (13) Aiding or abetting an unlicensed person in the practice of chiropractic, except that it is not
a violation of this clause for a doctor of chiropractic to employ, supervise, or delegate functions to
a qualified person who may or may not be required to obtain a license or registration to provide
health services if that person is practicing within the scope of the license or registration or delegated
authority.
    (14) Improper management of health records, including failure to maintain adequate health
records as described in clause (18), to comply with a patient's request made under section 144.335
or to furnish a health record or report required by law.
    (15) Failure to make reports required by section 148.102, subdivisions 2 and 5, or to cooperate
with an investigation of the board as required by section 148.104, or the submission of a knowingly
false report against another doctor of chiropractic under section 148.10, subdivision 3.
   (16) Splitting fees, or promising to pay a portion of a fee or a commission, or accepting a rebate.
   (17) Revealing a privileged communication from or relating to a patient, except when otherwise
required or permitted by law.
    (18) Failing to keep written chiropractic records justifying the course of treatment of the patient,
including, but not limited to, patient histories, examination results, test results, and x-rays. Unless
otherwise required by law, written records need not be retained for more than seven years and x-rays
need not be retained for more than four years.
    (19) Exercising influence on the patient or client in such a manner as to exploit the patient or
client for financial gain of the licensee or of a third party which shall include, but not be limited to,
the promotion or sale of services, goods, or appliances.
   (20) Gross or repeated malpractice or the failure to practice chiropractic at a level of care, skill,
and treatment which is recognized by a reasonably prudent chiropractor as being acceptable under
similar conditions and circumstances.
    (21) Delegating professional responsibilities to a person when the licensee delegating such
responsibilities knows or has reason to know that the person is not qualified by training, experience,
or licensure to perform them.
    (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a), clause (2), conduct that subverts or attempts to subvert the
licensing examination process includes, but is not limited to: (1) conduct that violates the security
of the examination materials, such as removing examination materials from the examination
room or having unauthorized possession of any portion of a future, current, or previously
administered licensing examination; (2) conduct that violates the standard of test administration,
such as communicating with another examinee during administration of the examination, copying
another examinee's answers, permitting another examinee to copy one's answers, or possessing
unauthorized materials; or (3) impersonating an examinee or permitting an impersonator to take
the examination on one's own behalf.
    (c) For the purposes of paragraph (a), clauses (4) and (5), conviction as used in these subdivisions
includes a conviction of an offense that if committed in this state would be deemed a felony without
regard to its designation elsewhere, or a criminal proceeding where a finding or verdict of guilt is
made or returned but the adjudication of guilt is either withheld or not entered.

    (d) For the purposes of paragraph (a), clauses (4), (5), and (6), a copy of the judgment or
proceeding under seal of the administrator of the court or of the administrative agency which
entered the same shall be admissible into evidence without further authentication and shall
constitute prima facie evidence of its contents.
    (e) For the purposes of paragraph (a), clause (11), unprofessional conduct means any unethical,
deceptive or deleterious conduct or practice harmful to the public, any departure from or the failure
to conform to the minimal standards of acceptable chiropractic practice, or a willful or careless
disregard for the health, welfare or safety of patients, in any of which cases proof of actual injury
need not be established. Unprofessional conduct shall include, but not be limited to, the following
acts of a chiropractor:
      (1) gross ignorance of, or incompetence in, the practice of chiropractic;
    (2) engaging in conduct with a patient that is sexual or may reasonably be interpreted by the
patient as sexual, or in any verbal behavior that is seductive or sexually demeaning to a patient;
      (3) performing unnecessary services;
      (4) charging a patient an unconscionable fee or charging for services not rendered;
    (5) directly or indirectly engaging in threatening, dishonest, or misleading fee collection
techniques;
    (6) perpetrating fraud upon patients, third-party payors, or others, relating to the practice of
chiropractic, including violations of the Medicare or Medicaid laws or state medical assistance laws;
     (7) advertising that the licensee will accept for services rendered assigned payments from any
third-party payer as payment in full, if the effect is to give the impression of eliminating the need of
payment by the patient of any required deductible or co-payment applicable in the patient's health
benefit plan;  ­­o

     Sec. 37. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 148B.50, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Scope of practice. (a) The scope of practice of a licensed professional counselor
includes, but is not limited to:
    (1) the implementation of professional counseling treatment interventions including evaluation,
treatment planning, assessment, and referral;
     (2) direct counseling services to individuals, groups, and families;
     (3) counseling strategies that effectively respond to multicultural populations;

intervention.

persons listed in section 148B.592, or the performance of any act that licensed professional
counselors are not educated and trained to perform.

                               i­­, To be licensed as a licensed social worker, an applicant for licensure
by examination must provide evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant:
   (1) has received a baccalaureate degree in social work from a program accredited by the
Council on Social Work Education, the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work, or a
similar accreditation body designated by the board;
    (2) has passed the bachelors or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board. Unless an applicant applies
for licensure by endorsement pursuant to subdivision 7, an examination is not valid if it was taken
and passed eight or more years prior to submitting a completed, signed application form provided
by the board. The examination may be taken prior to completing degree requirements;
    (3) has submitted a completed, signed application form provided by the board, including the
applicable application fee specified in section 148D.180. For applications submitted electronically,
a "signed application" means providing an attestation as specified by the board;
   (4) has submitted the criminal background check fee and a form provided by the board
authorizing a criminal background check pursuant to subdivision 8;
    (5) has paid the applicable license fee specified in section 148D.180; and
   (6) has not engaged in conduct that was or would be in violation of the standards of practice
specified in sections 148D.195 to 148D.240. If the applicant has engaged in conduct that was or
would be in violation of the standards of practice, the board may take action pursuant to sections
148D.255 to 148D.270.
    (b) An application that is not completed and signed, or that is not accompanied by the correct
fee, must be returned to the applicant, along with any fee submitted, and is void.
    (c) A licensee granted a license by the board pursuant to paragraph (a) must meet the supervised
practice requirements specified in sections 148D.100 to 148D.125. If a licensee does not meet
the supervised practice requirements, the board may take action pursuant to sections 148D.255 to
148D.270.
   (d) By submitting an application for licensure, an applicant authorizes the board to investigate
any information provided or requested in the application. The board may request that the applicant
provide additional information, verification, or documentation.
    (e) Within one year of the time the board receives an application for licensure, the applicant
must meet all the requirements specified in paragraph (a) and must provide all of the information
requested by the board pursuant to paragraph (d). If within one year the applicant does not meet all
the requirements, or does not provide all of the information requested, the applicant is considered
ineligible and the application for licensure must be closed.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), an applicant may not take more than three times the
bachelors or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards, or a
similar examination body designated by the board. An applicant must receive a passing score on
the bachelors or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or
a similar examination body designated by the board in no more than 18 months after the date the

applicant first failed the examination.
   (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f), the board may allow an applicant to take, for a fourth or
subsequent time, the bachelors or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board if the applicant:
    (1) meets all requirements specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) other than passing the bachelors
or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a similar
examination body designated by the board;
    (2) provides to the board a description of the efforts the applicant has made to improve the
applicant's score and demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that the efforts are likely to improve
the score; and
    (3) provides to the board letters of recommendation from two licensed social workers attesting
to the applicant's ability to practice social work competently and ethically in accordance with
professional social work knowledge, skills, and values.
    (h) An individual must not practice social work until the individual passes the examination and
receives a social work license under this section or section 148D.060. If the board has reason to
believe that an applicant may be practicing social work without a license, and the applicant has failed
the bachelors or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or
a similar examination body designated by the board, the board may notify the applicant's employer
that the applicant is not licensed as a social worker.

for licensure by examination must provide evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant:
   (1) has received a graduate degree in social work from a program accredited by the Council
on Social Work Education, the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work, or a similar
accreditation body designated by the board;
    (2) has passed the masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board. Unless an applicant applies for
licensure by endorsement pursuant to section 148D.055, subdivision 7, an examination is not valid if
it was taken and passed eight or more years prior to submitting a completed, signed application form

provided by the board. The examination may be taken prior to completing degree requirements;
    (3) has submitted a completed, signed application form provided by the board, including the
applicable application fee specified in section 148D.180. For applications submitted electronically,
a "signed application" means providing an attestation as specified by the board;
   (4) has submitted the criminal background check fee and a form provided by the board
authorizing a criminal background check pursuant to subdivision 8;
   (5) has paid the applicable license fee specified in section 148D.180; and
   (6) has not engaged in conduct that was or would be in violation of the standards of practice
specified in sections 148D.195 to 148D.240. If the applicant has engaged in conduct that was or
would be in violation of the standards of practice, the board may take action pursuant to sections
148D.255 to 148D.270.
    (b) An application which is not completed and signed, or which is not accompanied by the correct
fee, must be returned to the applicant, along with any fee submitted, and is void.
    (c) A licensee granted a license by the board pursuant to paragraph (a) must meet the supervised
practice requirements specified in sections 148D.100 to 148D.125. If a licensee does not meet
the supervised practice requirements, the board may take action pursuant to sections 148D.255 to
148D.270.
   (d) By submitting an application for licensure, an applicant authorizes the board to investigate
any information provided or requested in the application. The board may request that the applicant
provide additional information, verification, or documentation.
    (e) Within one year of the time the board receives an application for licensure, the applicant
must meet all the requirements specified in paragraph (a) and must provide all of the information
requested by the board pursuant to paragraph (d). If within one year the applicant does not meet all
the requirements, or does not provide all of the information requested, the applicant is considered
ineligible and the application for licensure must be closed.
    (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), an applicant may not take more than three times the
masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board. An applicant must receive a passing score on
the masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or
a similar examination body designated by the board in no more than 18 months after the date the
applicant first failed the examination.
   (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f), the board may allow an applicant to take, for a fourth or
subsequent time, the masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board if the applicant:
    (1) meets all requirements specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) other than passing the masters
or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work boards or a similar
examination body designated by the board;
   (2) provides to the board a description of the efforts the applicant has made to improve the
applicant's score and demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that the efforts are likely to improve

the score; and
    (3) provides to the board letters of recommendation from two licensed social workers attesting
to the applicant's ability to practice social work competently and ethically in accordance with
professional social work knowledge, skills, and values.
    (h) An individual must not practice social work until the individual passes the examination and
receives a social work license under this section or section 148D.060. If the board has reason to
believe that an applicant may be practicing social work without a license, and the applicant has failed
the masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board, the board may notify the applicant's employer
that the applicant is not licensed as a social worker.

                             i­­, To be licensed as a licensed independent social worker, an applicant for
licensure by examination must provide evidence satisfactory to the board that the applicant:
   (1) has received a graduate degree in social work from a program accredited by the Council
on Social Work Education, the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work, or a similar
accreditation body designated by the board;
   (2) has practiced social work as defined in section 148D.010, and has met the supervised practice
requirements specified in sections 148D.100 to 148D.125;
    (3) has passed the advanced generalist or equivalent examination administered by the
Association of Social Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board. Unless
an applicant applies for licensure by endorsement pursuant to subdivision 7, an examination is
not valid if it was taken and passed eight or more years prior to submitting a completed, signed
application form provided by the board;
    (4) has submitted a completed, signed application form provided by the board, including the
applicable application fee specified in section 148D.180. For applications submitted electronically,
a "signed application" means providing an attestation as specified by the board;
   (5) has submitted the criminal background check fee and a form provided by the board
authorizing a criminal background check pursuant to subdivision 8;
72ND DAY]                            FRIDAY, MAY 18, 2007                                      5555

   (6) has paid the applicable license fee specified in section 148D.180; and
   (7) has not engaged in conduct that was or would be in violation of the standards of practice
specified in sections 148D.195 to 148D.240. If the applicant has engaged in conduct that was or
would be in violation of the standards of practice, the board may take action pursuant to sections
148D.255 to 148D.270.
    (b) An application which is not completed and signed, or which is not accompanied by the correct
fee, must be returned to the applicant, along with any fee submitted, and is void.
    (c) A licensed independent social worker who practices clinical social work must meet the
supervised practice requirements specified in sections 148D.100 to 148D.125. If a licensee does not
meet the supervised practice requirements, the board may take action pursuant to sections 148D.255
to 148D.270.
   (d) By submitting an application for licensure, an applicant authorizes the board to investigate
any information provided or requested in the application. The board may request that the applicant
provide additional information, verification, or documentation.
    (e) Within one year of the time the board receives an application for licensure, the applicant
must meet all the requirements specified in paragraph (a) and must provide all of the information
requested by the board pursuant to paragraph (d). If within one year the applicant does not meet all
the requirements, or does not provide all of the information requested, the applicant is considered
ineligible and the application for licensure must be closed.
     (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), an applicant may not take more than three times the
advanced generalist or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work
Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board. An applicant must receive a passing
score on the masters or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work
Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board in no more than 18 months after the
first time the applicant failed the examination.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f), the board may allow an applicant to take, for a fourth or
subsequent time, the advanced generalist or equivalent examination administered by the Association
of Social Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board if the applicant:
   (1) meets all requirements specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) other than passing the advanced
generalist or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board;
    (2) provides to the board a description of the efforts the applicant has made to improve the
applicant's score and demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that the efforts are likely to improve
the score; and
    (3) provides to the board letters of recommendation from two licensed social workers attesting
to the applicant's ability to practice social work competently and ethically in accordance with
professional social work knowledge, skills, and values.
    (h) An individual must not practice social work until the individual passes the examination and
receives a social work license under this section or section 148D.060. If the board has reason to
believe that an applicant may be practicing social work without a license, except as provided in

section 148D.065, and the applicant has failed the advanced generalist or equivalent examination
administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a similar examination body designated
by the board, the board may notify the applicant's employer that the applicant is not licensed as a
social worker.

                                   , To be licensed as a licensed independent clinical social worker, an
applicant for licensure by examination must provide evidence satisfactory to the board that the
applicant:
   (1) has received a graduate degree in social work from a program accredited by the Council
on Social Work Education, the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work, or a similar
accreditation body designated by the board;
   (2) has practiced clinical social work as defined in section 148D.010, including both diagnosis
and treatment, and has met the supervised practice requirements specified in sections 148D.100 to
148D.125;
    (3) has passed the clinical or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board. Unless an applicant applies
for licensure by endorsement pursuant to subdivision 7, an examination is not valid if it was taken
and passed eight or more years prior to submitting a completed, signed application form provided
by the board;
    (4) has submitted a completed, signed application form provided by the board, including the
applicable application fee specified in section 148D.180. For applications submitted electronically,
a "signed application" means providing an attestation as specified by the board;
   (5) has submitted the criminal background check fee and a form provided by the board
authorizing a criminal background check pursuant to subdivision 8;
     (6) has paid the license fee specified in section 148D.180; and
   (7) has not engaged in conduct that was or would be in violation of the standards of practice
specified in sections 148D.195 to 148D.240. If the applicant has engaged in conduct that was or
would be in violation of the standards of practice, the board may take action pursuant to sections
148D.255 to 148D.270.
72ND DAY]                                             FRIDAY, MAY 18, 2007                                                                  5557

    (b) An application which is not completed and signed, or which is not accompanied by the correct
fee, must be returned to the applicant, along with any fee submitted, and is void.
   (c) By submitting an application for licensure, an applicant authorizes the board to investigate
any information provided or requested in the application. The board may request that the applicant
provide additional information, verification, or documentation.
    (d) Within one year of the time the board receives an application for licensure, the applicant
must meet all the requirements specified in paragraph (a) and must provide all of the information
requested by the board pursuant to paragraph (c). If within one year the applicant does not meet all
the requirements, or does not provide all of the information requested, the applicant is considered
ineligible and the application for licensure must be closed.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraph (f), an applicant may not take more than three times the
clinical or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board. An applicant must receive a passing score on
the clinical or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board no later than 18 months after the first time the
applicant failed the examination.
   (f) Notwithstanding paragraph (e), the board may allow an applicant to take, for a fourth or
subsequent time, the clinical or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social
Work Boards or a similar examination body designated by the board if the applicant:
    (1) meets all requirements specified in paragraphs (a) to (d) other than passing the clinical
or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a similar
examination body designated by the board;
    (2) provides to the board a description of the efforts the applicant has made to improve the
applicant's score and demonstrates to the board's satisfaction that the efforts are likely to improve
the score; and
    (3) provides to the board letters of recommendation from two licensed social workers attesting
to the applicant's ability to practice social work competently and ethically in accordance with
professional social work knowledge, skills, and values.
    (g) An individual must not practice social work until the individual passes the examination and
receives a social work license under this section or section 148D.060. If the board has reason to
believe that an applicant may be practicing social work without a license, and the applicant has failed
the clinical or equivalent examination administered by the Association of Social Work Boards or a
similar examination body designated by the board, the board may notify the applicant's employer
that the applicant is not licensed as a social worker.

services from the former client or otherwise engaging in a business relationship with the former
client would be detrimental to the former client.

of witnesses and the production of all necessary papers, books, records, documents, and other
evidentiary material as part of its investigation of an applicant or licensee under this section or
chapter 214.
    (b) If any person fails or refuses to appear or testify regarding any matter about which the person
may be lawfully questioned, or fails or refuses to produce any papers, books, records, documents,
or other evidentiary materials in the matter to be heard, after having been required by order of the
board or by a subpoena of the board to do so, the board may institute a proceeding in any district
court to enforce the board's order or subpoena.
    (c) The board or a designated member of the board acting on behalf of the board may issue
subpoenas or administer oaths to witnesses or take affirmations. Depositions may be taken within
or out of the state in the manner provided by law for the taking of depositions in civil actions.
    (d) A subpoena or other process or paper may be served upon any person named therein, by mail
or by any officer authorized to serve subpoenas or other process or paper in civil actions, with the
same fees and mileage and in the same manner as prescribed by law for service of process issued

    Subd. 3. Mental or physical examination; chemical dependency evaluation. (a) If the board
(1) has probable cause to believe that an applicant or licensee has violated a statute or rule enforced

condition relevant to the violation, the board may issue an order directing the applicant or licensee to
submit to one or more of the following: a mental examination, a physical examination, or a chemical
dependency evaluation.
   (b) An examination or evaluation order issued by the board must include:
   (1) factual specifications on which the order is based;

to an examination or evaluation ordered by the board according to subdivision 3, unless the failure
was due to circumstances beyond the control of the applicant or licensee, the failure is an admission
that the applicant or licensee violated a statute or rule enforced by the board as specified in the
examination or evaluation order issued by the board. The failure may result in an application being
denied or other adversarial, corrective, or disciplinary action being taken by the board without a
contested case hearing.
    (b) If an applicant or licensee requests a contested case hearing after the board denies an
application or takes other disciplinary or adversarial action, the only issues which may be
determined at the hearing are:
   (1) whether the board had probable cause to issue the examination or evaluation order; and
   (2) whether the failure to submit to the examination or evaluation was due to circumstances
beyond the control of the applicant or licensee.
    (c) Neither the record of a proceeding under this subdivision nor an order issued by the board
may be admissible, subject to subpoena, or be used against the applicant or licensee in a proceeding
in which the board is not a party or decision maker.

examination or chemical dependency evaluation, and notwithstanding section 13.384, 144.651,
595.02, or any other statute limiting access to health records, the board or a designated member of
the board acting on behalf of the board may subpoena physical, mental, and chemical dependency
health records relating to an applicant or licensee without the applicant's or licensee's consent if:
   (1) the board has probable cause to believe that the applicant or licensee has violated chapter
214, a statute or rule enforced by the board, or an order issued by the board; and
   (2) the board has reason to believe that the records are relevant and necessary to the investigation.
    (b) An applicant, licensee, insurance company, government agency, health care facility, or
provider as defined in section 144.335, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), must comply with any
subpoena of the board under this subdivision and is not liable in any action for damages for
releasing information subpoenaed by the board under this subdivision unless the information
provided is false and the person or entity providing the information knew or had reason to know
that the information was false.
    (c) Information on individuals obtained under this subdivision must be treated as investigative
data under section 13.41 and be classified as confidential data.

client, the board or administrative law judge must not consider evidence of the client's or former
client's previous sexual conduct. Reference to the client's or former client's previous sexual conduct
must not be made during the proceedings or in the findings, except by motion of the complainant,
unless the evidence would be admissible under the applicable provisions of section 609.347,
subdivision 3.
    Subd. 7. Investigations involving vulnerable adults or children in need of protection.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), if the board receives a complaint about a social worker
regarding the social worker's involvement in a case of vulnerable adults or children in need of
protection, the county or other appropriate public authority may request that the board suspend its
investigation, and the board must comply until such time as the court issues its findings on the case.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the board may continue with an investigation if the board
determines that doing so is in the best interests of the vulnerable adult or a child in need of protection

an investigation, the board must notify the county or other appropriate public authority in writing
and state its reasons for doing so.

   (c) The board must periodically notify the licensee of the status of the complaint.
    Subd. 10. Resolution of complaints. In no more than one year after receiving a complaint

bring an action in district court for injunctive relief to restrain any unauthorized practice or violation
or threatened violation of any statute or rule, stipulation, or agreement agreed to or enforced by the
board or an order issued by the board.

data under chapter 13.
   (e) The board may impose a fee to reimburse the board for all or part of the costs of the
proceedings resulting in a corrective action, including, but not limited to, the amount paid by the

member may enter into a stipulation to cease practicing social work with a licensee if the board or
designated board member determines that the licensee is unable to practice social work competently

petition the board for termination of the stipulation.
   (c) A stipulation to cease practicing social work is not disciplinary action but must be treated as
public data under chapter 13.
