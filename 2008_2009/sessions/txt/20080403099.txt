   The motion prevailed. So the amendment was adopted.
   Senator Berglin moved to amend S.F. No. 3813 as follows:
   Page 255, after line 4, insert:
    "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 144E.45, subdivision 2, is amended
to read:
    Subd. 2. Potential allocations. (a) On November 1, annually, the board or the board's designee
under section 144E.40, subdivision 2, shall determine the amount of the allocation of the prior year's
accumulation to each qualified ambulance service person. The prior year's net investment gain or
loss under paragraph (b) must be allocated and that year's general fund appropriation, plus any
transfer from the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance account under section 144E.42, subdivision 2,
and after deduction of administrative expenses, also must be allocated.
    (b) The difference in the market value of the assets of the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance trust
account as of the immediately previous June 30 and the June 30 occurring 12 months earlier must
be reported on or before August 15 by the State Board of Investment. The market value gain or loss
must be expressed as a percentage of the total potential award accumulations as of the immediately
previous June 30, and that positive or negative percentage must be applied to increase or decrease
the recorded potential award accumulation of each qualified ambulance service person.
    (c) The appropriation for this purpose, after deduction of administrative expenses, must be
divided by the total number of additional ambulance service personnel years of service recognized
since the last allocation or 1,000 years of service, whichever is greater. If the allocation is based on
the 1,000 years of service, any allocation not made for a qualified ambulance service person must
be credited to the Cooper/Sams volunteer ambulance account under section 144E.42, subdivision
2. A qualified ambulance service person must be credited with a year of service if the person is
certified by the chief administrative officer of the ambulance service as having rendered active
ambulance service during the 12 months ending as of the immediately previous June 30. If the
person has rendered prior active ambulance service, the person must be additionally credited with
one-fifth of a year of service for each year of active ambulance service rendered before June 30,
1993, but not to exceed in any year one additional year of service or to exceed in total five years of
prior service. Prior active ambulance service means employment by or the provision of service to a
licensed ambulance service before June 30, 1993, as determined by the person's current ambulance
service based on records provided by the person that were contemporaneous to the service. The
prior ambulance service must be reported on or before August 1 to the board in an affidavit from
the chief administrative officer of the ambulance service.
   (d) Effective July 1, 2008, notwithstanding paragraphs (a) to (c), the value of each service credit
shall be $447.19."

The board shall make the first annual payment by June 30, 2009, and make annual payments by
June 30 each year thereafter until the area receives a bovine tuberculosis-free status and the owner

    Subd. 3. Cattle herds remaining in the zone. The board shall conduct a risk assessment for
cattle that continue to be located within the bovine tuberculosis management zone after December
31, 2008. If the board determines that cattle herds that continue to be located within the bovine
tuberculosis management zone present a risk of cattle and deer interaction, the board shall require
the owner of the cattle to keep all cattle in a manner that does not allow cattle and deer interface.
The board may also require that any stored forage crops located within the bovine tuberculosis
management zone are kept in a manner that does not allow deer access. The board shall offer
cost-share assistance for fencing under subdivision 4 to a person who is required to:
   (1) keep cattle in a manner that does not allow cattle and deer interface; or
   (2) keep stored forage crops in a manner that does not allow deer access.
    Subd. 4. Cost-share assistance for fencing. (a) The board shall provide cost-share assistance
to persons for fencing cattle and stored forage crops in areas where the board determines that there
is an unacceptable risk of transmitting bovine tuberculosis to deer. The cost-share payments shall
be 90 percent of the cost of an approved fence up to $75,000. The payments under this subdivision
shall be on a reimbursement basis and paid by the board after the board determines that the fence is
built to the specifications required by the board.
    (b) The board shall establish specifications for fences that qualify for cost-share assistance under
this subdivision and provide cattle owners with a list of approved fencing contractors. The fencing
must be constructed and maintained by an approved fencing contractor, the landowner, or the tenant.
    (c) The board shall periodically inspect fences for which cost-share assistance has been received
under this subdivision. If the board determines that a fence for which cost-share assistance has been
received is not being maintained or used properly, the board may:
   (1) order that the fence be repaired or used properly; or
    (2) place the herd under quarantine and require repayment to the board of any cost-share
assistance received by the person.
