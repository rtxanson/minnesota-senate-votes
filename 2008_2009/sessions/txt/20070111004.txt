   Subd. 19b. Subtractions from federal taxable income. For individuals, estates, and trusts, there
shall be subtracted from federal taxable income:
   (1) net interest income on obligations of any authority, commission, or instrumentality of the
United States to the extent includable in taxable income for federal income tax purposes but exempt
from state income tax under the laws of the United States;
    (2) if included in federal taxable income, the amount of any overpayment of income tax to
Minnesota or to any other state, for any previous taxable year, whether the amount is received as a
refund or as a credit to another taxable year's income tax liability;
    (3) the amount paid to others, less the amount used to claim the credit allowed under section
290.0674, not to exceed $1,625 for each qualifying child in grades kindergarten to 6 and $2,500 for

includes fees or tuition as defined in section 290.0674, subdivision 1, clause (1). As used in this
clause, "textbooks" includes books and other instructional materials and equipment purchased or

qualifying for deduction includes expenses as defined and limited in section 290.0674, subdivision
1, clause (3). "Textbooks" does not include instructional books and materials used in the teaching

worship, nor does it include books or materials for, or transportation to, extracurricular activities
including sporting events, musical or dramatic events, speech activities, driver's education, or
similar programs. For purposes of the subtraction provided by this clause, "qualifying child" has
the meaning given in section 32(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;
     (4) income as provided under section 290.0802;
   (5) to the extent included in federal adjusted gross income, income realized on disposition of
property exempt from tax under section 290.491;
    (6) to the extent not deducted or not deductible pursuant to section 408(d)(8)(E) of the Internal
Revenue Code in determining federal taxable income by an individual who does not itemize
deductions for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, an amount equal to 50 percent

for a credit under section 290.06, subdivision 22, an amount equal to the carryover of subnational
foreign taxes for the taxable year, but not to exceed the total subnational foreign taxes reported
in claiming the foreign tax credit. For purposes of this clause, "federal foreign tax credit" means
the credit allowed under section 27 of the Internal Revenue Code, and "carryover of subnational
foreign taxes" equals the carryover allowed under section 904(c) of the Internal Revenue Code
minus national level foreign taxes to the extent they exceed the federal foreign tax credit;

required under subdivision 19a, clause (7), or 19c, clause (15), in the case of a shareholder of
a corporation that is an S corporation, an amount equal to one-fifth of the delayed depreciation.
For purposes of this clause, "delayed depreciation" means the amount of the addition made by
the taxpayer under subdivision 19a, clause (7), or subdivision 19c, clause (15), in the case of a
shareholder of an S corporation, minus the positive value of any net operating loss under section
172 of the Internal Revenue Code generated for the tax year of the addition. The resulting delayed
depreciation cannot be less than zero;
