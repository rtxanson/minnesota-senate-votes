    (b) To reduce the risk that state general funds will be needed to pay debt service on the
state guaranteed bonds, the commissioner must require that the financing arrangements include
a coverage test satisfactory to the commissioner so that the sum of the value of the assets and
other security pledged to the payment of bonds or the rent due under any lease of the project and
taken into account by the commissioner is no less than 125 percent of the difference between the
outstanding state guaranteed bonds, and any cash collateral held in a debt service reserve account
and pledged to the payment of principal and interest for the state guaranteed bonds and no other
bonds. Assets and other security that may be taken into account include (1) net unencumbered
value of the project and any collateral or third party guaranty, including a letter of credit, pledged
or otherwise furnished by a user of the project or by a benefited airline company as security for the
payment of rent, (2) bond proceeds, including earnings thereon, and (3) prepayments of rent, after
making such adjustments the commissioner determines to be appropriate to take into account any
outstanding bonds secured by a lien on the project or rent that is prior to the lien securing the state
guaranteed bonds, but excluding any cash collateral deducted from the outstanding state guaranteed

With the approval of the commissioner, the owner of the facility may place a mortgage or security
interest lien on the facility or any interest in or part of the facility. The mortgage is exempt from
the mortgage registry tax imposed under chapter 287. In the event of a default under the loan, lease
agreement, or other revenue agreement, the facility, or any part of the facility, may be leased or sold
to another person for any lawful purpose, subject to the approval of the commissioner. The approval
of the commissioner is not required if the bond trustee has taken control of the facility as a result of
a default.
    The ownership of the facility by the owner may create no liability of the owner for payment of
the debt service on the bonds if so determined by the commissioner. The owner may require as a
condition of entering into the lease of the facility that the lessee or other party pay all costs, expenses,
or any other obligations of ownership of the facility.
    No revenues derived from the lease of the project may be used other than for a purpose related
to the project, including its operation, administration, maintenance, improvement, or financing.

association under section 272.68, subdivision 4.
    (c) Taxes imposed by this subdivision are payable as in the case of personal property taxes
and shall be assessed to the lessees or users of real or personal property in the same manner as
taxes assessed to owners of real or personal property, except that such taxes shall not become a
lien against the property. When due, the taxes shall constitute a debt due from the lessee or user to
the state, township, city, county, and school district for which the taxes were assessed and shall be
collected in the same manner as personal property taxes. If property subject to the tax imposed by
this subdivision is leased or used jointly by two or more persons, each lessee or user shall be jointly
and severally liable for payment of the tax.
    (d) The tax on real property of the state or any of its political subdivisions that is leased by a
private individual, association, or corporation and becomes taxable under this subdivision or other
provision of law must be assessed and collected as a personal property assessment. The taxes do not
become a lien against the real property.

    (b) For the first taxable year when the facility has been in operation for at least three consecutive
months, the credit is equal to $5,000 multiplied by the number of persons employed by the
corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the last day of the taxable year, not to exceed
the number of persons employed by the corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the date
90 days before the last day of the taxable year. For each of the succeeding four taxable years, the
credit is equal to $5,000 multiplied by the number of persons employed by the corporation on
a full-time basis at the facility on the last day of the taxable year, not to exceed the number of
persons employed by the corporation on a full-time basis at the facility on the date 90 days before
the last day of the taxable year.
    (c) For the first taxable year in which the credit is allowed for the facility, the credit must not
exceed 80 percent of the wages paid to or incurred for persons employed by the taxpayer at the
facility during the taxable year. For the succeeding four taxable years, the credit must not exceed 20
percent of the wages paid to or incurred for persons employed by the taxpayer at the facility during
the taxable year. For purposes of this section, "wages" has the meaning given under section 3121(b)
of the Internal Revenue Code, except the limitation to the contribution and benefit base does not
apply.
    (d) If the credit provided under this subdivision exceeds the tax liability of the corporation for
the taxable year, the excess amount of the credit may be carried over to each of the 20 taxable years
succeeding the taxable year. The entire amount of the credit must be carried to the earliest taxable

following taxable year. No credit may be carried to a taxable year more than 20 years after the
taxable year in which the credit was earned.
    (e) If an unused portion of the credit remains at the end of the carryover period under paragraph
(d), the commissioner shall refund the unused portion to the taxpayer. The provisions of this
paragraph do not apply if the corporation that earned the credit under this subdivision or a successor
in interest to the corporation filed for bankruptcy protection.

has been committed to the MacPhail Center
for Music from nonstate sources, and that
the available money is sufficient to complete
a functional facility. Money secured before
the effective date of this section may count
toward the required commitment of nonstate
sources, provided it is used for qualified
capital expenditures. Any land acquisition
costs paid by MacPhail Center for Music
qualify as capital expenditures.
(b) The city of Minneapolis may provide
money to predesign, design, construct,
furnish, and equip a center for music
education, including classrooms and a
recital hall in the city of Minneapolis,
to provide a facility for education of
students, music therapy programs for
persons with disabilities, music teacher
training opportunities, curriculum and
program development, and to provide the
programming in public and private schools
and in partnership with other organizations
throughout the state.
(c) The required demonstration of a
commitment of funds from nonstate sources
has been met by cash, prepaid qualified
expenses, and private multiyear pledges that
have been converted into cash through bond
financing and a letter of credit secured by
a mortgage lien on the state bond financed
property. The $5,000,000 construction grant
shall be disbursed without requirement that
the mortgage lien be released.
