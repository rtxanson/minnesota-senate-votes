educational needs and foster parents' meaningful participation in their children's education, a school
district may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirement to maintain racial balance
within a district school if the racial imbalance in that school results from:

students reflects the proportion of multiracial students who reside in the school attendance area or
who are enrolled in the grade levels served by the district; or

an intensive English component.

enrolling in another school with the requisite racial balance, and the students' parents choose not to
pursue that option.

expertise in languages indigenous to this state. The ten Indian community members shall be selected

the council are not subject to the open appointments process under section 15.0597.
    (b) The council shall annually elect a chair and executive secretary and other officers it deems
necessary. The chair may appoint subcommittees necessary to fulfill the duties of the council.
Because the council performs functions that are not purely advisory, the council is not subject to

educational programs that provide language revitalization to meet the needs of the community. In
order to develop these guidelines, the council shall collaborate with American Indian community
groups to develop the resources needed to provide native language classes.
    (b) The council shall promote activities and programs that are specific to promoting
revitalization of indigenous language for American Indian children and adults. Since language
revitalization is critical for the youngest of American Indian children, the council shall focus on
developing programs that meet the language needs of children in prekindergarten through grade 12.
In addition, the Council on Indigenous Language shall work with community groups, educational
groups and institutions, and tribes to identify programs that will promote the preservation and
revitalization of indigenous language in order for children to learn the speaking, reading, and
writing of native language.
   (c) The council shall administer grants to organizations, programs, and schools that meet the
guidelines developed by the council for programs that provide language revitalization to children

Education and other federal agencies to meet the special needs of students for native language
learning.
   (f) The council shall work with existing government and tribal agencies to integrate funding and
remove barriers to enable statewide language revitalization efforts to be successful.
    (g) The council shall work in collaboration with the Department of Education, the Office of
Higher Education, and the Department of Human Services to develop a multitiered system for native
speakers to be certified on special status by the Board of Teaching to enable native speakers to teach
in all language revitalization programs and schools.
    (h) The council shall work to develop an Indigenous Language Institute to develop standards on
curriculum, critical pedagogy, and scope and sequence as it pertains to indigenous language learning.

equipment. Contracts, including grant contracts, must be approved by the board and executed by
the executive director of the council. The council may apply for, receive, and expend in its own
name grants and gifts of money consistent with the duties specified in this section.
    (j) The council shall report to the legislature by January 15 of each year regarding the use of
indigenous languages within the state and the status of programs and efforts to preserve and promote
them.

of the council. A majority of the voting members of the council is a quorum.
    Subd. 4. Appropriations and money received for the Council on Indigenous Language.
All money and appropriations received for the Council on Indigenous Language must be used to
further the purpose of language revitalization. Money and appropriations received for language
revitalization shall not be transferred or reallocated for any other purpose.
   Sec. 2. INITIAL MEETING.
   The initial meeting of the Council on Indigenous Language shall be convened by a facilitator

cross-categorical program that has the following components:
    (1) a system of valid and reliable general outcomes measures in reading and, to the extent
possible, in mathematics with satisfactory correlations to state testing administered to all students
in kindergarten through eighth grade at least three times per year. The assessment must be called
a benchmark assessment. Pupils in grades nine and above may participate in such assessments as
determined by the school. The system must have the capability to provide benchmark assessments
by measuring the performance of all pupils three times per year and the capability to implement
Progress Monitoring. For the purpose of this section, Progress Monitoring is the frequent and
continuous measurement of pupil performance;
   (2) a system of scientifically based instruction and intervention in reading, mathematics, and
behavioral interventions; and
    (3) an organizational plan that allows teachers, paraprofessionals, and volunteers funded through
various funding streams to work as a team by grade level or other configuration across all grades
and settings to deliver instruction using a tiered model. The team must be trained in response to
intervention methodology.
     (c) A site using the provisions of paragraph (b) must have its teachers and paraprofessionals

work together in a collaborative manner with students who are at risk of not meeting standards.
Staff being claimed for state special education categorical aid may, as an intervention provided for
in paragraph (b) (2), provide instruction to pupils who are at risk of not meeting standards when
instructing them in a small group, which includes one or more students with a disability at the same
instructional level and making the same progress in the curriculum or intervention so long as the
needs of the pupils with disabilities are being met consistent with their individual education plans.
Schools must ensure that the needs of the student with a disability in such groupings remain the
focus of instruction. Schools must not establish permanent classes or groups for instruction as part
of meeting this requirement. To the extent allowed by federal law teachers and paraprofessionals
shall not be considered to be supplanting funds when instructing a group of students during the
core reading or mathematics time established by the school since such instruction supplements the
capacity of the regular classroom teacher to provide instruction.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 126C.10, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
  Subd. 2c. Early intervention to make adequate yearly progress revenue. Early intervention
AYP revenue for each district adopting the provisions of section 125A.56, paragraph (b), equals:
    (1) $....... per adjusted marginal cost pupil units for the school year. This revenue may be used
to implement the requirements of section 125A.56 and may be used for the costs of assessments
systems, including Benchmark and Progress Monitoring systems, Pupil Behavioral Data Collection
systems and measures of academic performance but not the cost of state assessments;
    (2) $....... per adjusted marginal cost pupil units for the school year. This revenue may be used for
the cost of electronic instructional systems or instructional personnel delivering instruction outside
the core curriculum; and
    (3) $....... per adjusted marginal cost pupil units for the school year. This revenue may be used
to hire literacy and mathematics coaches, training for staff in problem solving, and intervention
methodology. Staff must be trained in the provisions of section 125A.56.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Department of Education. The sums indicated in this section are appropriated
from the general fund to the Department of Education for the fiscal years designated.

Psychology Department to develop and update frequent and continuous measurements of
mathematics performance and to determine correlation of these measures to the state assessments.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for revenue for fiscal year 2008 and later."
  And when so amended the bill do pass and be re-referred to the Committee on Finance.
