    Reports the same back with the recommendation that the bill be amended as follows:
    Delete everything after the enacting clause and insert:
   "Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
   Subd. 4a. Best value; construction. For purposes of construction, building, alteration,
improvement, or repair services, "best value" describes the result determined by a procurement
method that considers price and performance criteria, which may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) the quality of the vendor's or contractor's performance on previous projects;
    (2) the timeliness of the vendor's or contractor's performance on previous projects;
   (3) the level of customer satisfaction with the vendor's or contractor's performance on previous
projects;
   (4) the vendor's or contractor's record of performing previous projects on budget and ability to
minimize cost overruns;
    (5) the vendor's or contractor's ability to minimize change orders;
    (6) the vendor's or contractor's ability to prepare appropriate project plans;
    (7) the vendor's or contractor's technical capacities;
    (8) the individual qualifications of the contractor's key personnel; or
    (9) the vendor's or contractor's ability to assess and minimize risks.
    "Performance on previous projects" does not include the exercise or assertion of a person's legal
rights. This definition does not apply to sections 16C.32, 16C.33, 16C.34, and 16C.35.
    Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 20. Vendor. "Vendor" means a business, including a construction contractor or a natural
person, and includes both if the natural person is engaged in a business.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.03, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Acquisition authority. The commissioner shall acquire all goods, services, and utilities
needed by agencies. The commissioner shall acquire goods, services, and utilities by requests for
bids, requests for proposals, reverse auctions as provided in section 16C.10, subdivision 7, or other
methods provided by law, unless a section of law requires a particular method of acquisition to be
used. The commissioner shall make all decisions regarding acquisition activities. The determination
of the acquisition method and all decisions involved in the acquisition process, unless otherwise
provided for by law, shall be based on best value which includes an evaluation of price and may
include other considerations including, but not limited to, environmental considerations, quality, and
vendor performance. A best value determination must be based on the evaluation criteria detailed
in the solicitation document. If criteria other than price are used, the solicitation document must
state the relative importance of price and other factors. U        ­n

Any or all responses may be rejected. When using the request for bid process, the bid must be
awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, taking into consideration conformity with
the specifications, terms of delivery, the purpose for which the contract or purchase is intended, the
status and capability of the vendor, and other considerations imposed in the request for bids. The
commissioner may decide which is the lowest responsible bidder for all purchases and may use the
principles of life-cycle costing, where appropriate, in determining the lowest overall bid. The duties
set forth in this subdivision are subject to delegation pursuant to this section.
    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Acquisition authority; construction contracts. For all building and construction
contracts, the commissioner shall award contracts pursuant to section 16C.28, and "best value" shall
be defined and applied as set forth in sections 16C.02, subdivision 4a, and 16C.28, subdivision 1,
paragraph (a), clause (2). The duties set forth in this subdivision are subject to delegation pursuant to
this section. The commissioner shall establish procedures for developing and awarding best value
requests for proposals for construction projects. The criteria to be used to evaluate the proposals
must be included in the solicitation document and must be evaluated in an open and competitive
manner.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.03, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 19. Training. Users of best value procurement may be trained in the request for proposals
process for best value contracting for construction projects. The commissioner may establish a
training program for state and local officials and employees, and vendors and contractors, on
best value procurement for construction projects, including those governed by section 16C.02,
subdivision 4a. If the commissioner establishes such a training program, the state may charge a
fee for providing training.
    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.26, is amended to read:
    16C.26 COMPETITIVE BIDS OR PROPOSALS.
    Subdivision 1. Application. Except as otherwise provided by sections 16C.10, 16C.26 and
16C.27, all contracts for building and construction or repairs must be based on competitive bids or
proposals. "Competitive proposals" specifically refers to the method of procurement described in
section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
    Subd. 2. Requirement contracts. Standard requirement price contracts for building and
construction must be established by competitive bids as provided in subdivision 1. The standard
requirement price contracts may contain escalation clauses and may provide for a negotiated price
increase or decrease based upon a demonstrable industrywide or regional increase or decrease in
the vendor's costs or for the addition of similar products or replacement items not significant to the
total value of existing contracts. The term of these contracts may not exceed five years including
all extensions.
    Subd. 3. Publication of notice; expenditures over $25,000. If the amount of an expenditure
is estimated to exceed $25,000, bids or proposals must be solicited by public notice in a manner
designated by the commissioner. To the extent practical, this must include posting on a state Web
site. For expenditures over $50,000, when a call for bids is issued, the commissioner shall solicit

sealed bids by providing notices to all prospective bidders known to the commissioner by posting
notice on a state Web site at least seven days before the final date of submitting bids. All bids over
$50,000 must be sealed when they are received and must be opened in public at the hour stated in the
notice. All proposals responsive to a request for proposals according to section 16C.28, subdivision
1, paragraph (a), clause (2), shall be submitted and evaluated in the manner described in the request
for proposals, regardless of the dollar amount. All original bids and proposals and all documents
pertaining to the award of a contract must be retained and made a part of a permanent file or record
and remain open to public inspection.
    Subd. 4. Building and construction contracts; $50,000 or less. An informal bid may be used
for building, construction, and repair contracts that are estimated at less than $50,000. Informal
bids must be authenticated by the bidder in a manner specified by the commissioner. Alternatively,
a request for proposals may be issued according to section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),
clause (2), for such contracts.
    Subd. 5. Standard specifications, security. Contracts must be based on the standard
specifications prescribed and enforced by the commissioner under this chapter, unless otherwise
expressly provided or as authorized under section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).

businesses designated under section 16C.16 when entering into contracts that are not subject to
competitive bidding procedures.
       Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 16C.27, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
   Subdivision 1. Single source of supply. Competitive bidding ­s   i­ or proposals are not required for
contracts clearly and legitimately limited to a single source of supply, and the contract price may be
best established by direct negotiation.

principles of life-cycle costing; or
    (2) the vendor or contractor offering the best value, taking into account the specifications of the
request for proposals, the price and performance criteria as set forth in section 16C.02, subdivision
4a, and described in the solicitation document.
    (b) The vendor or contractor must secure bonding, commercial general insurance coverage, and
workers' compensation insurance coverage under paragraph (a), clause (1) or (2). The commissioner
shall determine whether to use the procurement process described in paragraph (a), clause (1), or the
procurement process described in paragraph (a), clause (2). If the commissioner uses the method in
paragraph (a), clause (2), the head of the agency shall determine which vendor or contractor offers
the best value, subject to the approval of the commissioner. Any or all bids or proposals may be
rejected.
    Subd. 1a. Establishment and purpose. (a) The state recognizes the importance of the inclusion
of a best value contracting system for construction as an alternative to the current low-bid system
of procurement. In order to accomplish that goal, state and local governmental entities shall be able
to choose the best value system in different phases.
   (b) "Best value" means the procurement method defined in section 16C.02, subdivision 4a.
   (c) The following entities are eligible to participate in phase I:

   (2) all other townships, school districts, and political subdivisions in the state.
Phase III begins three years from the effective date of this section.
    (f) The commissioner or any agency for which competitive bids or proposals are required may
not use best value contracting as defined in section 16C.02, subdivision 4a, for more than one project
annually, or 20 percent of its projects, whichever is greater, in each of the first three fiscal years in
which best value construction contracting is used.

    Subd. 2. Alterations and erasures. A bid containing an alteration or erasure of any price
contained in the bid which is used in determining the lowest responsible bid must be rejected unless
the alteration or erasure is corrected in a manner that is clear and authenticated by an authorized
representative of the responder. An alteration or erasure may be crossed out and the correction
printed in ink or typewritten adjacent to it and initialed by an authorized representative of the
responder.

vendor or contractor who has failed to perform a previous contract with the state. In the case of
identical low bids from two or more bidders, the commissioner may use negotiated procurement
methods with the tied low bidders for that particular transaction so long as the price paid does not
exceed the low tied bid price. The commissioner may award contracts to more than one ­        b­d

vendor or contractor in accordance with subdivision 1, if doing so does not decrease the service
level or diminish the effect of competition.
    Subd. 4. Record. A record must be kept of all bids or proposals, including names of bidders,
amounts of bids or proposals, and each successful bid or proposal. This record is open to public
inspection, subject to section 13.591 and other applicable law.
   Subd. 5. Preferences not cumulative. The preferences under sections 16B.121, 16C.06,
subdivision 7, and 16C.16 apply, but are not cumulative. The total percentage of preference granted
on a contract may not exceed the highest percentage of preference allowed for that contract under
any one of those sections.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103D.811, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
   Subd. 3. Awarding of contract. (a) At a time and place specified in the bid notice, the managers

by satisfactory completion of the contract.
    (b) Bids must not be considered which in the aggregate exceed by more than 30 percent the total
estimated cost of construction or implementation.

value as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
   (d) The contract must be in writing and be accompanied by or refer to the plans and
specifications for the work to be done as prepared by the engineer for the watershed district. The
plans and specifications shall become a part of the contract.

   ­­­) (e) The contract shall be approved by the managers and signed by the president, secretary,
and contractor.
   Sec. 10. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 103E.505, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

   Sec. 11. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 116A.13, subdivision 5, is amended to read:

and material, and ­

the contract may be awarded to the vendor or contractor offering the best value under a request for
proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
   Sec. 12. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.52, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Contracts. A contract for work or labor, or for the purchase of furniture, fixtures,
or other property, except books registered under the copyright laws, or for the construction or repair
of school houses, the estimated cost or value of which shall exceed that specified in section 471.345,
subdivision 3, must not be made by the school board without first advertising for bids or proposals
by two weeks' published notice in the official newspaper. This notice must state the time and place
of receiving bids and contain a brief description of the subject matter.
   Additional publication in the official newspaper or elsewhere may be made as the board shall
deem necessary.
    After taking into consideration conformity with the specifications, terms of delivery, and other
conditions imposed in the call for bids, every such contract for which a call for bids has been issued
must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder, be duly executed in writing, and be otherwise
conditioned as required by law. The person to whom the contract is awarded shall give a sufficient
bond to the board for its faithful performance. Notwithstanding section 574.26 or any other law
to the contrary, on a contract limited to the purchase of a finished tangible product, a board may
require, at its discretion, a performance bond of a contractor in the amount the board considers
necessary. A record must be kept of all bids, with names of bidders and amount of bids, and with the
successful bid indicated thereon. A bid containing an alteration or erasure of any price contained in
the bid which is used in determining the lowest responsible bid must be rejected unless the alteration
or erasure is corrected as provided in this section. An alteration or erasure may be crossed out
and the correction thereof printed in ink or typewritten adjacent thereto and initialed in ink by the
person signing the bid. In the case of identical low bids from two or more bidders, the board may, at
its discretion, utilize negotiated procurement methods with the tied low bidders for that particular
transaction, so long as the price paid does not exceed the low tied bid price. In the case where only
a single bid is received, the board may, at its discretion, negotiate a mutually agreeable contract
with the bidder so long as the price paid does not exceed the original bid. If no satisfactory bid is
received, the board may readvertise. Standard requirement price contracts established for supplies
or services to be purchased by the district must be established by competitive bids. Such standard
requirement price contracts may contain escalation clauses and may provide for a negotiated price
increase or decrease based upon a demonstrable industrywide or regional increase or decrease in
the vendor's costs. Either party to the contract may request that the other party demonstrate such
increase or decrease. The term of such contracts must not exceed two years with an option on the
part of the district to renew for an additional two years. Contracts for the purchase of perishable
food items, except milk for school lunches and vocational training programs, in any amount may
be made by direct negotiation by obtaining two or more written quotations for the purchase or sale,
when possible, without advertising for bids or otherwise complying with the requirements of this
section or section 471.345, subdivision 3. All quotations obtained shall be kept on file for a period
of at least one year after receipt.

    Every contract made without compliance with the provisions of this section shall be void. Except
in the case of the destruction of buildings or injury thereto, where the public interest would suffer
by delay, contracts for repairs may be made without advertising for bids.
   Sec. 13. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 123B.52, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1b. Best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement method described in
subdivision 1, a contract for construction, building, alteration, improvement, or repair work may be
awarded to the vendor or contractor offering the best value under a request for proposals as described
in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
   Sec. 14. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 160.17, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement method referenced in
subdivision 2, counties or towns may issue a request for proposal and award the contract to the
vendor or contractor offering the best value as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph
(a), clause (2).
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 160.262, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 5. Best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement method described in
subdivision 4, the commissioner may allow for the award of design-build contracts for the projects
described in subdivision 4 to the vendor or contractor offering the best value under a request for
proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), clause (2).
   Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 161.32, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1f. Best value alternative. As an alternative to the procurement method described in
subdivisions 1a to 1e, the commissioner may issue a request for proposals and award the contract
to the vendor or contractor offering the best value as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1,

and conditions upon which the contract is to be let and name a time and place where the bids
will be received, opened, and read publicly, which time shall be not less than seven days after

obtainable, or the emergency repairs may be contracted for or performed without securing formal
competitive bids. An emergency, for purposes of this section, is unforeseen circumstances or
conditions which result in the jeopardizing of human life or property.
   In all contracts involving the employment of labor, the commissioners shall stipulate conditions
they deem reasonable, as to the hours of labor and wages and may stipulate as to the residence of
employees to be employed by the contractors.

to all the provisions of sections 574.26 to 574.31.

    (2) award contracts to the contractors that the construction manager determines provide the best
value under a request for proposals as described in section 16C.28, subdivision 1, paragraph (a),

soliciting competitive bids if the construction manager provides evidence of competitive pricing.
The authority shall require that the construction manager certify, before the contract is signed, a fixed
and stipulated construction price and completion date to the authority and post a performance bond
in an amount at least equal to 100 percent of the certified price, to cover any costs which may be
incurred in excess of the certified price, including but not limited to costs incurred by the authority or

setting or modifying child support or in determining whether to deviate upward or downward from
the presumptive child support obligation:
    (1) all earnings, income, circumstances, and resources of each parent, including real and personal
property, but excluding income from excess employment of the obligor or obligee that meets the
criteria of section 518A.29, paragraph (b);

percent of its market value, and no building permit has been applied for within 180 days of when
the property is damaged. In this case, a municipality may impose reasonable conditions upon a
building permit in order to mitigate any newly created impact on adjacent property.

The gap insurance polices must meet the criteria described in subdivision 4;
   (3) recommendations for funding arrangements necessary to finance the state catastrophic health
plan, including, but not limited to, a one percent employer payroll fee and a one percent employee

health benefits directly to their employees and creating tax deductions for individuals for health
plan premiums, medical expenses, and contributions to a health savings account;
   (4) providing a premium subsidy in the form of a voucher for low-income individuals and
families who are not eligible for medical assistance to enable these individuals and families to
purchase a gap insurance policy or contribute to a health savings account. The amount of the
subsidy must be based on income and family size;

care costs and quality indicators. The Web site must include information and links to enable
consumers to assess and compare cost, quality, and efficiency of Minnesota health care providers
and health plan options;
    (6) recommendations on the implementation of an electronic medical expense card that would
track an individual's medical expenses incurred during the calendar year in order to determine
eligibility to the state catastrophic health plan; and

coverage and services, rate of uninsurance, rate of uncompensated care provided, and quality of
care.
   (b) The proposed plan shall maintain the medical assistance program as a safety net for
low-income, disabled, and elderly persons.
   (c) In developing the statewide plan, the commissioner and task force may offer alternative
proposals to those specified in this section as long as the proposed alternatives follow the basic
parameters of the redesign proposal.
   Subd. 3. State catastrophic health plan. (a) The state catastrophic health plan shall provide
health care coverage to any individual who has spent within a calendar year the greater of:
   (1) 12 percent of the individual's or family's gross income based on the previous calendar year's
gross income; or
   (2) $30,000 for a family or $20,000 for an individual on medical expenses, including premiums
and cost sharing.

    (e) The plan may include cost-sharing requirements.
    Subd. 4. Gap insurance policies. The gap insurance policies shall be offered on an individual
guaranteed basis to provide health care coverage until eligibility for the state catastrophic health
plan is met. The gap insurance policies must provide coverage for all benefits offered under the state
catastrophic health plan. Premium rates may vary to reflect actuarially valid differences attributable
to age, nonuse of tobacco, and compliance with recommended health screenings and preventive
care. Premium rate variations must be in accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 62L.08. The
purchase of gap insurance shall be optional with a variety of plans offered with a range of annual
deductibles and including a health savings account option."

    "Sec. 52. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.48, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Prohibited practices. A nursing facility is not eligible to receive medical
assistance payments unless it refrains from all of the following:
   (a) Charging private paying residents rates for similar services which exceed those which are
approved by the state agency for medical assistance recipients as determined by the prospective
desk audit rate, except under the following circumstances:
    (1) the nursing facility may ­ (1

             ­­) (ii) charge for special services which are not included in the daily rate if medical
assistance residents are charged separately at the same rate for the same services in addition to the
daily rate paid by the commissioner.   ­;
    (2) effective July 1, 2007, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up to two
percent higher than the allowable payment rate in effect on June 30, 2007, plus an adjustment equal
to any other rate increase provided in law, for the RUGs group currently assigned to the resident;
    (3) effective July 1, 2008, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up to four
percent higher than the allowable payment rate in effect on June 30, 2007, plus an adjustment equal
to any other rate increase provided in law, for the RUGs group currently assigned to the resident;
   (4) effective July 1, 2009, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up to six
percent higher than the allowable payment rate in effect on June 30, 2007, plus an adjustment equal

to any other rate increase provided in law, for the RUGs group currently assigned to the resident;
and
    (5) effective July 1, 2010, nursing facilities may charge private paying residents rates up to eight
percent higher than the allowable payment rate in effect on June 30, 2007, plus an adjustment equal
to any other rate increase provided in law, for the RUGs group currently assigned to the resident.
    For purposes of this subdivision, the allowable payment rate under section 256B.434 includes
adjustments for enhanced rates during the first 30 days under section 256B.431, subdivision 32, and
private room differentials under clause (1), item (i), and Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart
11, item C. Nothing in this section precludes a nursing facility from charging a rate allowable
under the facility's single room election option under Minnesota Rules, part 9549.0060, subpart
11. Services covered by the payment rate must be the same regardless of payment source. Special
services, if offered, must be available to all residents in all areas of the nursing facility and charged
separately at the same rate. Residents are free to select or decline special services. Special services
must not include services which must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with
licensure or certification standards and that if not provided would result in a deficiency or violation
by the nursing facility. Services beyond those required to comply with licensure or certification
standards must not be charged separately as a special service if they were included in the payment
rate for the previous reporting year. A nursing facility that charges a private paying resident a rate in
violation of this clause is subject to an action by the state of Minnesota or any of its subdivisions or
agencies for civil damages. A private paying resident or the resident's legal representative has a cause
of action for civil damages against a nursing facility that charges the resident rates in violation of this
clause. The damages awarded shall include three times the payments that result from the violation,
together with costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys' fees or their equivalent. A
private paying resident or the resident's legal representative, the state, subdivision or agency, or a
nursing facility may request a hearing to determine the allowed rate or rates at issue in the cause
of action. Within 15 calendar days after receiving a request for such a hearing, the commissioner
shall request assignment of an administrative law judge under sections 14.48 to 14.56 to conduct the
hearing as soon as possible or according to agreement by the parties. The administrative law judge
shall issue a report within 15 calendar days following the close of the hearing. The prohibition set
forth in this clause shall not apply to facilities licensed as boarding care facilities which are not
certified as skilled or intermediate care facilities level I or II for reimbursement through medical
assistance.
    (b) Effective July 1, 2011, paragraph (a) no longer applies, except that special services, if offered,
must be available to all residents of the nursing facility and charged separately at the same rate.
Residents are free to select or decline special services. Special services must not include services
which must be provided by the nursing facility in order to comply with licensure or certification
standards and that, if not provided, would result in a deficiency or violation by the nursing facility.
    (c) (1) Charging, soliciting, accepting, or receiving from an applicant for admission to the
facility, or from anyone acting in behalf of the applicant, as a condition of admission, expediting
the admission, or as a requirement for the individual's continued stay, any fee, deposit, gift, money,
donation, or other consideration not otherwise required as payment under the state plan;         ­. For
residents on medical assistance, medical assistance payment according to the state plan must be
accepted as payment in full for continued stay, except where otherwise provided for under statute;
   (2) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to loan any money to

the nursing facility;
    (3) requiring an individual, or anyone acting in behalf of the individual, to promise to leave all
or part of the individual's estate to the facility; or
   (4) requiring a third-party guarantee of payment to the facility as a condition of admission,
expedited admission, or continued stay in the facility.
Nothing in this paragraph would prohibit discharge for nonpayment of services in accordance with
state and federal regulations.

      ) (d) Requiring any resident of the nursing facility to utilize a vendor of health care services
chosen by the nursing facility. A nursing facility may require a resident to use pharmacies that
utilize unit dose packing systems approved by the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy, and may require
a resident to use pharmacies that are able to meet the federal regulations for safe and timely
administration of medications such as systems with specific number of doses, prompt delivery of
medications, or access to medications on a 24-hour basis. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
paragraph, nursing facilities shall not restrict a resident's choice of pharmacy because the pharmacy
utilizes a specific system of unit dose drug packing.

assistance payments to a nursing facility or boarding care home which is in violation of this section
if extreme hardship to the residents would result. In these cases the commissioner shall issue an
order requiring the nursing facility to correct the violation. The nursing facility shall have 20 days
from its receipt of the order to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within the
20-day period the commissioner may reduce the payment rate to the nursing facility by up to 20
percent. The amount of the payment rate reduction shall be related to the severity of the violation
and shall remain in effect until the violation is corrected. The nursing facility or boarding care
home may appeal the commissioner's action pursuant to the provisions of chapter 14 pertaining to
contested cases. An appeal shall be considered timely if written notice of appeal is received by the
commissioner within 20 days of notice of the commissioner's proposed action.
    In the event that the commissioner determines that a nursing facility is not eligible for
reimbursement for a resident who is eligible for medical assistance, the commissioner may
authorize the nursing facility to receive reimbursement on a temporary basis until the resident can
be relocated to a participating nursing facility.
   Certified beds in facilities which do not allow medical assistance intake on July 1, 1984, or after
shall be deemed to be decertified for purposes of section 144A.071 only."

    "Sec. 24. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 259.29, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
   Subd. 2. Placement with relative o    r, friend, or married couple. The authorized child-placing
                                        ­­
agency shall consider placement, consistent with the child's best interests and in the following
order, with (1) a relative or relatives of the child, ­
                                                      o­r (2) an important friend with whom the child
has resided or had significant contact, or (3) a married couple. In implementing this section, an
authorized child-placing agency may disclose private or confidential data, as defined in section
13.02, to relatives of the child for the purpose of locating a suitable adoptive home. The agency
shall disclose only data that is necessary to facilitate implementing the preference.
    If the child's birth parent or parents explicitly request that placement with relatives or important
friends not be considered, the authorized child-placing agency shall honor that request consistent
with the best interests of the child.
   If the child's birth parent or parents express a preference for placing the child in an adoptive
home of the same or a similar religious background to that of the birth parent or parents, the agency
shall place the child with a family that meets the birth parent's religious preference.

   Sec. 2. [124D.332] PREKINDERGARTEN EDUCATION ACT.
    Subdivision 1. Allowance; establishment; purpose. A prekindergarten education allowance
finance system is established to provide choices for families of young children, close the
achievement gap in kindergarten through grade 12 public education; improve learning preparedness,
and promote healthy development and school readiness through quality early care and education
settings.
    Subd. 2. Eligibility; allowance amount. A parent or legal guardian of a child domiciled in this
state who will be at least age three and has not reached the age of five on August 31 is eligible
to receive a prekindergarten education allowance of $200 for each eligible child. In addition, the
prekindergarten education allowance for each eligible child must be increased according to the
following:
                                                   Additional Prekindergarten Allowance
 Federal Adjusted Gross Income                     Amount

    As used in this section, "federal adjusted gross income" means the federal adjusted gross income
as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of the parent or legal guardian of the
child who has physical custody of the child for more than half the tax year. Federal adjusted gross
income is calculated for the purposes of this section as the tax year beginning two years before the
year in which the eligible parent or legal guardian is notified of the prekindergarten allowance. For
the purposes of this section a custodial parent's adjusted gross income includes the adjusted gross
income of the parent's spouse if the parent is considered to be married for income tax purposes under
section 7703 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
   Subd. 3. Commissioner of education duties. (a) The commissioner of education shall review
1542                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [40TH DAY

the data provided by the Department of Revenue under section 270C.135. By January 31, 2008,
and each subsequent year, the commissioner shall submit the prekindergarten education allowance
to each eligible recipient. The commissioner shall notify the parent or legal guardian of an eligible
child of the amount of the prekindergarten education allowance available. Notification must include
instructions on how to use the allowance to obtain eligible services and a list of approved providers
in the area.
    (b) The commissioner of education must align the data provided by the Department of Revenue
with the applications received according to subdivision 4 to ensure that persons eligible to receive
a prekindergarten education allowance are not counted more than once. In the event that an
eligible recipient is included in the Department of Revenue data and the alternative process under
subdivision 4, the commissioner shall use the data from the Department of Revenue for the
purposes of establishing prekindergarten education allowance eligibility and amount.
    (c) The commissioner shall establish a process to transfer the prekindergarten education
allowance to recipients. The department may utilize technology to transfer the prekindergarten
education allowance through e-mail or other methods to reduce costs. Recipients may not transfer
allowances to another person.
    (d) Each prekindergarten education allowance shall have the monetary value stated for each
eligible child. The prekindergarten allowance may not be used to purchase services until September
1 of the year in which the allowance is issued following its transmission to eligible recipients. In
the event that a recipient moves during the year in which a prekindergarten education allowance
is valid, the recipient may apply to the department to split or divide the prekindergarten education
allowance among two or more providers.
    (e) The commissioner must review and approve work plan amendments from federally
designated Head Start grantees and school district programs that meet the criteria in subdivision 8
and state the methods in which the grantees or programs will expand or enhance services beyond
levels that are funded through specific state or federal appropriations for these purposes.
    Subd. 4. Alternative process. The commissioner of education, in conjunction with the
commissioner of human services, shall establish a method to locate potential recipients who
do not file income taxes and inform them of the availability of the prekindergarten education
allowance. For the purpose of establishing eligibility for the prekindergarten education allowance,
the commissioners of education and human services must accept recipients identified in other
public funding eligibility processes, including, but not limited to, public school programs, Head
Start, and child care assistance programs. In addition, the commissioners of education and human
services must make a sample form available to providers that can be used to determine eligibility
of potential recipients. The commissioner must submit a prekindergarten education allowance to
an eligible recipient who used the alternative processes.
    Subd. 5. Redeeming an allowance. (a) A recipient who has received a prekindergarten education
allowance may transmit the allowance provided in subdivision 3 or subdivision 4 to pay for services
provided to the recipient's eligible dependent child from September 1 of that year through August 31
of the following year in an approved early childhood education and care program or by an approved
early childhood education and care provider as defined in subdivision 8.
    (b) An eligible provider or program that has provided services under subdivision 7 to an
eligible child whose parent or guardian received a prekindergarten education allowance, must
40TH DAY]                        THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007                                      1543

remit the allowance to the Department of Education in a manner determined by the commissioner
of education.
    Subd. 6. Payments to approved programs. The commissioner shall reimburse providers or
programs that received a prekindergarten education allowance from a recipient on behalf of an
eligible three- or four-year-old child on a reimbursement basis for services provided from September
1 to August 31. An eligible provider that accepts prekindergarten education allowance as a form of
payment for services must maintain documentation of services provided and the commissioner must
verify information submitted by eligible providers to ensure appropriate services were provided to
eligible recipients for whom the early childhood allowances were used as a form of payment.
    Subd. 7. Use of allowance. The prekindergarten education allowance may only be used for
services designed to promote school readiness in an approved quality early childhood care and
education setting according to subdivision 8, that are provided to an eligible child who is at least
age three and has not yet reached age five on August 31 of the year in which the allowance is issued.
   Subd. 8. Provider certification. (a) A quality early care and education setting is any service
or program that receives a quality rating from the Department of Human Services under the
Minnesota Early Learning Foundation quality rating system administered by the Department of
Human Services and agrees to accept a prekindergarten education allowance to pay for services.
For allowances issued in 2008 only, a provider may satisfy the quality rating system requirements
and be deemed eligible to participate in this program if the provider has received a provisional
quality rating system approved from either the Department of Education or the Department of
Human Services.
    (b) For the purposes of receiving a provisional quality rating, a child care program or provider
must be approved by the commissioner of human services and a school district or a Head Start
program must be approved by the commissioner of education. Programs and providers must apply
for approval in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioners. To receive approval, the
commissioners must determine that applicants:
   (1) use research-based curricula that are aligned with the education standards, under section
120B.021, instruction and child assessment instruments approved by the Departments of Education
and Human Services, in consultation with the Minnesota Early Learning Foundation;
    (2) provide a program of sufficient intensity and duration to improve the school readiness of
participating children;
   (3) provide opportunities for parent involvement; and
   (4) meet other research-based criteria determined necessary by the commissioners.
   (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), for allowances issued in 2008 only, Head Start programs
meeting Head Start performance standards and accredited child care centers are granted a
provisional quality rating for the purposes of receiving a prekindergarten education allowance
under this section.
    (d) A provider deemed eligible to receive a prekindergarten education allowance under
paragraphs (a) to (c) may use the allowance to enhance services above the current quality levels,
increase the duration of services provided, or expand the number of children to whom services are
provided beyond levels that are funded through specific state or federal appropriations for these
1544                                  JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                       [40TH DAY

purposes.
    (e) For allowances issued in 2008 and 2009 only, when no quality program is available, a
recipient may direct the prekindergarten education allowance to a provider or program for school
readiness quality improvements that will make the provider or program eligible for a quality rating
according to the quality rating system. Allowable expenditures that will increase the capacity of
the provider or program to help children to be ready for kindergarten include purchase of curricula
and assessment tools, as described in paragraph (b), clause (1), professional development and
training on the area of curricula and assessment tools, purchase of materials to improve the learning
environment, and other expenditures preapproved by the commissioner of human services for child
care providers and the commissioner of education for school district programs.
    Subd. 9. Allowance not income for purposes of other publicly funded programs.
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the prekindergarten education allowance issued to the
parent or guardian of an eligible child does not count as earned income for purposes of the medical
assistance, MinnesotaCare, MFIP, school readiness, Head Start, or child care assistance programs.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.

a significant barrier to college access that

community colleges, technical colleges,
and consolidated community and technical
colleges.

    (ii) The amount of income to be assigned to Minnesota for an individual who is a nonresident,
and who is an athlete or entertainer not listed in clause (i), for that person's athletic or entertainment
performance in Minnesota shall be determined by assigning to this state all income from

    (3) For purposes of this section, amounts received by a nonresident as "retirement income" as
defined in section (b)(1) of the State Income Taxation of Pension Income Act, Public Law 104-95,
are not considered income derived from carrying on a trade or business or from wages or other
compensation for work an employee performed in Minnesota, and are not taxable under this chapter.

    Gain on the sale of a partnership interest is allocable to this state in the ratio of the original
cost of partnership tangible property in this state to the original cost of partnership tangible
property everywhere, determined at the time of the sale. If more than 50 percent of the value of
the partnership's assets consists of intangibles, gain or loss from the sale of the partnership interest
is allocated to this state in accordance with the sales factor of the partnership for its first full
tax period immediately preceding the tax period of the partnership during which the partnership
interest was sold.
   Gain on the sale of goodwill or income from a covenant not to compete that is connected with
a business operating all or partially in Minnesota is allocated to this state to the extent that the
income from the business in the year preceding the year of sale was assignable to Minnesota under
subdivision 3.
    When an employer pays an employee for a covenant not to compete, the income allocated to this
state is in the ratio of the employee's service in Minnesota in the calendar year preceding leaving the
employment of the employer over the total services performed by the employee for the employer in
that year.
    (d) Income from winnings on a bet made by an individual while in Minnesota is assigned to this
state. In this paragraph, "bet" has the meaning given in section 609.75, subdivision 2, as limited by
section 609.75, subdivision 3, clauses (1), (2), and (3).

    (b) A contractor or a third-party bulk filer acting on behalf of a contractor, who makes payments
to an individual, carrying on a trade or business described above as a sole proprietorship, must
deduct and withhold two percent of the payment as Minnesota withholding tax when the amount
the contractor paid to that individual during the calendar year exceeds $600.
    (c) A payment subject to withholding under this subdivision must be treated as if the payment
were a wage paid by an employer to an employee. The requirements in the definitions of "employee"
and "employer" in subdivision 1 relating to geographic location apply in determining whether
withholding tax applies under this subdivision, but without regard to whether the contractor or
the individual otherwise satisfy the definition of an employer or an employee. Each recipient of a
payment subject to withholding under this subdivision must furnish the contractor with a statement
of the recipient's name, address, and Social Security account number.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for payments made after July 31, 2007.

   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.34, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 3a. Transactions without economic substance. (a) When any person, directly or
indirectly, engages in a transaction or series of transactions without economic substance to create
a loss or to reduce taxable income or to increase credits allowed in determining Minnesota tax,
the commissioner must determine the amount of a taxpayer's taxable income or tax so as to reflect
what would have been the taxpayer's taxable income or tax but for the transaction or transactions
without economic substance causing the reduction in taxable income or tax.
   (b) A transaction has economic substance only if a taxpayer shows by clear and convincing

evidence:
    (1) the transaction changes in a meaningful way (apart from federal, state, local, and foreign tax
effects) the taxpayer's economic position; and
    (2) the taxpayer has a substantial nontax purpose for entering into a transaction and the
transaction is a reasonable means of accomplishing the substantial nontax purpose.
A transaction does not have a substantial nontax purpose if it does not have a potential for profit. A
transaction has a substantial nontax purpose when the taxpayer reasonably expects that the pretax
profit for the transaction is substantial in relation to the present value of the expected net tax benefits
that would be allowed if the transaction were respected for tax purposes, and the reasonably expected
pretax profit from the transaction exceeds the risk-free rate of return.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,
2006.
   Sec. 6. PURPOSE AND EFFECT.
   It is the intent of the legislature that the provisions of this article must not be construed as
supplanting any existing Minnesota law.

    A retailer who does not maintain a place of business within this state as defined by section

property is sold and the purchaser changes its use in a manner that would result in a change of
classification of the property, the study must take into account that changed classification as soon

States Government Form DD214 or other official military discharge papers, and must be certified

    (b) If a disabled veteran qualifying for exemption under paragraph (a) predeceases the veteran's
spouse, and if upon the death of the veteran the spouse holds the legal or beneficial title to the
homestead and permanently resides there, the exemption from taxation shall carry over to the benefit
of the veteran's spouse until the spouse remarries or sells or otherwise disposes of the property.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for special assessments levied after May 31,
2007, or, as applied to special assessments levied before June 1, 2007, to property that initially
qualifies for valuation under section 273.111, for taxes levied in 2007.
  Sec. 16. [273.1115] AGGREGATE RESOURCE PRESERVATION PROPERTY TAX
LAW.
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. Real estate is entitled to valuation under this section only if all
of the following requirements are met:
      (1) the property is classified 1a, 1b, 2a, or 2b property under section 273.13, subdivisions 22 and
23;
      (2) the property is at least ten contiguous acres, when the application is filed under subdivision
2;
    (3) the owner has filed a completed application for deferment as specified in subdivision 2 with
the county assessor in the county in which the property is located;
      (4) there are no delinquent taxes on the property; and
      (5) a covenant on the land restricts its use as provided in subdivision 2, clause (4).
   Subd. 2. Application. Application for valuation deferment under this section must be filed by
May 1 of the assessment year. Any application filed and granted continues in effect for subsequent
years until the property no longer qualifies, provided that supplemental affidavits under subdivision
40TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007                                       1601

6 are timely filed. The application must be filed with the assessor of the county in which the real
property is located on such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner of revenue. The
application must be executed and acknowledged in the manner required by law to execute and
acknowledge a deed and must contain at least the following information and any other information
the commissioner deems necessary:
   (1) the legal description of the area;
   (2) the name and address of owner;
    (3) a copy of the affidavit filed under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h), in the case
of property classified class 2b, clause (5); or in the case of property classified 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b,
clauses (1) to (3), the application must include a similar document with the same information as
contained in the affidavit under section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h); and
    (4) a statement of proof from the owner that the land contains a restrictive covenant limiting
its use for the property's surface to that which exists on the date of the application and limiting its
future use to the preparation and removal of the aggregate commercial deposit under its surface.
    To qualify under this clause, the covenant must be binding on the owner or the owner's successor
or assignee, and run with the land, except as provided in subdivision 4 allowing for the cancellation
of the covenant under certain conditions.
    Subd. 3. Determination of value. Upon timely application by the owner as provided in
subdivision 2, notwithstanding sections 272.03, subdivision 8, and 273.11, the value of any
qualifying land described in subdivision 2 must be valued as if it were agricultural property, using
a per acre valuation equal to the current year's per acre valuation of agricultural land in the county.
The assessor shall not consider any additional value resulting from potential alternative and future
uses of the property. The buildings located on the land shall be valued by the assessor in the normal
manner.
    Subd. 4. Cancellation of covenant. The covenant required under subdivision 2 may be canceled
in two ways:
    (1) by the owner beginning with the next subsequent assessment year provided that the additional
taxes as determined under subdivision 5 are paid by the owner at the time of cancellation; and
    (2) by the city or town in which the property is located beginning with the next subsequent
assessment year, if the city council or town board:
   (i) changes the conditional use of the property;
   (ii) revokes the mining permit; or
   (iii) changes the zoning to disallow mining.
   No additional taxes are imposed on the property under this clause.
    Subd. 4a. County termination. Within two years of the effective date of this section, a county
may, following notice and public hearing, terminate application of this section in the county. The
termination is effective upon adoption of a resolution of the county board. A county has 60 days
from receipt of the first application for enrollment under this section to notify the applicant and any
1602                                 JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                     [40TH DAY

subsequent applicants of the county's intent to begin the process of terminating application of this
section in the county. The county must act on the termination within six months. Upon termination by
a vote of the county board, all applications received during notification of intent to terminate shall be
deemed void. If the county board does not act on the termination within six months of notification, all
applications for valuation for deferment received shall be deemed eligible to be enrolled under this
section. Following this initial 60-day grace period, a termination applies prospectively and does not
affect property enrolled under this section prior to the termination date. A county may reauthorize
application of this section by a resolution of the county board revoking the termination.
    Subd. 5. Additional taxes. When real property which has been valued and assessed under this
section no longer qualifies, the portion of the land classified under subdivision 1, clause (1), is subject
to additional taxes. The additional tax amount is determined by:
    (1) computing the difference between (i) the current year's taxes determined in accordance with
subdivision 3, and (ii) an amount as determined by the assessor based upon the property's current
year's estimated market value of like real estate at its highest and best use and the appropriate local
tax rate; and
   (2) multiplying the amount determined in clause (1) by the number of years the land was in the
program under this section.
    The current year's estimated market value as determined by the assessor must not exceed the
market value that would result if the property was sold in an arms-length transaction and must not
be greater than it would have been had the actual bona fide sale price of the property been used in
lieu of that market value. The additional taxes must be extended against the property on the tax list
for the current year, except that interest or penalties must not be levied on such additional taxes if
timely paid.
    The additional tax under this subdivision must not be imposed on that portion of the property
which has actively been mined and has been removed from the program based upon the supplemental
affidavits filed under subdivision 6.
    Subd. 6. Supplemental affidavits; mining activity on land. When any portion of the property
begins to be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the
day any aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being
mined. The acres actively being mined shall be (1) valued and classified under section 273.13,
subdivision 24, in the next subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource
preservation property tax program under this section. The additional taxes under subdivision 5 must
not be imposed on the acres that are actively being mined and have been removed from the program
under this section.
    Copies of the original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county
assessor, the local zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land
and Minerals. A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property
is actively mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining
activity constitutes less than five acres. Failure to file the affidavits timely shall result in the property
losing its valuation deferment under this section, and additional taxes must be imposed as calculated
under subdivision 5.
    Subd. 7. Lien. The additional tax imposed by this section is a lien upon the property assessed to

the same extent and for the same duration as other taxes imposed upon property within this state and,
when collected, must be distributed in the manner provided by law for the collection and distribution
of other property taxes.
    Subd. 8. Continuation of tax treatment upon sale. When real property qualifying under
subdivision 1 is sold, additional taxes must not be extended against the property if the property
continues to qualify under subdivision 1, and the new owner files an application with the assessor
for continued deferment within 30 days after the sale.
   Subd. 9. Definitions. For purposes of this section, "commercial aggregate deposit" and "actively
mined" have the meanings given them in section 273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (h).
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2008, payable in 2009, and
thereafter, except that for the 2008 assessment year, the application date under subdivision 4 shall
be September 1, 2008, and subdivision 4a is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 17. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.112, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Requirements. Real estate shall be entitled to valuation and tax deferment under this
section only if it is:
   (a) actively and exclusively devoted to golf, skiing, lawn bowling, croquet, polo, soccer, or
archery or firearms range recreational use or other recreational uses carried on at the establishment;
     (b) five acres in size or more, except in the case of a lawn bowling or croquet green or an archery
or firearms range;
    (c)(1) operated by private individuals or, in the case of a lawn bowling or croquet green, by
private individuals or corporations, and open to the public; or
   (2) operated by firms or corporations for the benefit of employees or guests; or
    (3) operated by private clubs having a membership of 50 or more or open to the public, provided
that the club does not discriminate in membership requirements or selection on the basis of sex or
marital status; and
    (d) made available for use in the case of real estate devoted to golf without discrimination on
the basis of sex during the time when the facility is open to use by the public or by members, except
that use for golf may be restricted on the basis of sex no more frequently than one, or part of one,
weekend each calendar month for each sex and no more than two, or part of two, weekdays each
week for each sex.
    If a golf club membership allows use of golf course facilities by more than one adult per
membership, the use must be equally available to all adults entitled to use of the golf course under
the membership, except that use may be restricted on the basis of sex as permitted in this section.
Memberships that permit play during restricted times may be allowed only if the restricted times
apply to all adults using the membership. A golf club may not offer a membership or golfing
privileges to a spouse of a member that provides greater or less access to the golf course than is
provided to that person's spouse under the same or a separate membership in that club, except that
the terms of a membership may provide that one spouse may have no right to use the golf course at
any time while the other spouse may have either limited or unlimited access to the golf course.

    A golf club may have or create an individual membership category which entitles a member
for a reduced rate to play during restricted hours as established by the club. The club must have on
record a written request by the member for such membership.
    A golf club that has food or beverage facilities or services must allow equal access to those
facilities and services for both men and women members in all membership categories at all times.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require service or access to facilities to persons
under the age of 21 years or require any act that would violate law or ordinance regarding sale,
consumption, or regulation of alcoholic beverages.
   For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 7a, discrimination means a pattern or course of
conduct and not linked to an isolated incident.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2007, payable in 2008, and
thereafter.

   Sec. 19. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.123, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
   Subd. 7. Local option; other property. The owner of homestead property not qualifying for an
adjustment in valuation pursuant to subdivisions 1 to 5 or of nonhomestead property may receive a
reduction in the amount of taxes payable on the property for the year in which the destruction occurs
and in the following year if:
    (a) 50 percent or more of the homestead dwelling or other structure, as established by the county
assessor, is (i) unintentionally or accidentally destroyed, or (ii) destroyed by arson or vandalism,
by someone other than the owner, and the homestead is uninhabitable or the other structure is not
usable;
    (b) the owner of the property makes written application to the county assessor as soon as practical
after the damage has occurred; and
   (c) the owner of the property makes written application to the county board.
    The county board may grant a reduction in the amount of property tax which the owner must
pay on the qualifying property in the year of destruction and in the following year. Any reduction
in the amount of tax payable which is authorized by county board action shall be calculated based

upon the number of months that the home is uninhabitable or the other structure is unusable. The
amount of net tax due from the taxpayer shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of months the dwelling was occupied by that taxpayer, or the number of months the
other structure was used by the taxpayer, and the denominator of which is 12. For purposes of this
subdivision, if a structure is occupied or used for a fraction of a month, it is considered a month. "Net
tax" is defined as the amount of tax after the subtraction of all of the state paid property tax credits.
If application is made following payment of all property taxes due for the year of destruction, the
amount of the reduction granted by the county board shall be refunded to the taxpayer by the county
treasurer as soon as practical.
   Any reductions or refunds approved by the county board shall not be subject to approval by the
commissioner of revenue.
   The county board may levy in the following year the amount of tax dollars lost to the county
government as a result of the reductions granted pursuant to this subdivision.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for destruction that occurs in calendar year 2006
and thereafter.

    (­) The limitation in this section does not apply to buildings containing fewer than four
residential units or to a single rented or leased dwelling unit located within or attached to a private
garage or similar structure owned by the owner of a homestead and located on the premises of
that homestead. If the assessor has classified a property as both homestead and nonhomestead, the
reductions in tax provided under sections 273.135 and 273.1391 apply to the value of both the
homestead and the nonhomestead portions of the property.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2007, payable in 2008, and
thereafter.
    Sec. 21. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 22. Annual registration of certain relative homesteads. If the owner of property or
the owner's relative who occupies property that is classified as a homestead under subdivision 1,
paragraph (c), receives compensation for allowing occupancy of any part of that property for a
period that exceeds 31 consecutive days during the calendar year, the recipient of the compensation
must register the property with the city in which it is located no later than 60 days after the initial
rental period began. This requirement applies to property located in a city that has a population over

25,000. Each city must maintain a file of these property registrations that is open to the public, and
retain the registrations for one year after the date of filing.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective July 1, 2007.
   Sec. 22. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.125, subdivision 8, is amended to read:
    Subd. 8. Manufactured homes; sectional structures. (a) In this section, "manufactured home"
means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis, and
designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities, and contains the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems in
it. Manufactured home includes any accessory structure that is an addition or supplement to the
manufactured home and, when installed, becomes a part of the manufactured home.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), a manufactured home that meets each of the following
criteria must be valued and assessed as an improvement to real property, the appropriate real property
classification applies, and the valuation is subject to review and the taxes payable in the manner
provided for real property:
   (1) the owner of the unit holds title to the land on which it is situated;
    (2) the unit is affixed to the land by a permanent foundation or is installed at its location in
accordance with the Manufactured Home Building Code in sections 327.31 to 327.34, and rules
adopted under those sections, or is affixed to the land like other real property in the taxing district;
and
   (3) the unit is connected to public utilities, has a well and septic tank system, or is serviced by
water and sewer facilities comparable to other real property in the taxing district.
    (c) A manufactured home that meets each of the following criteria must be assessed at the rate
provided by the appropriate real property classification but must be treated as personal property, and
the valuation is subject to review and the taxes payable in the manner provided in this section:
    (1) the owner of the unit is a lessee of the land under the terms of a lease, or the unit is located
in a manufactured home park but is not the homestead of the park owner;
    (2) the unit is affixed to the land by a permanent foundation or is installed at its location in
accordance with the Manufactured Home Building Code contained in sections 327.31 to 327.34,
and the rules adopted under those sections, or is affixed to the land like other real property in the
taxing district; and
   (3) the unit is connected to public utilities, has a well and septic tank system, or is serviced by
water and sewer facilities comparable to other real property in the taxing district.
    (d) Sectional structures must be valued and assessed as an improvement to real property if the
owner of the structure holds title to the land on which it is located or is a qualifying lessee of the land
under section 273.19. In this paragraph "sectional structure" means a building or structural unit that
has been in whole or substantial part manufactured or constructed at an off-site location to be wholly
or partially assembled on-site alone or with other units and attached to a permanent foundation.
    (e) The commissioner of revenue may adopt rules under the Administrative Procedure Act to
establish additional criteria for the classification of manufactured homes and sectional structures

income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph.
    Property is classified and assessed pursuant to clause (1) only if the commissioner of revenue
certifies to the assessor that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $32,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
    (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real property that abuts a lakeshore line and is devoted
to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to
commercial purposes for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and
that includes a portion used as a homestead by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as
a homestead by a shareholder of a corporation that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that
owns the resort, or a member of a limited liability company that owns the resort even if the title to
the homestead is held by the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes
of this clause, property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the
property, excluding the portion used exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy

and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. The portion of the property used as a homestead
is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the property is classified as follows:
the first $500,000 of market value is tier I, the next $1,700,000 of market value is tier II, and any
remaining market value is tier III. The class rates for class 1c are: tier I, 0.55 percent; tier II, 1.0
percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. If a class 1c resort property has any market value in tier III, the
entire property must meet the requirements of subdivision 25, paragraph (d), clause (1), to qualify
for class 1c treatment under this paragraph.
      (d) Class 1d property includes structures that meet all of the following criteria:
   (1) the structure is located on property that is classified as agricultural property under section
273.13, subdivision 23;
   (2) the structure is occupied exclusively by seasonal farm workers during the time when they
work on that farm, and the occupants are not charged rent for the privilege of occupying the property,
provided that use of the structure for storage of farm equipment and produce does not disqualify the
property from classification under this paragraph;
      (3) the structure meets all applicable health and safety requirements for the appropriate season;
and
   (4) the structure is not salable as residential property because it does not comply with local
ordinances relating to location in relation to streets or roads.
   The market value of class 1d property has the same class rates as class 1a property under
paragraph (a).
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for assessment year 2007 and thereafter, for taxes
payable in 2008 and thereafter.
      Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
    Subd. 23. Class 2. (a) Class 2a property is agricultural land including any improvements that is
homesteaded. The market value of the house and garage and immediately surrounding one acre of
land has the same class rates as class 1a property under subdivision 22. The value of the remaining
land including improvements up to the first tier valuation limit of agricultural homestead property
has a net class rate of ­
                        0­5  ­ 0.5 percent of market value. The remaining property over the first tier has
                          .­ 5
a class rate of one percent of market value. For purposes of this subdivision, the "first tier valuation

airport; or (4) land with a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively being mined and is not
otherwise classified as class 2a or 2b, clauses (1) to (3). Class 2b property has a net class rate of one
percent of market value, except that property described in clause (1) has a net class rate of .55 percent
if it consists of no more than 1,920 acres and is being managed under a forest management plan
that meets the requirements of chapter 290C, but is not enrolled in the sustainable forest resource
management incentive program, provided that the owner of the property must apply to the assessor
annually to receive the reduced class rate and provide the information required by the assessor to
verify that the property qualifies for the reduced rate.
    (c) Agricultural land as used in this section means contiguous acreage of ten acres or more,
used during the preceding year for agricultural purposes. "Agricultural purposes" as used in this
section means the raising or cultivation of agricultural products. "Agricultural purposes" also
includes enrollment in the Reinvest in Minnesota program under sections 103F.501 to 103F.535
or the federal Conservation Reserve Program as contained in Public Law 99-198 if the property
was classified as agricultural (i) under this subdivision for the assessment year 2002 or (ii) in the
year prior to its enrollment. Contiguous acreage on the same parcel, or contiguous acreage on an
immediately adjacent parcel under the same ownership, may also qualify as agricultural land, but
only if it is pasture, timber, waste, unusable wild land, or land included in state or federal farm
programs. Agricultural classification for property shall be determined excluding the house, garage,
and immediately surrounding one acre of land, and shall not be based upon the market value of any
residential structures on the parcel or contiguous parcels under the same ownership.
    (d) Real estate, excluding the house, garage, and immediately surrounding one acre of land, of
less than ten acres which is exclusively and intensively used for raising or cultivating agricultural
products, shall be considered as agricultural land.
   Land shall be classified as agricultural even if all or a portion of the agricultural use of that
property is the leasing to, or use by another person for agricultural purposes.
   Classification under this subdivision is not determinative for qualifying under section 273.111.
    The property classification under this section supersedes, for property tax purposes only, any
locally administered agricultural policies or land use restrictions that define minimum or maximum
farm acreage.
   (e) The term "agricultural products" as used in this subdivision includes production for sale of:
   (1) livestock, dairy animals, dairy products, poultry and poultry products, fur-bearing animals,
horticultural and nursery stock, fruit of all kinds, vegetables, forage, grains, bees, and apiary
products by the owner;
   (2) fish bred for sale and consumption if the fish breeding occurs on land zoned for agricultural
use;
    (3) the commercial boarding of horses if the boarding is done in conjunction with raising or
cultivating agricultural products as defined in clause (1);
    (4) property which is owned and operated by nonprofit organizations used for equestrian
activities, excluding racing;
   (5) game birds and waterfowl bred and raised for use on a shooting preserve licensed under

section 97A.115;
   (6) insects primarily bred to be used as food for animals;
   (7) trees, grown for sale as a crop, including short rotation woody crops, and not sold for timber,
lumber, wood, or wood products; and
   (8) maple syrup taken from trees grown by a person licensed by the Minnesota Department of
Agriculture under chapter 28A as a food processor.
    (f) If a parcel used for agricultural purposes is also used for commercial or industrial purposes,
including but not limited to:
   (1) wholesale and retail sales;
   (2) processing of raw agricultural products or other goods;
   (3) warehousing or storage of processed goods; and
   (4) office facilities for the support of the activities enumerated in clauses (1), (2), and (3),
the assessor shall classify the part of the parcel used for agricultural purposes as class 1b, 2a, or 2b,
whichever is appropriate, and the remainder in the class appropriate to its use. The grading, sorting,
and packaging of raw agricultural products for first sale is considered an agricultural purpose. A
greenhouse or other building where horticultural or nursery products are grown that is also used for
the conduct of retail sales must be classified as agricultural if it is primarily used for the growing
of horticultural or nursery products from seed, cuttings, or roots and occasionally as a showroom
for the retail sale of those products. Use of a greenhouse or building only for the display of already
grown horticultural or nursery products does not qualify as an agricultural purpose.
    The assessor shall determine and list separately on the records the market value of the
homestead dwelling and the one acre of land on which that dwelling is located. If any farm
buildings or structures are located on this homesteaded acre of land, their market value shall not be
included in this separate determination.
    (g) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), a privately owned public use
airport must be licensed as a public airport under section 360.018. For purposes of paragraph (b),
clause (4), "landing area" means that part of a privately owned public use airport properly cleared,
regularly maintained, and made available to the public for use by aircraft and includes runways,
taxiways, aprons, and sites upon which are situated landing or navigational aids. A landing area
also includes land underlying both the primary surface and the approach surfaces that comply with
all of the following:
    (i) the land is properly cleared and regularly maintained for the primary purposes of the landing,
taking off, and taxiing of aircraft; but that portion of the land that contains facilities for servicing,
repair, or maintenance of aircraft is not included as a landing area;
   (ii) the land is part of the airport property; and
   (iii) the land is not used for commercial or residential purposes.
The land contained in a landing area under paragraph (b), clause (4), must be described and certified
1612                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [40TH DAY

by the commissioner of transportation. The certification is effective until it is modified, or until the
airport or landing area no longer meets the requirements of paragraph (b), clause (4). For purposes
of paragraph (b), clause (4), "public access area" means property used as an aircraft parking ramp,
apron, or storage hangar, or an arrival and departure building in connection with the airport.
   (h) To qualify for classification under paragraph (b), clause (4), the property must be at least ten
contiguous acres in size and the owner of the property must record with the county recorder of the
county in which the property is located an affidavit containing:
   (1) a legal description of the property;
   (2) a disclosure that the property contains a commercial aggregate deposit that is not actively
being mined but is present on the entire parcel enrolled;
   (3) documentation that the conditional use under the county or local zoning ordinance of this
property is for mining; and
    (4) documentation that a permit has been issued by the local unit of government or the mining
activity is allowed under local ordinance. The disclosure must include a statement from a registered
professional geologist, engineer, or soil scientist delineating the deposit and certifying that it is a
commercial aggregate deposit.
   For purposes of this section and section 273.1115, "commercial aggregate deposit" means a
deposit that will yield crushed stone or sand and gravel that is suitable for use as a construction
aggregate; and "actively mined" means the removal of top soil and overburden in preparation for
excavation or excavation of a commercial deposit.
    (i) When any portion of the property under this subdivision or section 273.13, subdivision 22,
begins to be actively mined, the owner must file a supplemental affidavit within 60 days from the
day any aggregate is removed stating the number of acres of the property that is actively being
mined. The acres actively being mined must be (1) valued and classified under section 273.13,
subdivision 24, in the next subsequent assessment year, and (2) removed from the aggregate resource
preservation property tax program under section 273.1115, if the land was enrolled in that program.
Copies of the original affidavit and all supplemental affidavits must be filed with the county assessor,
the local zoning administrator, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Land and
Minerals. A supplemental affidavit must be filed each time a subsequent portion of the property is
actively mined, provided that the minimum acreage change is five acres, even if the actual mining
activity constitutes less than five acres.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2007, payable in 2008, and
thereafter, except that paragraph (b), clause (4), is effective for taxes levied in 2008, payable in
2009, and thereafter.
   Sec. 26. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 24, is amended to read:
    Subd. 24. Class 3. (a) Commercial and industrial property and utility real and personal property
is class 3a.
    (1) Except as otherwise provided, each parcel of commercial, industrial, or utility real property
has a class rate of 1.5 percent of the first tier of market value, and 2.0 percent of the remaining market
value. In the case of contiguous parcels of property owned by the same person or entity, only the

value equal to the first-tier value of the contiguous parcels qualifies for the reduced class rate, except
that contiguous parcels owned by the same person or entity shall be eligible for the first-tier value
class rate on each separate business operated by the owner of the property, provided the business
is housed in a separate structure. For the purposes of this subdivision, the first tier means the first
$150,000 of market value. Real property owned in fee by a utility for transmission line right-of-way
shall be classified at the class rate for the higher tier.
    For purposes of this subdivision, parcels are considered to be contiguous even if they are
separated from each other by a road, street, waterway, or other similar intervening type of property.
Connections between parcels that consist of power lines or pipelines do not cause the parcels to
be contiguous. Property owners who have contiguous parcels of property that constitute separate
businesses that may qualify for the first-tier class rate shall notify the assessor by July 1, for
treatment beginning in the following taxes payable year.

3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.
     Class 4d property has a class rate of 0.75 percent.

   Subd. 33. Classification of unimproved property. (a) All real property that is not improved
with a structure must be classified according to its current use.
    (b) Except as provided in subdivision 23, paragraph (b), clause (1), real property that is not
improved with a structure and for which there is no identifiable current use must be classified
according to its highest and best use permitted under the local zoning ordinance. If the ordinance
permits more than one use, the land must be classified according to the highest and best use permitted
under the ordinance. If no such ordinance exists, the assessor shall consider the most likely potential
use of the unimproved land based upon the use made of surrounding land or land in proximity to
the unimproved land.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 97A.061, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Allocation. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 3, the county treasurer shall allocate
the payment among the county, towns, and school districts on the same basis as if the payments were
taxes on the land received in the year. Payment of a town's or a school district's allocation must be
made by the county treasurer to the town or school district within 30 days of receipt of the payment
to the county. The county's share of the payment shall be deposited in the county general revenue
fund.
   (b) The county treasurer of a county with a population over 39,000 but less than 42,000 in the
1950 federal census shall allocate the payment only among the towns and school districts on the
same basis as if the payments were taxes on the lands received in the current year.
    (c) If a town received a payment in calendar year 2006 or thereafter under this subdivision, and
subsequently incorporated as a city, the city will continue to receive any future year's allocations
that would have been made to the town had it not incorporated, provided that the payments will
terminate if the governing body of the city passes an ordinance that prohibits hunting within the
boundaries of the city.

zero. In the case of an agricultural or resort homestead, only the market value of the house, garage,
and immediately surrounding one acre of land is eligible in determining the property's homestead
credit. In the case of a property that is classified as part homestead and part nonhomestead, (i) the
credit shall apply only to the homestead portion of the property, but (ii) if a portion of a property
is classified as nonhomestead solely because not all the owners occupy the property, not all the
owners have qualifying relatives occupying the property, or solely because not all the spouses of
owners occupy the property, the credit amount shall be initially computed as if that nonhomestead
portion were also in the homestead class and then prorated to the owner-occupant's percentage of
ownership. For the purpose of this section, when an owner-occupant's spouse does not occupy the
property, the percentage of ownership for the owner-occupant spouse is one-half of the couple's
ownership percentage.

No city may have a formula aid amount less than zero. The need increase percentage must be the
same for all cities.
    The applicable need increase percentage must be calculated by the Department of Revenue so
that the total of the aid under subdivision 9 equals the total amount available for aid under section
477A.03 after the subtraction under section 477A.014, subdivisions 4 and 5.

tax-exempt Indian land, the city's maximum allowed aid increase under paragraph (b) shall be
increased by an amount equal to (1) the city's tax rate in the year of the aid calculation, multiplied
by (2) the amount of its net tax capacity decrease resulting from the property becoming tax exempt.

subdivision 5, 40 percent of the total payment to the county shall be deposited in the county general
revenue fund to be used to provide property tax levy reduction. The remainder shall be distributed
by the county in the following priority:
    (a) 37.5 cents, as adjusted for inflation under section 477A.145, for each acre of
county-administered other natural resources land shall be deposited in a resource development
fund to be created within the county treasury for use in resource development, forest management,

county-administered other natural resources land. Any county receiving less than $5,000 annually
for the resource development fund may elect to deposit that amount in the county general revenue
fund;
    (b) From the funds remaining, within 30 days of receipt of the payment to the county, the
county treasurer shall pay each organized township 30 cents, as adjusted for inflation under section
477A.145, for each acre of acquired natural resources land, each acre of land utilization project
land located entirely within a wildlife management area, and each acre of land described in section

land not located within a wildlife management area, located within its boundaries. Payments for
natural resources lands not located in an organized township shall be deposited in the county
general revenue fund. Payments to counties and townships pursuant to this paragraph shall be used
to provide property tax levy reduction, except that of the payments for natural resources lands not
located in an organized township, the county may allocate the amount determined to be necessary
for maintenance of roads in unorganized townships. Provided that, if the total payment to the
county pursuant to section 477A.12 is not sufficient to fully fund the distribution provided for
in this clause, the amount available shall be distributed to each township and the county general
revenue fund on a pro rata basis; and
     (c) Any remaining funds shall be deposited in the county general revenue fund. Provided that,
if the distribution to the county general revenue fund exceeds $35,000, the excess shall be used to

   Sec. 18. STUDY OF AIDS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.
    The chairs of the senate and house of representatives committees on taxes shall each appoint
five members to a study group of the tax committees to examine the current system of aids to local
governments and make recommendations on improvements to the system. Of the five members
appointed by each chair, two must be members of the tax committee, one who is a majority party
member and one who is a minority party member. The remaining members must represent local units
of government. The chairs of the divisions of the tax committees having jurisdiction over property
taxes shall also be members and shall serve as cochairs of the study group. The group must report
on its specific recommendations to the legislature by December 15, 2007.

   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276A.01, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
     Subd. 3. Commercial-industrial property. "Commercial-industrial property" means the
following categories of property, as defined in section 273.13, excluding that portion of the property
(i) that may, by law, constitute the tax base for a tax increment pledged pursuant to section 469.042
or 469.162 or sections 469.174 to 469.178, certification of which was requested prior to May 1,
1996, to the extent and while the tax increment is so pledged; or (ii) that is exempt from taxation
under section 272.02:

   (1) that portion of class 5 property consisting of unmined iron ore and low-grade iron-bearing
formations as defined in section 273.14, tools, implements, and machinery, except the portion of
high voltage transmission lines, the value of which is deducted from net tax capacity under section
273.425; and
    (2) that portion of class 3 and class 5 property which is either used or zoned for use for any
commercial or industrial purpose, including property that becomes taxable under section 6, except
for such property which is, or, in the case of property under construction, will when completed be
used exclusively for residential occupancy and the provision of services to residential occupants
thereof. Property must be considered as used exclusively for residential occupancy only if each
of not less than 80 percent of its occupied residential units is, or, in the case of property under
construction, will when completed be occupied under an oral or written agreement for occupancy
over a continuous period of not less than 30 days.
   If the classification of property prescribed by section 273.13 is modified by legislative
amendment, the references in this subdivision are to the successor class or classes of property, or
portions thereof, that include the kinds of property designated in this subdivision.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 276A.04, is amended to read:
   276A.04 INCREASE IN NET TAX CAPACITY.
    By July 15 of 1997 and each subsequent year, the auditor of each county in the area shall
determine the amount, if any, by which the net tax capacity determined in the preceding year
pursuant to section 276A.03, of commercial-industrial property subject to taxation within each
municipality in the county exceeds the net tax capacity in 1995 of commercial-industrial property
subject to taxation within that municipality, including the total net tax capacity of property that
becomes taxable under section 6. If a municipality is located in two or more counties within
the area, the auditors of those counties shall certify the data required by section 276A.03 to the
county auditor responsible for allocating the levies of that municipality between or among the
affected counties. That county auditor shall determine the amount of the net excess, if any, for the
municipality under this section, and certify that amount under section 276A.05. The increase in
total net tax capacity determined by this section must be reduced by the amount of any decreases
in the net tax capacity of commercial-industrial property resulting from any court decisions,
court-related stipulation agreements, or abatements for a prior year, and only in the amount of such
decreases made during the 12-month period ending on May 1 of the current assessment year, where
the decreases, if originally reflected in the determination of a prior year's net tax capacity under
section 276A.03, would have resulted in a smaller contribution from the municipality in that year.
An adjustment for the decreases shall be made only if the municipality made a contribution in a
prior year based on the higher net tax capacity of the commercial-industrial property.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.22, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 5a. Forest trust. The board may purchase forest lands in the taconite assistance area under
section 273.1341 with funds specifically authorized for the purchase. All of these forest lands must
be held in trust for the benefit of the citizens of the area as the Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest.
The board may use the forest trust lands for recreation and economic uses. The board must deposit
the proceeds from the sale of timber or removal of gravel or other minerals from these forest lands
into an Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest account established by the board. By majority vote of
the board, money in the Iron Range Miners' Memorial Forest account may be transferred into the

    Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.227, is amended to read:
    298.227 TACONITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND.
    Subdivision 1. Fund for producers. An amount equal to that distributed pursuant to each
taconite producer's taxable production and qualifying sales under section 298.28, subdivision 9a,
shall be held by the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board in a separate taconite economic
development fund for each taconite and direct reduced ore producer.
    Subd. 2. Committee review. Money from the fund for each producer shall be released by the
commissioner after review by a joint committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of
the salaried employees and the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees of that producer.
The District 11 director of the United States Steelworkers of America, on advice of each local
employee president, shall select the employee members. In nonorganized operations, the employee
committee shall be elected by the nonsalaried production and maintenance employees. The review
must be completed no later than six months after the producer presents a proposal for expenditure
of the funds to the committee.
    Subd. 3. Release of funds. The funds held pursuant to this section may be released only
for acquisition of equipment and facilities for the producer or for research and development in
Minnesota on new mining, or taconite, iron, or steel production technology, but only if the producer
provides a matching expenditure to be used for the same purpose of at least 50 percent of the
distribution based on 14.7 cents per ton ­

   Subd. 4. Limitation. The amount that may be released to a producer under this section in any
year is subject to the following limitation:
    (1) in a calendar year following a calendar year during which the producer's total production is
less than 3,000,000 tons, the maximum distribution is an amount equal to 30.1 cents per ton;
    (2) in a calendar year following a calendar year during which the producer's total production is
at least 3,000,000 tons and less than 8,000,001 tons, the maximum distribution is $903,000; and
    (3) in a calendar year following a calendar year during which the producer's total production is
in excess of 8,000,000 tons, the maximum distribution is $903,000 plus 60.2 cents for every ton by
which the distribution exceeds 8,000,000 tons.
    Subd. 5. Repayment required. If a producer uses money from the fund to procure haulage
trucks, mobile equipment, or mining shovels, and the producer removes the piece of equipment
from the taconite tax relief area defined in section 273.134 within ten years from the date of receipt
of the money from the fund, a portion of the money granted from the fund must be repaid to the
taconite economic development fund. The portion of the money to be repaid is 100 percent of the
grant if the equipment is removed from the taconite tax relief area within 12 months after receipt
of the money from the fund, declining by ten percent for each of the subsequent nine years during
which the equipment remains within the taconite tax relief area.
    Subd. 6. Sale of facility. If a taconite production facility is sold after operations at the facility had
ceased, any money remaining in the fund for the former producer may be released to the purchaser
of the facility on the terms otherwise applicable to the former producer under this section.

    Subd. 7. Other distributions. If a producer fails to provide matching funds for a proposed
expenditure within six months after the commissioner approves release of the funds, the funds are
available for release to another producer in proportion to the distribution provided and under the
conditions of this section. Any portion of the fund which is not released by the commissioner within
two years of its deposit in the fund shall be divided between the taconite environmental protection
fund created in section 298.223 and the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund created
in section 298.292 for placement in their respective special accounts. Two-thirds of the unreleased
funds shall be distributed to the taconite environmental protection fund and one-third to the Douglas
J. Johnson economic protection trust fund.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for distributions in 2008 and thereafter.
   Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.24, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Imposed; calculation. (a) For concentrate produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003,
there is imposed upon taconite and iron sulphides, and upon the mining and quarrying thereof, and
upon the production of iron ore concentrate therefrom, and upon the concentrate so produced, a tax
of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced therefrom. For concentrates
produced in 2005, the tax rate is the same rate imposed for concentrates produced in 2004.
    (b) For concentrates produced in 2006 and subsequent years, the tax rate shall be equal to the
preceding year's tax rate plus an amount equal to the preceding year's tax rate multiplied by the
percentage increase in the implicit price deflator from the fourth quarter of the second preceding
year to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. "Implicit price deflator" means the implicit price
deflator for the gross domestic product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United
States Department of Commerce.
    (c) On concentrates produced in 1997 and thereafter, an additional tax is imposed equal to three
cents per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate for each one percent that the iron content
of the product exceeds 72 percent, when dried at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.
     (d) The tax shall be imposed on the average of the production for the current year and the previous
two years. The rate of the tax imposed will be the current year's tax rate. This clause shall not apply
in the case of the closing of a taconite facility if the property taxes on the facility would be higher
if this clause and section 298.25 were not applicable.
    (e) If the tax or any part of the tax imposed by this subdivision is held to be unconstitutional, a
tax of $2.103 per gross ton of merchantable iron ore concentrate produced shall be imposed.
    (f) Consistent with the intent of this subdivision to impose a tax based upon the weight of
merchantable iron ore concentrate, the commissioner of revenue may indirectly determine the
weight of merchantable iron ore concentrate included in fluxed pellets by subtracting the weight of
the limestone, dolomite, or olivine derivatives or other basic flux additives included in the pellets
from the weight of the pellets. For purposes of this paragraph, "fluxed pellets" are pellets produced
in a process in which limestone, dolomite, olivine, or other basic flux additives are combined with
merchantable iron ore concentrate. No subtraction from the weight of the pellets shall be allowed
for binders, mineral and chemical additives other than basic flux additives, or moisture.
   (g)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, for the first two years of a plant's
commercial production of direct reduced ore, no tax is imposed under this section. As used in this
40TH DAY]                                           THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007                                                                        1641

paragraph, "commercial production" is production of more than 50,000 tons of direct reduced ore
in the current year or in any prior year, "noncommercial production" is production of 50,000 tons
or less of direct reduced ore in any year, and "direct reduced ore" is ore that results in a product that
has an iron content of at least 75 percent. For the third year of a plant's commercial production of
direct reduced ore, the rate to be applied to direct reduced ore is 25 percent of the rate otherwise
determined under this subdivision. For the fourth commercial production year, the rate is 50 percent
of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; for the fifth commercial production year,
the rate is 75 percent of the rate otherwise determined under this subdivision; and for all subsequent
commercial production years, the full rate is imposed.
    (2) Subject to clause (1), production of direct reduced ore in this state is subject to the tax imposed
by this section, but if that production is not produced by a producer of taconite or iron sulfides, the
production of taconite or iron sulfides consumed in the production of direct reduced iron in this state
is not subject to the tax imposed by this section on taconite or iron sulfides.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, no tax is imposed on direct reduced
ore under this section during the facility's noncommercial production of direct reduced ore. The
taconite or iron sulphides consumed in the noncommercial production of direct reduced ore is subject
to the tax imposed by this section on taconite and iron sulphides. Three-year average production of
direct reduced ore does not include production of direct reduced ore in any noncommercial year.
Three-year average production for a direct reduced ore facility that has noncommercial production is
the average of the commercial production of direct reduced ore for the current year and the previous
two commercial years.
   (4) This paragraph applies only to plants for which all environmental permits have been obtained
and construction has begun before January 1, 2009.
      Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.25, is amended to read:
      298.25 TAXES ADDITIONAL TO OCCUPATION TAX; IN LIEU OF OTHER TAXES.
     The taxes imposed under section 298.24 shall be in addition to the occupation tax imposed
upon the business of mining and producing iron ore. Except as herein otherwise provided, such
taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes upon such taconite, iron sulphides, and direct reduced ore or
the lands in which they are contained, or upon the mining or quarrying thereof, or the production
of concentrate or direct reduced ore therefrom, or upon the concentrate or direct reduced ore
produced, or upon the machinery, equipment, tools, supplies and buildings used in such mining,
quarrying or production, or upon the lands occupied by, or used in connection with, such mining,
quarrying or production facilities. If electric or steam power for the mining, transportation or
concentration of such taconite, concentrates or direct reduced ore produced therefrom is generated
in plants principally devoted to the generation of power for such purposes, the plants in which such
power is generated and all machinery, equipment, tools, supplies, transmission and distribution
lines used in the generation and distribution of such power, shall not be considered to be machinery,
equipment, tools, supplies and buildings used in the mining, quarrying, or production of taconite,
taconite concentrates or direct reduced ore within the meaning of this section, and shall be subject
to general property taxation. ­             I­f­

and taxation of the surface of reserve land containing taconite and not occupied by such facilities
or used in connection therewith at the value thereof without regard to the taconite or iron sulphides
therein, nor the assessment and taxation of merchantable iron ore or other minerals, or iron-bearing
materials other than taconite or iron sulphides in such lands in the manner provided by law, nor
the assessment and taxation of facilities used in producing sulphur or sulphur products from iron
sulphide concentrates, or in refining such sulphur products, under the general property tax laws.
Nothing herein shall except from general taxation or from taxation as provided by other laws any
property used for residential or townsite purposes, including utility services thereto. This section
does not provide an exemption from general property taxation for ore docks even if located at the
site of a taconite production facility.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes levied in 2007, payable in 2008, and
thereafter.
      Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 298.28, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. School districts. (a) 17.15 cents per taxable ton, plus the increase provided in paragraph
(d), plus an amount equal to 3 cents per ton of the increased tax proceeds attributable to the increase
in the implicit price deflator as provided in section 298.24, subdivision 1, must be allocated to
qualifying school districts to be distributed, based upon the certification of the commissioner of
revenue, under paragraphs (b) and (c), except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f).
   (b) 3.43 cents per taxable ton must be distributed to the school districts in which the lands from
which taconite was mined or quarried were located or within which the concentrate was produced.
The distribution must be based on the apportionment formula prescribed in subdivision 2.
    (c)(i) ­
           13­­7
              .­2­­16.72 cents per taxable ton, less any amount distributed under paragraph (e), shall
be distributed to a group of school districts comprised of those school districts which qualify as a
tax relief area under section 273.134, paragraph (b), or in which there is a qualifying municipality as
defined by section 273.134, paragraph (a), in direct proportion to school district indexes as follows:
for each school district, its pupil units determined under section 126C.05 for the prior school year
shall be multiplied by the ratio of the average adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit for school
districts receiving aid under this clause as calculated pursuant to chapters 122A, 126C, and 127A
for the school year ending prior to distribution to the adjusted net tax capacity per pupil unit of the
district. Each district shall receive that portion of the distribution which its index bears to the sum
of the indices for all school districts that receive the distributions.
    (ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), each school district that receives a distribution under sections
298.018; 298.23 to 298.28, exclusive of any amount received under this clause; 298.34 to 298.39;
298.391 to 298.396; 298.405; or any law imposing a tax on severed mineral values after reduction
for any portion distributed to cities and towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph
(5), that is less than the amount of its levy reduction under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, for the
second year prior to the year of the distribution shall receive a distribution equal to the difference;
the amount necessary to make this payment shall be derived from proportionate reductions in the

initial distribution to other school districts under clause (i).
    (d) Any school district described in paragraph (c) where a levy increase pursuant to section
126C.17, subdivision 9, was authorized by referendum for taxes payable in 2001, shall receive a
distribution of 21.3 cents per ton. Each district shall receive $175 times the pupil units identified in
section 126C.05, subdivision 1, enrolled in the second previous year or the 1983-1984 school year,
whichever is greater, less the product of 1.8 percent times the district's taxable net tax capacity in
the second previous year.
    If the total amount provided by paragraph (d) is insufficient to make the payments herein required
then the entitlement of $175 per pupil unit shall be reduced uniformly so as not to exceed the
funds available. Any amounts received by a qualifying school district in any fiscal year pursuant
to paragraph (d) shall not be applied to reduce general education aid which the district receives
pursuant to section 126C.13 or the permissible levies of the district. Any amount remaining after
the payments provided in this paragraph shall be paid to the commissioner of Iron Range resources
and rehabilitation who shall deposit the same in the taconite environmental protection fund and the
Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund as provided in subdivision 11.
    Each district receiving money according to this paragraph shall reserve the lesser of the amount
received under this paragraph or $25 times the number of pupil units served in the district. It may
use the money for early childhood programs or for outcome-based learning programs that enhance
the academic quality of the district's curriculum. The outcome-based learning programs must be
approved by the commissioner of education.
    (e) There shall be distributed to any school district the amount which the school district was
entitled to receive under section 298.32 in 1975.
    (f) Effective for the distribution in 2003 only, five percent of the distributions to school districts
under paragraphs (b), (c), and (e); subdivision 6, paragraph (c); subdivision 11; and section 298.225,
shall be distributed to the general fund. The remainder less any portion distributed to cities and
towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph (5), shall be distributed to the Douglas J.
Johnson economic protection trust fund created in section 298.292. Fifty percent of the amount
distributed to the Douglas J. Johnson economic protection trust fund shall be made available for
expenditure under section 298.293 as governed by section 298.296. Effective in 2003 only, 100
percent of the distributions to school districts under section 477A.15 less any portion distributed
to cities and towns under section 126C.48, subdivision 8, paragraph (5), shall be distributed to the
general fund.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for distributions in 2008 and thereafter.

   123B.61 PURCHASE OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT.
    The board of a district may issue general obligation certificates of indebtedness or capital notes
subject to the district debt limits to: (a) purchase vehicles, computers, telephone systems, cable
equipment, photocopy and office equipment, technological equipment for instruction, and other
capital equipment having an expected useful life at least as long as the terms of the certificates
or notes; (b) purchase computer hardware and software, without regard to its expected useful life,
whether bundled with machinery or equipment or unbundled, together with application development
services and training related to the use of the computer; and (c) prepay special assessments. The
certificates or notes must be payable in not more than fi­v
                                                          ­­e ten years and must be issued on the terms
and in the manner determined by the board, except that certificates or notes issued to prepay special
assessments must be payable in not more than 20 years. The certificates or notes may be issued
by resolution and without the requirement for an election. The certificates or notes are general
obligation bonds for purposes of section 126C.55. A tax levy must be made for the payment of
the principal and interest on the certificates or notes, in accordance with section 475.61, as in the
case of bonds. The sum of the tax levies under this section and section 123B.62 for each year must
not exceed the lesser of the amount of the district's total operating capital revenue or the sum of
the district's levy in the general and community service funds excluding the adjustments under this
section for the year preceding the year the initial debt service levies are certified. The district's
general fund levy for each year must be reduced by the sum of (1) the amount of the tax levies
for debt service certified for each year for payment of the principal and interest on the certificates
or notes issued under this section as required by section 475.61, (2) the amount of the tax levies
for debt service certified for each year for payment of the principal and interest on bonds issued
under section 123B.62, and (3) any excess amount in the debt redemption fund used to retire bonds,
certificates, or notes issued under this section or section 123B.62 after April 1, 1997, other than
amounts used to pay capitalized interest. If the district's general fund levy is less than the amount
of the reduction, the balance shall be deducted first from the district's community service fund levy,
and next from the district's general fund or community service fund levies for the following year. A
district using an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the certificates or notes shall
report the amount used for this purpose to the commissioner by July 15 of the following fiscal year.
A district having an outstanding capital loan under section 126C.69 or an outstanding debt service
loan under section 126C.68 must not use an excess amount in the debt redemption fund to retire the
certificates or notes.

the operation of the district including either a property tax levied only on property of the users of
the service within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the
service within the district, or a combination of a property tax and a service charge on the users of

expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations are
payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1,
net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter 429. The town
board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the town to ensure payment
of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service charges are
insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance with chapter
475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not included in
determining the net indebtedness of the town under the provisions of any law limiting indebtedness.

or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the town board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the town as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the town will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations, and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.

territory of the subordinate service district requesting the removal of the district may be presented
to the town board. Within 30 days after the town board receives the petition, the town clerk shall
determine the validity of the signatures on the petition. If the requisite number of signatures are
certified as valid, the town board must hold a public hearing on the petitioned matter. Within 30
days after the end of the hearing, the town board must decide whether to discontinue the subordinate
service district, continue as it is, or take some other action with respect to it.

   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 375B.09, is amended to read:
   375B.09 FINANCING.
    Subdivision 1. Budget. (a) Upon adoption of the next annual budget following the creation of a
subordinate service district the county board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for
the operation of the district including, as appropriate, either a property tax levied only on property
within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the service
within the district, or any combination of a property tax and a service charge.
    (b) A tax or service charge or a combination thereof shall not be imposed to finance a function
or service in the subordinate service district which the county generally provides throughout the
county unless an increase in the level of the service is to be supplied in the subordinate service
district in which case, in addition to the countywide tax levy, only an amount necessary to pay for
the increased level of service may be imposed.
    Subd. 2. Bonds. At any time after the requirements of section 375B.07 have been met and the
subordinate service district created, the county board may issue obligations in an amount it deems
necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making
capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special
services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations
shall be payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed pursuant to
subdivision 1, net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter
429. The county board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the county to
ensure payment of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service
charges are insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance
with chapter 475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not
included in determining the net indebtedness of the county under the provisions of any law limiting
indebtedness.
    Subd. 3. Covenants to secure obligations. In resolutions authorizing the issuance of general
or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net
revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the county board may make covenants for the
protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the county as it deems necessary, including
a covenant that the county will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter
at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments
designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal
and interest when due on the obligations and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments
as may be provided in the resolutions.

    Subd. 4. Continuance in the event of withdrawal. If obligations have been issued for the benefit
of the subordinate service district, and the district is withdrawn or removed pursuant to either section
375B.10 or 375B.11, the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, in the withdrawn or removed district

   Sec. 14. [471.6175] TRUST FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.
    Subdivision 1. Authorization; establishment. A political subdivision or other public entity that
creates or has created an actuarial liability to pay postemployment benefits to employees or officers
after their termination of service may establish a trust to pay those benefits. For purposes of this
section, the term "postemployment benefits" means benefits giving rise to a liability under Statement
No. 45 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and the term "trust" means a trust, a trust
account, or a custodial account or contract authorized under section 401(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
   Subd. 2. Purpose of trust. The trust established under this section may only be used to pay
postemployment benefits and may be either revocable or irrevocable.
   Subd. 3. Trust administrator. The trust administrator of a trust established under this section
shall be either:
   (1) the Public Employees Retirement Association;
   (2) a bank or banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any state
and authorized by the laws under which it is organized to exercise corporate trust powers; or
    (3) an insurance company or agency qualified to do business in Minnesota which has at least
five years' experience in investment products and services for group retirement benefits and which
has a specialized department dedicated to services for retirement investment products.
   A political subdivision or public entity may, in its discretion and in compliance with any
applicable trust document, change trust administrators and transfer trust assets accordingly.
    Subd. 4. Account maintenance. A political subdivision or other public entity may establish
a trust account to be held under the supervision of the trust administrator for the purposes of this
section. A trust administrator shall establish a separate account for each participating political
subdivision or public entity. The trust administrator may charge participating political subdivisions
and public entities fees for reasonable administrative costs. A trust administrator may establish
other reasonable terms and conditions for creation and maintenance of these accounts. The trust
administrator must report to the political subdivision or other public entity on the investment
returns of invested trust assets and on all investment fees or costs incurred by the trust. The
annual rates of return, along with investment and administrative fees and costs for the trust, must
be disclosed in the political subdivision's or public entity's annual financial audit in a manner
prescribed by the state auditor.
    Subd. 5. Investment. (a) The assets of a trust or trust account shall be invested and held as
stipulated in paragraphs (b) to (e).
    (b) The Public Employees Retirement Association must certify all money in the trust accounts
for which it is trust administrator to the State Board of Investment for investment created under
section 11A.14, subject to the policies and procedures established by the State Board of Investment.
Investment earnings must be credited to the trust account of the individual political subdivision or
public entity.
    (c) A trust administrator, other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, must ensure
that all money in the trust accounts for which it is trust administrator is invested by a registered

investment adviser, a bank investment trust department or an insurance company or agency
retirement investment department. Investment earnings must be credited to the trust account of the
individual political subdivision or public entity.
    (d) For trust assets invested by the State Board of Investment, the investment restrictions shall
be the same as those generally applicable to the State Board of Investment. For trust assets invested
by a trust administrator other than the Public Employees Retirement Association, the assets may
only be invested in investments authorized under chapter 118A or section 356A.06, subdivision 7,
in the manner specified in the applicable trust document.
   (e) A political subdivision or public entity may provide investment direction to a trust
administrator in compliance with any applicable trust document.
    Subd. 6. Limit on deposit. A political subdivision or public entity may not deposit money in a
trust or trust account created pursuant to this section if the total amount invested by that political
subdivision or public entity would exceed the political subdivision's or public entity's actuarially
determined liabilities for postemployment benefits due to officers and employees, as determined
under the applicable standards of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.
    Subd. 7. Withdrawal of funds and termination of account. (a) For a revocable account,
a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw some or all of its money or terminate the
trust account. Money and accrued investment earnings withdrawn from a revocable account must
be deposited in a fund separate and distinct from any other funds of the political subdivision
or public entity. This money, with accrued investment earnings, must be used to pay legally
enforceable postemployment benefits to former officers and employees, unless (i) there has been a
change in state or federal law affecting that political subdivision's or public entity's liabilities for
postemployment benefits, or (ii) there has been a change in the demographic composition of that
political subdivision's or public entity's employees eligible for postemployment benefits, or (iii)
there has been a change in the provisions or terms of the postemployment benefits in that political
subdivision or public entity including, but not limited to, the portion of the costs eligible employees
must pay to receive the benefits, or (iv) other factors exist that have a material effect on that political
subdivision's or public entity's actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, in
which event any amount in excess of 100 percent of that political subdivision's or public entity's
actuarially determined liabilities for postemployment benefits, as determined under standards of
the Government Accounting Standards Board, may be withdrawn and used for any purpose.
   (b) For an irrevocable account, a political subdivision or public entity may withdraw money
only:
    (1) as needed to pay postemployment benefits owed to former officers and employees of the
political subdivision or public entity; or
    (2) when all postemployment benefit liability owed to former officers or employees of the
political subdivision or public entity has been satisfied or otherwise defeased.
    (c) A political subdivision or public entity requesting withdrawal of money from an account
created under this section must do so at a time and in the manner required by the executive director
of the Public Employees Retirement Association or specified in an applicable trust document. The
political subdivision or public entity that created the trust must ensure that withdrawals comply with
the requirements of this section.

   (d) The legislature may not divert funds in these trusts or trust accounts for use for another
purpose.
    Subd. 8. Status of irrevocable trust. (a) All money in an irrevocable trust or trust account
created in this section is held in trust for the exclusive benefit of former officers and employees of
the participating political subdivision or public entity, and are not subject to claims by creditors of
the state, the participating political subdivision or public entity, the current or former officers and
employees of the political subdivision or public entity, or the trust administrator.
    (b) An irrevocable trust fund or trust account created in this section shall be deemed an
arrangement equivalent to a trust for all legal purposes.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 15. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 473.39, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 1m. Obligations. After July 1, 2007, in addition to other authority in this section, the

amount of money, which equals or exceeds $25 and which is due and payable to a claimant agency.
The term includes criminal fines imposed under section 609.10 or 609.125, fines imposed for petty
misdemeanors as defined in section 609.02, subdivision 4a, and restitution. The term also includes
the co-payment for the appointment of a district public defender imposed under section 611.17,
paragraph (c). A debt may arise under a contractual or statutory obligation, a court order, or other
legal obligation, but need not have been reduced to judgment.
    A debt includes any legal obligation of a current recipient of assistance which is based
on overpayment of an assistance grant where that payment is based on a client waiver or an
administrative or judicial finding of an intentional program violation; or where the debt is owed to
a program wherein the debtor is not a client at the time notification is provided to initiate recovery
under this chapter and the debtor is not a current recipient of food support, transitional child care,
or transitional medical assistance.
    (b) A debt does not include any legal obligation to pay a claimant agency for medical care,
including hospitalization if the income of the debtor at the time when the medical care was rendered
does not exceed the following amount:
      (1) for an unmarried debtor, an income of $8,800 or less;
      (2) for a debtor with one dependent, an income of $11,270 or less;
      (3) for a debtor with two dependents, an income of $13,330 or less;
      (4) for a debtor with three dependents, an income of $15,120 or less;
      (5) for a debtor with four dependents, an income of $15,950 or less; and
      (6) for a debtor with five or more dependents, an income of $16,630 or less.

   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 289A.60, subdivision 27, is amended to read:
    Subd. 27. Reportable transaction understatement. (a) If a taxpayer has a reportable
transaction understatement for any taxable year, an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of
the reportable transaction understatement must be added to the tax.
   (b)(1) For purposes of this subdivision, "reportable transaction understatement" means the
product of:
    (i) the amount of the increase, if any, in taxable income that results from a difference between
the proper tax treatment of an item to which this section applies and the taxpayer's treatment of that
item as shown on the taxpayer's tax return; and
   (ii) the highest rate of tax imposed on the taxpayer under section 290.06 determined without
regard to the understatement.
    (2) For purposes of clause (1)(i), any reduction of the excess of deductions allowed for the
taxable year over gross income for that year, and any reduction in the amount of capital losses which
would, without regard to section 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code, be allowed for that year, must
be treated as an increase in taxable income.
   (c) This subdivision applies to any item that is attributable to:
   (1) any listed transaction under section 289A.121; and
    (2) any reportable transaction, other than a listed transaction, if a significant purpose of that
transaction is the avoidance or evasion of federal income tax liability.
    (d) Paragraph (a) applies by substituting "30 percent" for "20 percent" with respect to the portion
of any reportable transaction understatement with respect to which the disclosure requirements of
section 289A.121, subdivision 5, and section 6664(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code are not
met.
    (e)(1) No penalty applies under this subdivision with respect to any portion of a reportable
transaction understatement if the taxpayer shows that there was reasonable cause for the portion
and that the taxpayer acted in good faith with respect to the portion. This paragraph applies only if:
   (i) the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of the item are adequately disclosed as required

under section 289A.121;
   (ii) there is or was substantial authority for the treatment; and
    (iii) the taxpayer reasonably believed that the treatment was more likely than not the proper
treatment.
    (2) A taxpayer who did not adequately disclose under section 289A.121 meets the requirements
of clause (1)(i), if the commissioner abates the penalty imposed by subdivision 26, paragraph (d),

    (3) For purposes of clause (1)(iii), a taxpayer is treated as having a reasonable belief with respect
to the tax treatment of an item only if the belief:
     (i) is based on the facts and law that exist when the return of tax which includes the tax treatment
is filed; and
    (ii) relates solely to the taxpayer's chances of success on the merits of the treatment and does not
take into account the possibility that a return will not be audited, the treatment will not be raised on
audit, or the treatment will be resolved through settlement if it is raised.
   (4) An opinion of a tax advisor may not be relied upon to establish the reasonable belief of a
taxpayer if:
   (i) the tax advisor:
    (A) is a material advisor, as defined in section 289A.121, and participates in the organization,
management, promotion, or sale of the transaction or is related (within the meaning of section 267(b)
or 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) to any person who so participates;
   (B) is compensated directly or indirectly by a material advisor with respect to the transaction;
    (C) has a fee arrangement with respect to the transaction which is contingent on all or part of
the intended tax benefits from the transaction being sustained; or
   (D) has a disqualifying financial interest with respect to the transaction, as determined
under United States Treasury regulations prescribed to implement the provisions of section
6664(d)(3)(B)(ii)(IV) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   (ii) the opinion:
   (A) is based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions, including assumptions as to future
events;
    (B) unreasonably relies on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer
or any other person;
   (C) does not identify and consider all relevant facts; or
   (D) fails to meet any other requirement as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe under
federal law.
   (f) The penalty imposed by this subdivision applies in lieu of the penalty imposed under
subdivision 4.

Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the word "1999" shall be substituted for the word
"1992." For 2001, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months
ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2000, and in each subsequent
year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 1999, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the
year preceding the taxable year. The determination of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision
must not be considered a "rule" and is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act contained
in chapter 14. The threshold amount as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest $10 amount. If the
amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10 amount.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2006.

by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B) the word "2005" shall be substituted for the word "1992."
For 2007, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months ending
on August 31, 2005, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2006, and in each subsequent year,
from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2005, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the year
preceding the taxable year. The exemption amount as adjusted must be rounded to the nearest $10.
If the amount ends in $5, it must be rounded up to the nearest $10 amount. The determination of
the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act.

      Sec. 16. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 290.191, subdivision 8, is amended to read:

meanings in this subdivision.
    (b) "Deposit" means the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a financial
institution in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit,
either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account

whether or not advance notice is required to withdraw the credited funds, or which is evidenced by
its certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, or certificate of indebtedness, or
other similar name, or a check or draft drawn against a deposit account and certified by the financial
institution, or a letter of credit or a traveler's check on which the financial institution is primarily
liable. However, without limiting the generality of the term "money or its equivalent," any such
account or instrument must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when
credited or issued in exchange for checks or drafts or for a promissory note upon which the person
obtaining the credit or instrument is primarily or secondarily liable, or for a charge against a deposit
account, or in settlement of checks, drafts, or other instruments forwarded to the bank for collection.
    (c) "Deposit" means trust funds received or held by the financial institution, whether held in the
trust department or held or deposited in any other department of the financial institution.
    (d) "Deposit" means money received or held by a financial institution, or the credit given for
money or its equivalent received or held by a financial institution, in the usual course of business for a
special or specific purpose, regardless of the legal relationship so established. Under this paragraph,
"deposit" includes, but is not limited to, escrow funds, funds held as security for an obligation due to
the financial institution or others, including funds held as dealers reserves, or for securities loaned by
the financial institution, funds deposited by a debtor to meet maturing obligations, funds deposited as
advance payment on subscriptions to United States government securities, funds held for distribution
or purchase of securities, funds held to meet its acceptances or letters of credit, and withheld taxes. It
does not include funds received by the financial institution for immediate application to the reduction
of an indebtedness to the receiving financial institution, or under condition that the receipt of the
funds immediately reduces or extinguishes the indebtedness.
    (e) "Deposit" means outstanding drafts, including advice or another such institution, cashier's
checks, money orders, or other officer's checks issued in the usual course of business for any purpose,
but not including those issued in payment for services, dividends, or purchases or other costs or
expenses of the financial institution itself.
   (f) "Deposit" means money or its equivalent held as a credit balance by a financial institution on
behalf of its customer if the entity is engaged in soliciting and holding such balances in the regular
course of its business.
      (g) Interinstitution fund transfers are not deposits.

either eligible to be deducted for federal income tax purposes or would have been eligible for a bad
debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the taxpayer were required to file a federal income
tax return, or within one year from the date the taxpayer's federal income tax return is timely filed
claiming the bad debt deduction, whichever period is later. The refund or credit is limited to the
amount of overpayment attributable to the loss. "Bad debt" for purposes of this subdivision, has
the same meaning as that term is used in United States Code, title 26, section 166, except that for
a claim relating to an overpayment of taxes under chapter 297A the following are excluded from
the calculation of bad debt: financing charges or interest; sales or use taxes charged on the purchase
price; uncollectible amounts on property that remain in the possession of the seller until the full
purchase price is paid; expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt; and repossessed property.
For purposes of reporting a payment received on previously claimed bad debt under chapter 297A,
any payments made on a debt or account are applied first proportionally to the taxable price of the
property or service and the sales tax on it, and secondly to interest, service charges, and any other
charges.

     (b) Sales price does not include:
    (1) discounts, including cash, terms, or coupons, that are not reimbursed by a third party and
that are allowed by the seller and taken by a purchaser on a sale;
    (2) interest, financing, and carrying charges from credit extended on the sale of personal property
or services, if the amount is separately stated on the invoice, bill of sale, or similar document given
to the purchaser; and
    (3) any taxes legally imposed directly on the consumer that are separately stated on the invoice,
bill of sale, or similar document given to the purchaser.
     (c) Sales price includes consideration received by the seller from third parties if:
   (1) the seller actually receives consideration from a party other than the purchaser and the
consideration is directly related to a price reduction or discount on the sale;
     (2) the seller has an obligation to pass the price reduction or discount through to the purchaser;
    (3) the amount of the consideration attributable to the sale is fixed and determinable by the seller
at the time of the sale of the item to the purchaser; and
     (4) one of the following criteria is met:
    (i) the purchaser presents a coupon, certificate, or other documentation to the seller to claim a
price reduction or discount when the coupon, certificate, or documentation is authorized, distributed,
or granted by a third party with the understanding that the third party will reimburse any seller to
whom the coupon, certificate, or documentation is presented;
    (ii) the purchaser identifies himself or herself to the seller as a member of a group or organization
entitled to a price reduction or discount. A "preferred customer" card that is available to any customer
does not constitute membership in such a group; or
    (iii) the price reduction or discount is identified as a third-party price reduction or discount on
the invoice received by the purchaser or on a coupon, certificate, or other documentation presented
by the purchaser.

paragraph (c), to a hospital are exempt, if the items purchased are used in providing hospital
services. For purposes of this subdivision, "hospital" means a hospital organized and operated
for charitable purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,
and licensed under chapter 144 or by any other jurisdiction, and "hospital services" are services

    (b) Sales, except for those listed in paragraph (c), to an outpatient surgical center are exempt,
if the items purchased are used in providing outpatient surgical services. For purposes of this
subdivision, "outpatient surgical center" means an outpatient surgical center organized and operated
for charitable purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,
and licensed under chapter 144 or by any other jurisdiction. For the purposes of this subdivision,

outpatient surgical center under chapter 144; and (2) urgent care. For purposes of this subdivision,
"urgent care" means health services furnished to a person whose medical condition is sufficiently
acute to require treatment unavailable through, or inappropriate to be provided by, a clinic or
physician's office, but not so acute as to require treatment in a hospital emergency room.
   (c) This exemption does not apply to the following products and services:
    (1) purchases made by a clinic, physician's office, or any other medical facility not operating as
a hospital or outpatient surgical center, even though the clinic, office, or facility may be owned and
operated by a hospital or outpatient surgical center;
   (2) sales under section 297A.61, subdivision 3, paragraph (g), clause (2), and prepared food,
candy, and soft drinks;
   (3) building and construction materials used in constructing buildings or facilities that will not
be used principally by the hospital or outpatient surgical center;
    (4) building, construction, or reconstruction materials purchased by a contractor or a
subcontractor as a part of a lump-sum contract or similar type of contract with a guaranteed
maximum price covering both labor and materials for use in the construction, alteration, or repair
of a hospital or outpatient surgical center; or
   (5) the leasing of a motor vehicle as defined in section 297B.01, subdivision 5.
    (d) A limited liability company also qualifies for exemption under this subdivision if (1) it
consists of a sole member that would qualify for the exemption, and (2) the items purchased qualify
for the exemption.
   (e) An entity that contains both a hospital and a nonprofit unit may claim this exemption on
purchases made for both the hospital and nonprofit unit provided that:
   (1) the nonprofit unit would have qualified for exemption under subdivision 4; and
   (2) the items purchased would have qualified for the exemption.

the taxes payable in the following year.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective beginning January 2, 2007, for taxes payable in
2008 and thereafter.
     Sec. 6. [270.0725] PENALTIES.
    Subdivision 1. Penalty for late filing. If an airline company does not file its annual report by the
date designated in section 270.072, subdivision 3, a penalty of five percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company. On August 1, and on the first day of each succeeding calendar month,
an additional five percent penalty is imposed if the report has not yet been filed. For each airline
company, the penalties imposed under this subdivision for any one year are limited to the lesser of
$25,000 or 25 percent of the assessed tax.
    Subd. 2. Penalty for repeated instances of late filing. If there is a pattern of repeated failures
by an airline company to timely file the report required by this section, a penalty of ten percent of
the tax being assessed is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 3. Penalty for frivolous report. If an airline company files a frivolous annual report, a
penalty of 25 percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company. A frivolous report under
this section is a report that would fulfill the criteria for a frivolous return under section 289A.60,
subdivision 7, notwithstanding the restriction in section 289A.01. In a proceeding involving the
issue of whether or not an airline company is liable for this penalty, the burden of proof is on the
commissioner.
    Subd. 4. Penalty for fraudulent report. If an airline company files a false or fraudulent annual
report with intent to evade or defeat the tax, a penalty equal to 50 percent of the tax being assessed
is imposed on that company.
    Subd. 5. Penalties added to tax. Penalties imposed under this section are added to the tax and
collected as a part of it.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for annual reports due on or after July 1, 2007.

scheduled passenger service to three or more airports inside or outside of this state that serve small or
medium sized communities, shall be assessed at 50 percent of the assessment percentage otherwise
set by paragraph (a).

licensed assessor or other person employed by an assessment jurisdiction or contracting with an
assessment jurisdiction for the purpose of valuing or classifying property for property tax purposes
is prohibited from making appraisals or analyses, accepting an appraisal assignment, or preparing
an appraisal report as defined in section 82B.02, subdivisions 2 to 5, on any property within the
assessment jurisdiction where the individual is employed or performing the duties of the assessor
under contract. Violation of this prohibition shall result in immediate revocation of the individual's
license to assess property for property tax purposes. This prohibition must not be construed to
prohibit an individual from carrying out any duties required for the proper assessment of property
for property tax purposes. If a formal resolution has been adopted by the governing body of a
governmental unit, which specifies the purposes for which such work will be done, this prohibition
does not apply to appraisal activities undertaken on behalf of and at the request of the governmental
unit that has employed or contracted with the individual. The resolution may only allow appraisal
activities which are related to condemnations, right-of-way acquisitions, or special assessments.

                    6­
employer identification number of the grantors and grantees. However, a married person who is
not an owner of record and who is signing a conveyance instrument along with the person's spouse
solely to release and convey their marital interest, if any, in the real property being conveyed is not
a grantor for the purpose of the preceding sentence. A statement in the deed that is substantially in
the following form is sufficient to allow the county auditor to accept a certificate for filing without
the Social Security number of the named spouse: "(Name) claims no ownership interest in the real
property being conveyed and is executing this instrument solely to release and convey a marital
interest, if any, in that real property." The identification numbers of the grantors and grantees are
private data on individuals or nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivisions 9 and 12, but,
notwithstanding that section, the private or nonpublic data may be disclosed to the commissioner of
revenue for purposes of tax administration. The information required to be shown on the certificate
of value is limited to the information required as of the date of the acknowledgment on the deed or
other document to be recorded.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for certificates of value filed on or after July 1,
2007.
    Sec. 25. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.05, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:

assessor system in accordance with section 273.055, the commissioner shall allow the city or town
90 days from the date of incorporation or organization to employ a licensed assessor.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 26. [273.0535] COUNTY OR LOCAL ASSESSING DISTRICT TO ASSUME COST
OF TRAINING.
   The county or local assessing district must assume the cost of training its assessors in courses
approved by the board for the purpose of obtaining the assessor's license to the extent of course fees,
mileage, meals, and lodging, and recognized travel expenses not paid by the state.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
    Sec. 27. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.111, subdivision 3, is amended to read:

    (2) has been in possession of the applicant, the applicant's spouse, parent, or sibling, or any
combination thereof, for a period of at least seven years prior to application for benefits under the
provisions of this section, or is real estate which is farmed with the real estate which qualifies under
this clause and is within four townships or cities or combination thereof from the qualifying real
estate; or
   (3) is the homestead of a shareholder in a family farm corporation as defined in section 500.24,
notwithstanding the fact that legal title to the real estate may be held in the name of the family farm
corporation; or
    (4) is in the possession of a nursery or greenhouse or an entity owned by a proprietor, partnership,
or corporation which also owns the nursery or greenhouse operations on the parcel or parcels.
   (b) Valuation of real estate under this section is limited to parcels the ownership of which is in
noncorporate entities except for:

    273.121 VALUATION OF REAL PROPERTY, NOTICE.
    Any county assessor or city assessor having the powers of a county assessor, valuing or
classifying taxable real property shall in each year notify those persons whose property is to be
included on the assessment roll that year if the person's address is known to the assessor, otherwise
the occupant of the property. The notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by ordinary mail at
least ten days before the meeting of the local board of appeal and equalization under section 274.01
or the review process established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c. Upon written request by
the owner of the property, the assessor may send the notice in electronic form or by electronic
mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail. It shall contain: (1) the market value for the current
and prior assessment, (2) the limited market value under section 273.11, subdivision 1a, for the
current and prior assessment, (3) the qualifying amount of any improvements under section 273.11,
subdivision 16, for the current assessment, (4) the market value subject to taxation after subtracting
the amount of any qualifying improvements for the current assessment, (5) the classification of the
property for the current and prior assessment, (6) a note that if the property is homestead and at
least 45 years old, improvements made to the property may be eligible for a valuation exclusion
under section 273.11, subdivision 16, (7) the assessor's office address, and (8) the dates, places,
and times set for the meetings of the local board of appeal and equalization, the review process
established under section 274.13, subdivision 1c, and the county board of appeal and equalization.
The commissioner of revenue shall specify the form of the notice. The assessor shall attach to the
assessment roll a statement that the notices required by this section have been mailed. Any assessor
who is not provided sufficient funds from the assessor's governing body to provide such notices,
may make application to the commissioner of revenue to finance such notices. The commissioner
of revenue shall conduct an investigation and, if satisfied that the assessor does not have the
necessary funds, issue a certification to the commissioner of finance of the amount necessary to
provide such notices. The commissioner of finance shall issue a warrant for such amount and shall
deduct such amount from any state payment to such county or municipality. The necessary funds
to make such payments are hereby appropriated. Failure to receive the notice shall in no way
affect the validity of the assessment, the resulting tax, the procedures of any board of review or
equalization, or the enforcement of delinquent taxes by statutory means.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for notices required in 2007 and thereafter.
    Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.123, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Reassessment of homestead property. The county assessor shall reassess all
homestead property located within a disaster or emergency area which is physically damaged by
the disaster or emergency and shall adjust the valuation for taxes payable the following year to
reflect the loss in market value caused by the damage as follows: Subtract the market value of the
property as reassessed from the market value of the property as assessed under section 273.01 for

   ­(­) Every property owner applying for homestead classification must furnish to the county
     c­
assessor the Social Security number of each occupant who is listed as an owner of the property
on the deed of record, the name and address of each owner who does not occupy the property,
and the name and Social Security number of each owner's spouse who occupies the property.
The application must be signed by each owner who occupies the property and by each owner's
spouse who occupies the property, or, in the case of property that qualifies as a homestead under
subdivision 1, paragraph (c), by the qualifying relative.
    If a property owner occupies a homestead, the property owner's spouse may not claim another
property as a homestead unless the property owner and the property owner's spouse file with the
assessor an affidavit or other proof required by the assessor stating that the property qualifies as a
homestead under subdivision 1, paragraph (e).
    Owners or spouses occupying residences owned by their spouses and previously occupied with
the other spouse, either of whom fail to include the other spouse's name and Social Security number
on the homestead application or provide the affidavits or other proof requested, will be deemed
to have elected to receive only partial homestead treatment of their residence. The remainder of
the residence will be classified as nonhomestead residential. When an owner or spouse's name and

the appeal is governed by the provisions in chapter 271 which apply to the appeal of a property
tax assessment or levy, but without requiring any prepayment of the amount in controversy. If the
amount of homestead benefits and penalty is not paid within 60 days, and if no appeal has been
filed, the county auditor shall certify the amount of taxes and penalty to the county treasurer. The
county treasurer will add interest to the unpaid homestead benefits and penalty amounts at the rate
provided in section 279.03 for real property taxes becoming delinquent in the calendar year during
which the amount remains unpaid. Interest may be assessed for the period beginning 60 days after
demand for payment was made.
    If the person notified is the current owner of the property, the treasurer may add the total amount
of homestead benefits, penalty, interest, and costs to the ad valorem taxes otherwise payable on the
property by including the amounts on the property tax statements under section 276.04, subdivision
3. The amounts added under this paragraph to the ad valorem taxes shall include interest accrued
through December 31 of the year preceding the taxes payable year for which the amounts are first
added. These amounts, when added to the property tax statement, become subject to all the laws for
the enforcement of real or personal property taxes for that year, and for any subsequent year.
    If the person notified is not the current owner of the property, the treasurer may collect the
amounts due under the Revenue Recapture Act in chapter 270A, or use any of the powers granted
in sections 277.20 and 277.21 without exclusion, to enforce payment of the homestead benefits,
penalty, interest, and costs, as if those amounts were delinquent tax obligations of the person who
owned the property at the time the application related to the improperly allowed homestead was
filed. The treasurer may relieve a prior owner of personal liability for the homestead benefits, penalty,
interest, and costs, and instead extend those amounts on the tax lists against the property as provided
in this paragraph to the extent that the current owner agrees in writing. On all demands, billings,
property tax statements, and related correspondence, the county must list and state separately the
amounts of homestead benefits, penalty, interest and costs being demanded, billed or assessed.
    ­i­ (h) Any amount of homestead benefits recovered by the county from the property owner
    (­)
shall be distributed to the county, city or town, and school district where the property is located
in the same proportion that each taxing district's levy was to the total of the three taxing districts'
levy for the current year. Any amount recovered attributable to taconite homestead credit shall be
transmitted to the St. Louis County auditor to be deposited in the taconite property tax relief account.
Any amount recovered that is attributable to supplemental homestead credit is to be transmitted to
the commissioner of revenue for deposit in the general fund of the state treasury. The total amount
of penalty collected must be deposited in the county general fund.

to furnish lists of all properties and the record owners. The Social Security numbers and
federal identification numbers that are maintained by a county or city assessor for property tax
administration purposes, and that may appear on the lists retain their classification as private or
nonpublic data; but may be viewed, accessed, and used by the county auditor or treasurer of the
same county for the limited purpose of assisting the commissioner in the preparation of microdata
samples under section 270C.12.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 32. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.124, subdivision 14, is amended to read:
    Subd. 14. Agricultural homesteads; special provisions. (a) Real estate of less than ten acres
that is the homestead of its owner must be classified as class 2a under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a), if:
   (1) the parcel on which the house is located is contiguous on at least two sides to (i) agricultural
land, (ii) land owned or administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or (iii) land
administered by the Department of Natural Resources on which in lieu taxes are paid under sections
477A.11 to 477A.14;
   (2) its owner also owns a noncontiguous parcel of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres;
    (3) the noncontiguous land is located not farther than four townships or cities, or a combination
of townships or cities from the homestead; and
   (4) the agricultural use value of the noncontiguous land and farm buildings is equal to at least
50 percent of the market value of the house, garage, and one acre of land.
    Homesteads initially classified as class 2a under the provisions of this paragraph shall remain
classified as class 2a, irrespective of subsequent changes in the use of adjoining properties, as long
as the homestead remains under the same ownership, the owner owns a noncontiguous parcel
of agricultural land that is at least 20 acres, and the agricultural use value qualifies under clause
(4). Homestead classification under this paragraph is limited to property that qualified under this
paragraph for the 1998 assessment.
    (b)(i) Agricultural property consisting of at least 40 acres shall be classified as the owner's
homestead, to the same extent as other agricultural homestead property, if all of the following criteria
are met:
    (1) the owner, the owner's spouse, the son or daughter of the owner or owner's spouse, or the
grandson or granddaughter of the owner or the owner's spouse, is actively farming the agricultural
property, either on the person's own behalf as an individual or on behalf of a partnership operating
a family farm, family farm corporation, joint family farm venture, or limited liability company of
which the person is a partner, shareholder, or member;
    (2) both the owner of the agricultural property and the person who is actively farming the
agricultural property under clause (1), are Minnesota residents;
   (3) neither the owner nor the spouse of the owner claims another agricultural homestead in
Minnesota; ­an
             ­d
              ­
    (4) neither the owner nor the person actively farming the property lives farther than four
townships or cities, or a combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property,
except that if the owner or the owner's spouse is required to live in employer-provided housing,
the owner or owner's spouse, whichever is actively farming the agricultural property, may live
more than four townships or cities, or combination of four townships or cities from the agricultural
property.
        ­; and
   (5) the owner or the person actively farming the property is farming at least 40 acres of the
1748                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [40TH DAY

property.
   The relationship under this paragraph may be either by blood or marriage.
    (ii) Real property held by a trustee under a trust is eligible for agricultural homestead
classification under this paragraph if the qualifications in clause (i) are met, except that "owner"
means the grantor of the trust.
     (iii) Property containing the residence of an owner who owns qualified property under clause
(i) shall be classified as part of the owner's agricultural homestead, if that property is also used for
noncommercial storage or drying of agricultural crops.
    (c) Noncontiguous land shall be included as part of a homestead under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), only if the homestead is classified as class 2a and the detached land
is located in the same township or city, or not farther than four townships or cities or combination
thereof from the homestead. Any taxpayer of these noncontiguous lands must notify the county
assessor that the noncontiguous land is part of the taxpayer's homestead, and, if the homestead is
located in another county, the taxpayer must also notify the assessor of the other county.
    (d) Agricultural land used for purposes of a homestead and actively farmed by a person holding
a vested remainder interest in it must be classified as a homestead under section 273.13, subdivision
23, paragraph (a). If agricultural land is classified class 2a, any other dwellings on the land used for
purposes of a homestead by persons holding vested remainder interests who are actively engaged
in farming the property, and up to one acre of the land surrounding each homestead and reasonably
necessary for the use of the dwelling as a home, must also be assessed class 2a.
   (e) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section 273.13,
subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1997 assessment shall remain classified as agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:
    (1) the property owner abandoned the homestead dwelling located on the agricultural homestead
as a result of the April 1997 floods;
   (2) the property is located in the county of Polk, Clay, Kittson, Marshall, Norman, or Wilkin;
    (3) the agricultural land and buildings remain under the same ownership for the current
assessment year as existed for the 1997 assessment year and continue to be used for agricultural
purposes;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in Minnesota and is within 30 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to the 1997 floods, and
the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in verifying the
change in dwelling. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property continues
to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land remain
uninhabited.
   (f) Agricultural land and buildings that were class 2a homestead property under section
273.13, subdivision 23, paragraph (a), for the 1998 assessment shall remain classified agricultural
homesteads for subsequent assessments if:

assessment year as existed for the 1998 assessment year;
    (4) the dwelling occupied by the owner is located in this state and is within 50 miles of one of
the parcels of agricultural land that is owned by the taxpayer; and
    (5) the owner notifies the county assessor that the relocation was due to a March 29, 1998,
tornado, and the owner furnishes the assessor any information deemed necessary by the assessor in
verifying the change in homestead dwelling. For taxes payable in 1999, the owner must notify the
assessor by December 1, 1998. Further notifications to the assessor are not required if the property
continues to meet all the requirements in this paragraph and any dwellings on the agricultural land
remain uninhabited.
    (g) Agricultural property consisting of at least 40 acres of a family farm corporation, joint
family farm venture, family farm limited liability company, or partnership operating a family
farm as described under subdivision 8 shall be classified homestead, to the same extent as other
agricultural homestead property, if all of the following criteria are met:
   (1) a shareholder, member, or partner of that entity is actively farming the agricultural property;
   (2) that shareholder, member, or partner who is actively farming the agricultural property is a
Minnesota resident;
    (3) neither that shareholder, member, or partner, nor the spouse of that shareholder, member, or
partner claims another agricultural homestead in Minnesota; ­  an
                                                                ­d­
   (4) that shareholder, member, or partner does not live farther than four townships or cities, or a
combination of four townships or cities, from the agricultural property.­; and
    (5) the shareholder, member, or partner actively farming the property is farming at least 40 acres
of the property.
    Homestead treatment applies under this paragraph for property leased to a family farm
corporation, joint farm venture, limited liability company, or partnership operating a family farm if
legal title to the property is in the name of an individual who is a member, shareholder, or partner
in the entity.
    (h) To be eligible for the special agricultural homestead under this subdivision, an initial full
application must be submitted to the county assessor where the property is located. Owners and
the persons who are actively farming the property shall be required to complete only a one-page
abbreviated version of the application in each subsequent year provided that none of the following
items have changed since the initial application:
   (1) the day-to-day operation, administration, and financial risks remain the same;
   (2) the owners and the persons actively farming the property continue to live within the four

changed since the full application was filed, the owner must notify the assessor, and must complete
a new application to determine if the property continues to qualify for the special agricultural
homestead. The commissioner of revenue shall prepare a standard reapplication form for use by
the assessors.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for taxes payable in 2008 and thereafter.

    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment, except that
the requirement that at least 40 acres of the property be farmed by an eligible person is effective for
taxes payable in 2008 and thereafter.
   Sec. 34. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 273.13, subdivision 22, is amended to read:
    Subd. 22. Class 1. (a) Except as provided in subdivision 23 and in paragraphs (b) and (c), real
estate which is residential and used for homestead purposes is class 1a. In the case of a duplex or
triplex in which one of the units is used for homestead purposes, the entire property is deemed to
be used for homestead purposes. The market value of class 1a property must be determined based
upon the value of the house, garage, and land.
   The first $500,000 of market value of class 1a property has a net class rate of one percent of its
market value; and the market value of class 1a property that exceeds $500,000 has a class rate of
1.25 percent of its market value.
    (b) Class 1b property includes homestead real estate or homestead manufactured homes used
for the purposes of a homestead by
   (1) any person who is blind as defined in section 256D.35, or the blind person and the blind
person's spouse; or
   (2) any person, hereinafter referred to as "veteran," who:
   (i) served in the active military or naval service of the United States; and
   (ii) is entitled to compensation under the laws and regulations of the United States for permanent
and total service-connected disability due to the loss, or loss of use, by reason of amputation,
ankylosis, progressive muscular dystrophies, or paralysis, of both lower extremities, such as to
preclude motion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; and
    (iii) has acquired a special housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary
by the nature of the veteran's disability, or the surviving spouse of the deceased veteran for as long
as the surviving spouse retains the special housing unit as a homestead; or
   (3) any person who is permanently and totally disabled.
   Property is classified and assessed under clause (3) only if the government agency or
income-providing source certifies, upon the request of the homestead occupant, that the homestead
occupant satisfies the disability requirements of this paragraph.
    Property is classified and assessed pursuant to clause (1) only if the commissioner of revenue
certifies to the assessor that the homestead occupant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph or
the county assessor has approved the occupant's declaration under section 273.1315.
    Permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of this subdivision means a condition which
is permanent in nature and totally incapacitates the person from working at an occupation which
brings the person an income. The first $32,000 market value of class 1b property has a net class rate
of .45 percent of its market value. The remaining market value of class 1b property has a class rate
using the rates for class 1a or class 2a property, whichever is appropriate, of similar market value.
   (c) Class 1c property is commercial use real and personal property that abuts ­

l­n­­e public water as defined in section 103G.005, subdivision 15, and is devoted to temporary
and seasonal residential occupancy for recreational purposes but not devoted to commercial
purposes for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment, and that includes
a portion used as a homestead by the owner, which includes a dwelling occupied as a homestead
by a shareholder of a corporation that owns the resort, a partner in a partnership that owns the
resort, or a member of a limited liability company that owns the resort even if the title to the
homestead is held by the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. For purposes of
this clause, property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific day if any portion of the
property, excluding the portion used exclusively as a homestead, is used for residential occupancy
and a fee is charged for residential occupancy. Class 1c property is composed of three or more
rental units. A "rental unit" is defined as a cabin, condominium, townhouse, sleeping room, or
individual camping site equipped with water and electrical hookups for recreational vehicles. Class
1c property must provide recreational activities such as the rental of ice fishing houses, boats and
motors, snowmobiles, downhill or cross-country ski equipment; provide marina services, launch
services, or guide services; or sell bait and fishing tackle. Any unit in which the right to use the
property is transferred to an individual or entity by deeded interest, or the sale of shares or stock, no
longer qualifies for class 1c even though it may remain available for rent. A camping pad offered
for rent by a property that otherwise qualifies for class 1c is also class 1c, regardless of the term of
the rental agreement, as long as the use of the camping pad does not exceed 250 days. The portion
of the property used as a homestead is class 1a property under paragraph (a). The remainder of the
property is classified as follows: the first $500,000 of market value is tier I, the next $1,700,000
of market value is tier II, and any remaining market value is tier III. The class rates for class 1c
are: tier I, 0.55 percent; tier II, 1.0 percent; and tier III, 1.25 percent. ­                       I­

held for use by the owner or by the tenants or lessees of the owner as a residence for rental periods
of 30 days or more, excluding property qualifying for class 4d. Class 4a also includes hospitals

property devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreation purposes and
not devoted to commercial purposes for more than 250 days in the year preceding the year of
assessment. For purposes of this clause, property is devoted to a commercial purpose on a specific

as class 4c, seasonal residential recreational for commercial purposes, at least 40 percent of the
annual gross lodging receipts related to the property must be from business conducted during 90
consecutive days and either (i) at least 60 percent of all paid bookings by lodging guests during the
year must be for periods of at least two consecutive nights; or (ii) at least 20 percent of the annual
gross receipts must be from charges for rental of fish houses, boats and motors, snowmobiles,
downhill or cross-country ski equipment, or charges for marina services, launch services, and guide
services, or the sale of bait and fishing tackle. For purposes of this determination, a paid booking
of five or more nights shall be counted as two bookings. Class 4c also includes commercial use
real property used exclusively for recreational purposes in conjunction with class 4c property
devoted to temporary and seasonal residential occupancy for recreational purposes, up to a total
of two acres, provided the property is not devoted to commercial recreational use for more than
250 days in the year preceding the year of assessment and is located within two miles of the class
4c property with which it is used. Owners of real and personal property devoted to temporary and

   A structure used as a clubhouse, restaurant, or place of refreshment in conjunction with the golf
course is classified as class 3a property;
    (3) real property up to a maximum of one acre of land owned by a nonprofit community service
oriented organization; provided that the property is not used for a revenue-producing activity for

used for residential purposes on either a temporary or permanent basis. For purposes of this clause,
a "nonprofit community service oriented organization" means any corporation, society, association,
foundation, or institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, fraternal,
civic, or educational purposes, and which is exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to section
501(c)(3), (10), or (19) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended through December 31,

sale;
   (8) a privately owned noncommercial aircraft storage hangar not exempt under section 272.01,
subdivision 2, and the land on which it is located, provided that:

    (ii) the owner of the aircraft storage hangar provides the assessor with a signed agreement
restricting the use of the premises, prohibiting commercial use or activity performed at the hangar;
and
    (9) residential real estate, a portion of which is used by the owner for homestead purposes, and
that is also a place of lodging, if all of the following criteria are met:
   (i) rooms are provided for rent to transient guests that generally stay for periods of 14 or fewer
days;
   (ii) meals are provided to persons who rent rooms, the cost of which is incorporated in the basic

days in the calendar year preceding the year of the assessment; and
   (iv) the owner is the operator of the property.
The market value subject to the 4c classification under this clause is limited to five rental units. Any
rental units on the property in excess of five, must be valued and assessed as class 3a. The portion of
the property used for purposes of a homestead by the owner must be classified as class 1a property
under subdivision 22.
    Class 4c property has a class rate of 1.5 percent of market value, except that (i) each parcel of
seasonal residential recreational property not used for commercial purposes has the same class rates
as class 4bb property, (ii) manufactured home parks assessed under clause (5) have the same class
rate as class 4b property, (iii) commercial-use seasonal residential recreational property has a class

    (e) Class 4d property is qualifying low-income rental housing certified to the assessor by the
Housing Finance Agency under section 273.128, subdivision 3. If only a portion of the units in the
building qualify as low-income rental housing units as certified under section 273.128, subdivision
3, only the proportion of qualifying units to the total number of units in the building qualify for class
4d. The remaining portion of the building shall be classified by the assessor based upon its use. Class
4d also includes the same proportion of land as the qualifying low-income rental housing units are to
the total units in the building. For all properties qualifying as class 4d, the market value determined
by the assessor must be based on the normal approach to value using normal unrestricted rents.
   Class 4d property has a class rate of 0.75 percent.

of greater than 5,000 and less than 75,000 according to the 1980 decennial census.
   (b) The credit is an amount sufficient to reduce (i) the taxes levied on class 4a property to 2.3
percent of the property's market value and (ii) the tax on class 3a and class 3b property to 2.3 percent
of market value.
    (c) The county auditor shall annually certify the costs of the credits to the Department of
Revenue. The department shall reimburse local governments for the property taxes foregone as the
result of the credits in proportion to their total levies.

the pipeline system of mains, pipes, and equipment attached thereto, of pipeline companies and
others engaged in the operations or business of transporting natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, or
other petroleum products by pipelines, shall be listed with and assessed by the commissioner of
revenue and the values provided to the city or county assessor by order. This subdivision shall not
apply to the assessment of the products transported through the pipelines nor to the lines of local
commercial gas companies engaged primarily in the business of distributing gas to consumers at
retail nor to pipelines used by the owner thereof to supply natural gas or other petroleum products
exclusively for such owner's own consumption and not for resale to others. If more than 85 percent
of the natural gas or other petroleum products actually transported over the pipeline is used for
the owner's own consumption and not for resale to others, then this subdivision shall not apply;
provided, however, that in that event, the pipeline shall be assessed in proportion to the percentage
of gas actually transported over such pipeline that is not used for the owner's own consumption.
On or before June 30, the commissioner shall certify to the auditor of each county, the amount of
such personal property assessment against each company in each district in which such property is

   Sec. 40. [273.3711] RECOMMENDED AND ORDERED VALUES.
   For purposes of sections 273.33, 273.35, 273.36, 273.37, 273.371, and 273.372, all values not

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 41. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.01, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Ordinary board; meetings, deadlines, grievances. (a) The town board of a
town, or the council or other governing body of a city, is the board of appeal and equalization except
(1) in cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization or (2) in any city or town that has
transferred its local board of review power and duties to the county board as provided in subdivision
3. The county assessor shall fix a day and time when the board or the board of equalization shall meet
in the assessment districts of the county. Notwithstanding any law or city charter to the contrary, a
city board of equalization shall be referred to as a board of appeal and equalization. On or before
February 15 of each year the assessor shall give written notice of the time to the city or town clerk.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any charter to the contrary, the meetings must be held between
April 1 and May 31 each year. The clerk shall give published and posted notice of the meeting at
least ten days before the date of the meeting.
    The board shall meet at the office of the clerk to review the assessment and classification of
property in the town or city. No changes in valuation or classification which are intended to correct
errors in judgment by the county assessor may be made by the county assessor after the board
has adjourned in those cities or towns that hold a local board of review; however, corrections of
errors that are merely clerical in nature or changes that extend homestead treatment to property are
permitted after adjournment until the tax extension date for that assessment year. The changes must
be fully documented and maintained in the assessor's office and must be available for review by
any person. A copy of the changes made during this period in those cities or towns that hold a local
board of review must be sent to the county board no later than December 31 of the assessment year.
    (b) The board shall determine whether the taxable property in the town or city has been properly
placed on the list and properly valued by the assessor. If real or personal property has been omitted,
the board shall place it on the list with its market value, and correct the assessment so that each
tract or lot of real property, and each article, parcel, or class of personal property, is entered on the
assessment list at its market value. No assessment of the property of any person may be raised unless
the person has been duly notified of the intent of the board to do so. On application of any person
40TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007                                        1759

feeling aggrieved, the board shall review the assessment or classification, or both, and correct it as
appears just. The board may not make an individual market value adjustment or classification change
that would benefit the property if the owner or other person having control over the property has
refused the assessor access to inspect the property and the interior of any buildings or structures as
provided in section 273.20. A board member shall not participate in any actions of the board which
result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by the board member,
the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt,
nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has a financial interest.
The relationship may be by blood or marriage.
     (c) A local board may reduce assessments upon petition of the taxpayer but the total reductions
must not reduce the aggregate assessment made by the county assessor by more than one percent.
If the total reductions would lower the aggregate assessments made by the county assessor by more
than one percent, none of the adjustments may be made. The assessor shall correct any clerical errors
or double assessments discovered by the board without regard to the one percent limitation.
   (d) A local board does not have authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.
    (e) A majority of the members may act at the meeting, and adjourn from day to day until they
finish hearing the cases presented. The assessor shall attend, with the assessment books and papers,
and take part in the proceedings, but must not vote. The county assessor, or an assistant delegated
by the county assessor shall attend the meetings. The board shall list separately, on a form appended
to the assessment book, all omitted property added to the list by the board and all items of property
increased or decreased, with the market value of each item of property, added or changed by the
board, placed opposite the item. The county assessor shall enter all changes made by the board in
the assessment book.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 3, if a person fails to appear in person, by counsel, or by
written communication before the board after being duly notified of the board's intent to raise the
assessment of the property, or if a person feeling aggrieved by an assessment or classification fails to
apply for a review of the assessment or classification, the person may not appear before the county
board of appeal and equalization for a review of the assessment or classification. This paragraph
does not apply if an assessment was made after the local board meeting, as provided in section
273.01, or if the person can establish not having received notice of market value at least five days
before the local board meeting.
    (g) The local board must complete its work and adjourn within 20 days from the time of
convening stated in the notice of the clerk, unless a longer period is approved by the commissioner
of revenue. No action taken after that date is valid. All complaints about an assessment or
classification made after the meeting of the board must be heard and determined by the county
board of equalization. A nonresident may, at any time, before the meeting of the board file written
objections to an assessment or classification with the county assessor. The objections must be
presented to the board at its meeting by the county assessor for its consideration.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 42. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 274.13, subdivision 1, is amended to read:

commissioners, or a majority of them, with the county auditor, or, if the auditor cannot be present,
the deputy county auditor, or, if there is no deputy, the court administrator of the district court,
shall form a board for the equalization of the assessment of the property of the county, including
the property of all cities whose charters provide for a board of equalization. This board shall be
referred to as the county board of appeal and equalization. The board shall meet annually, on the
date specified in section 274.14, at the office of the auditor. Each member shall take an oath to
fairly and impartially perform duties as a member. Members shall not participate in any actions of
the board which result in market value adjustments or classification changes to property owned by
the board member, the spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, grandparent, grandchild, brother,
sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece of a board member, or property in which a board member has
a financial interest. The relationship may be by blood or marriage. The board shall examine and
compare the returns of the assessment of property of the towns or districts, and equalize them so
that each tract or lot of real property and each article or class of personal property is entered on the
assessment list at its market value, subject to the following rules:
    (1) The board shall raise the valuation of each tract or lot of real property which in its opinion is
returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. The board must first give
notice of intention to raise the valuation to the person in whose name it is assessed, if the person is
a resident of the county. The notice must fix a time and place for a hearing.
    (2) The board shall reduce the valuation of each tract or lot which in its opinion is returned above
its market value to the sum believed to be its market value.
    (3) The board shall raise the valuation of each class of personal property which in its opinion
is returned below its market value to the sum believed to be its market value. It shall raise the
aggregate value of the personal property of individuals, firms, or corporations, when it believes that
the aggregate valuation, as returned, is less than the market value of the taxable personal property
possessed by the individuals, firms, or corporations, to the sum it believes to be the market value.
The board must first give notice to the persons of intention to do so. The notice must set a time and
place for a hearing.
    (4) The board shall reduce the valuation of each class of personal property that is returned above
its market value to the sum it believes to be its market value. Upon complaint of a party aggrieved,
the board shall reduce the aggregate valuation of the individual's personal property, or of any class
of personal property for which the individual is assessed, which in its opinion has been assessed at
too large a sum, to the sum it believes was the market value of the individual's personal property of
that class.
    (5) The board must not reduce the aggregate value of all the property of its county, as submitted
to the county board of equalization, with the additions made by the auditor under this chapter, by
more than one percent of its whole valuation. The board may raise the aggregate valuation of real
property, and of each class of personal property, of the county, or of any town or district of the
county, when it believes it is below the market value of the property, or class of property, to the
aggregate amount it believes to be its market value.
    (6) The board shall change the classification of any property which in its opinion is not properly
classified.
   (7) The board does not have the authority to grant an exemption or to order property removed
from the tax rolls.

   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
  Sec. 43. [274.135] COUNTY BOARDS; APPEALS AND EQUALIZATION COURSE
AND MEETING REQUIREMENTS.
    Subdivision 1. Handbook for county boards. By no later than January 1, 2009, the
commissioner of revenue must develop a handbook detailing procedures, responsibilities, and
requirements for county boards of appeal and equalization. The handbook must include, but need
not be limited to, the role of the county board in the assessment process, the legal and policy
reasons for fair and impartial appeal and equalization hearings, county board meeting procedures
that foster fair and impartial assessment reviews and other best practices recommendations, quorum
requirements for county boards, and explanations of alternate methods of appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeals and equalization course. Beginning in 2009, and each year thereafter, there
must be at least one member at each meeting of a county board of appeal and equalization who has
attended an appeals and equalization course developed or approved by the commissioner within the
last four years, as certified by the commissioner. The course may be offered in conjunction with a
meeting of the Minnesota Association of Assessment Officers. The course content must include, but
need not be limited to, a review of the handbook developed by the commissioner under subdivision
1.
    Subd. 3. Proof of compliance; transfer of duties. (a) Any county that conducts county boards
of appeal and equalization meetings must provide proof to the commissioner by December 1, 2009,
and each year thereafter, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subdivision 2. Beginning
in 2009, this notice must also verify that there was a quorum of voting members at each meeting
of the board of appeal and equalization in the current year. A county that does not comply with
these requirements is deemed to have transferred its board of appeal and equalization powers to the
special board of equalization appointed pursuant to section 274.13, subdivision 2, beginning with
the following year's assessment and continuing unless the powers are reinstated under paragraph
(c). A county that does not comply with the requirements of subdivision 2 and has not appointed
a special board of equalization shall appoint a special board of equalization before the following
year's assessment.
    (b) The county shall notify the taxpayers when the board of appeal and equalization for a county
has been transferred to the special board of equalization under this subdivision and, prior to the
meeting time of the special board of equalization, the county shall make available to those taxpayers
a procedure for a review of the assessments, including, but not limited to, open book meetings. This
alternate review process must take place in April and May.
    (c) A county board whose powers are transferred to the special board of equalization under this
subdivision may be reinstated by resolution of the county board and upon proof of compliance with
the requirements of subdivision 2. The resolution and proofs must be provided to the commissioner
by December 1 in order to be effective for the following year's assessment.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.
   Sec. 44. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 275.065, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Notice of proposed property taxes. (a) The county auditor shall prepare and the county
treasurer shall deliver after November 10 and on or before November 24 each year, by first class
1762                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [40TH DAY

mail to each taxpayer at the address listed on the county's current year's assessment roll, a notice of
proposed property taxes. Upon written request by the taxpayer, the treasurer may send the notice in
electronic form or by electronic mail instead of on paper or by ordinary mail.
   (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of the notice.
    (c) The notice must inform taxpayers that it contains the amount of property taxes each taxing
authority proposes to collect for taxes payable the following year. In the case of a town, or in the
case of the state general tax, the final tax amount will be its proposed tax. In the case of taxing
authorities required to hold a public meeting under subdivision 6, the notice must clearly state that
each taxing authority, including regional library districts established under section 134.201, and
including the metropolitan taxing districts as defined in paragraph (i), but excluding all other special
taxing districts and towns, will hold a public meeting to receive public testimony on the proposed
budget and proposed or final property tax levy, or, in case of a school district, on the current budget
and proposed property tax levy. It must clearly state the time and place of each taxing authority's
meeting, a telephone number for the taxing authority that taxpayers may call if they have questions
related to the notice, and an address where comments will be received by mail.
   (d) The notice must state for each parcel:
    (1) the market value of the property as determined under section 273.11, and used for computing
property taxes payable in the following year and for taxes payable in the current year as each appears
in the records of the county assessor on November 1 of the current year; and, in the case of residential
property, whether the property is classified as homestead or nonhomestead. The notice must clearly
inform taxpayers of the years to which the market values apply and that the values are final values;
    (2) the items listed below, shown separately by county, city or town, and state general tax, net
of the residential and agricultural homestead credit under section 273.1384, voter approved school
levy, other local school levy, and the sum of the special taxing districts, and as a total of all taxing
authorities:
   (i) the actual tax for taxes payable in the current year; and
   (ii) the proposed tax amount.
    If the county levy under clause (2) includes an amount for a lake improvement district as defined
under sections 103B.501 to 103B.581, the amount attributable for that purpose must be separately
stated from the remaining county levy amount.
    In the case of a town or the state general tax, the final tax shall also be its proposed tax unless
the town changes its levy at a special town meeting under section 365.52. If a school district has
certified under section 126C.17, subdivision 9, that a referendum will be held in the school district at
the November general election, the county auditor must note next to the school district's proposed
amount that a referendum is pending and that, if approved by the voters, the tax amount may be
higher than shown on the notice. In the case of the city of Minneapolis, the levy for the Minneapolis
Library Board and the levy for Minneapolis Park and Recreation shall be listed separately from
the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the case of the city of St. Paul, the levy for the St.
Paul Library Agency must be listed separately from the remaining amount of the city's levy. In the
case of Ramsey County, any amount levied under section 134.07 may be listed separately from the
remaining amount of the county's levy. In the case of a parcel where tax increment or the fiscal

disparities areawide tax under chapter 276A or 473F applies, the proposed tax levy on the captured
value or the proposed tax levy on the tax capacity subject to the areawide tax must each be stated
separately and not included in the sum of the special taxing districts; and
   (3) the increase or decrease between the total taxes payable in the current year and the total
proposed taxes, expressed as a percentage.
    For purposes of this section, the amount of the tax on homesteads qualifying under the senior
citizens' property tax deferral program under chapter 290B is the total amount of property tax before
subtraction of the deferred property tax amount.
   (e) The notice must clearly state that the proposed or final taxes do not include the following:
   (1) special assessments;
    (2) levies approved by the voters after the date the proposed taxes are certified, including bond
referenda and school district levy referenda;
  (3) a levy limit increase approved by the voters by the first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November of the levy year as provided under section 275.73;
    (4) amounts necessary to pay cleanup or other costs due to a natural disaster occurring after the
date the proposed taxes are certified;
    (5) amounts necessary to pay tort judgments against the taxing authority that become final after
the date the proposed taxes are certified; and
   (6) the contamination tax imposed on properties which received market value reductions for
contamination.
    (f) Except as provided in subdivision 7, failure of the county auditor to prepare or the county
treasurer to deliver the notice as required in this section does not invalidate the proposed or final tax
levy or the taxes payable pursuant to the tax levy.
    (g) If the notice the taxpayer receives under this section lists the property as nonhomestead,
and satisfactory documentation is provided to the county assessor by the applicable deadline, and
the property qualifies for the homestead classification in that assessment year, the assessor shall
reclassify the property to homestead for taxes payable in the following year.
   (h) In the case of class 4 residential property used as a residence for lease or rental periods of 30
days or more, the taxpayer must either:
    (1) mail or deliver a copy of the notice of proposed property taxes to each tenant, renter, or
lessee; or
   (2) post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises of the property.
    The notice must be mailed or posted by the taxpayer by November 27 or within three days of
receipt of the notice, whichever is later. A taxpayer may notify the county treasurer of the address
of the taxpayer, agent, caretaker, or manager of the premises to which the notice must be mailed in
order to fulfill the requirements of this paragraph.

included with the appropriate county's levy and shall be discussed at that county's public hearing.
    (j) The governing body of a county, city, or school district may, with the consent of the county
board, include supplemental information with the statement of proposed property taxes about
the impact of state aid increases or decreases on property tax increases or decreases and on the
level of services provided in the affected jurisdiction. This supplemental information may include
information for the following year, the current year, and for as many consecutive preceding years
as deemed appropriate by the governing body of the county, city, or school district. It may include
only information regarding:
   (1) the impact of inflation as measured by the implicit price deflator for state and local
government purchases;

      Sec. 55. [290C.13] APPEALS.
     Subdivision 1. Claimant right to reconsideration. A claimant may obtain reconsideration by
the commissioner of a determination removing enrolled land from the sustainable forest incentive
program, a determination denying an application to enroll land in the program, or a denial of part or
all of an incentive payment by filing an administrative appeal under subdivision 4. A claimant cannot
obtain reconsideration under this section if the action taken by the commissioner is the outcome of
an administrative appeal.
    Subd. 2. Appeal by claimant. A claimant who wishes to seek administrative review must follow
the procedures in subdivision 4.
    Subd. 3. Notice date. For purposes of this section, the term "notice date" means the date of the
determination removing enrolled land or the date of the notice denying an application to enroll land
or denying part or all of an incentive payment.
    Subd. 4. Time and content for administrative appeal. Within 60 days after the notice date, the
claimant must file a written appeal with the commissioner. The appeal need not be in any particular
form but must contain the following information:
      (1) name and address of the claimant;
    (2) if a corporation, the state of incorporation of the claimant, and the principal place of business
of the corporation;
    (3) the Minnesota or federal business identification number or Social Security number of the
claimant;
      (4) the date;
      (5) the periods involved and the amount of payment involved for each year or period;

   Subd. 5. Extensions. When requested in writing and within the time allowed for filing an
administrative appeal, the commissioner may extend the time for filing an appeal for a period not
more than 30 days from the expiration of the 60 days from the notice date.
    Subd. 6. Determination of appeal. On the basis of applicable law and available information,
the commissioner shall determine the validity, if any, in whole or in part, of the appeal and notify the
claimant of the decision. This notice must be in writing and contain the basis for the determination.
    Subd. 7. Agreement determining issues under appeal. When it appears to be in the best
interests of the state, the commissioner may settle the amount of any incentive payments,
payments owed by the claimant under section 290C.11, paragraph (b), penalties, or interest that
the commissioner has under consideration by virtue of an appeal filed under this section. An
agreement must be in writing and signed by the commissioner and the claimant, or the claimant's
representative authorized by the claimant to enter into an agreement. The agreement is final and
conclusive and, except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material
fact, the case must not be reopened as to the matters agreed upon.
     Subd. 8. Appeal to Tax Court. Within 60 days after the commissioner denies an appeal, or
within 120 days after the commissioner received a written appeal if the commissioner has not made
a determination in that time, the claimant may appeal to Tax Court under chapter 271 as if the appeal
is from an order of the commissioner.
      Subd. 9. Exemption from Administrative Procedure Act. This section is not subject to chapter
14.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

of the supplemental benefits paid to qualified recipients.
    (b) The commissioner of revenue shall prescribe the form of and supporting information that
must be supplied as part of the application for state reimbursement. The commissioner of revenue
shall reimburse the relief association by paying the reimbursement amount to the treasurer of the
municipality where the association is located. Within 30 days after receipt, the municipal treasurer
shall transmit the state reimbursement to the treasurer of the association if the association has filed
a financial report with the municipality. If the relief association has not filed a financial report with
the municipality, the municipal treasurer shall delay transmission of the reimbursement payment to
the association until the complete financial report is filed. If the association has dissolved or has
been removed as a trustee of state aid, the treasurer shall deposit the money in a special account in
the municipal treasury, and the money may be disbursed only for the purposes and in the manner
provided in section 424A.08. When paid to the association,
    ­
    (­
     c­
      ) the reimbursement payment must be deposited in the special fund of the relief association.

    ­­) (c) A sum sufficient to make the payments is appropriated from the general fund to the
commissioner of revenue.

impact. The political subdivision, its representative association, or commissioner shall convey the
requested information to the commissioner of finance with a signed statement to the effect that
the information is accurate and complete to the best of its ability. The political subdivision, its
representative association, or commissioner, when requested, shall update its determination of local
fiscal impact based on actual cost or revenue figures, improved estimates, or both. Upon completion
of the note, the commissioner must provide a copy to the authors of the proposed legislation­                              ­o

allocate money to the following accounts and purposes in priority order:
    (1) the cash flow account established in subdivision 1 until that account reaches $350,000,000;
   (2) the budget reserve account established in subdivision 1a until that account reaches
$653,000,000;
    (3) the amount necessary to increase the aid payment schedule for school district aids and credits
payments in section 127A.45 to not more than 90 percent rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent
without exceeding the amount available and with any remaining funds deposited in the budget
reserve; and
    (4) the amount necessary to restore all or a portion of the net aid reductions under section
127A.441 and to reduce the property tax revenue recognition shift under section 123B.75,
subdivision 5, paragraph (c), and Laws 2003, First Special Session chapter 9, article 5, section 34,
as amended by Laws 2003, First Special Session chapter 23, section 20, by the same amount.
    (b) The amounts necessary to meet the requirements of this section are appropriated from
the general fund within two weeks after the forecast is released or, in the case of transfers under
paragraph (a), clauses (3) and (4), as necessary to meet the appropriations schedules otherwise
established in statute.

is not a collection agency as defined by section 332.31, subdivision 3, and is not licensed, bonded,
or regulated by the commissioner of commerce under sections 332.31 to 332.35 or 332.38 to
332.45. The commissioner is subject to section 332.37, except clause (9), (10), (12), or (19). Debts
referred to the commissioner for collection under section 256.9792 may in turn be referred by the
commissioner to the enterprise. An audited financial statement may not be required as a condition
of debt placement with a private agency if the private agency: (1) has errors and omissions coverage
under a professional liability policy in an amount of at least $1,000,000; or (2) has a fidelity bond to
cover actions of its employees, in an amount of at least $100,000. In cases of debts referred under
section 256.9792, the provisions of this chapter and section 256.9792 apply to the extent they are
not in conflict. If they are in conflict, the provisions of section 256.9792 control. For purposes of
this chapter, the referring agency for such debts remains the Department of Human Services.

change a rate which has been duly established under this chapter, except upon 60 days' notice
to the commission. The notice shall include statements of facts, expert opinions, substantiating
documents, and exhibits, supporting the change requested, and state the change proposed to be
made in the rates then in force and the time when the modified rates will go into effect. If the
filing utility does not have an approved energy conservation improvement plan on file with the
department, it shall also include in its notice an energy conservation plan pursuant to section
216B.241. A filing utility subject to rate regulation under section 216B.026 shall reference in its
notice the energy conservation improvement plans of the generation and transmission cooperative
providing energy conservation improvement programs to members of the filing utility pursuant to
section 216B.241. The filing utility shall give written notice, as approved by the commission, of
the proposed change to the governing body of each municipality and county in the area affected.
All proposed changes shall be shown by filing new schedules or shall be plainly indicated upon
schedules on file and in force at the time.

COSTS.
   Subdivision 1. Definitions. (a) "Electric utility" means a public utility as defined in section
216B.02, subdivision 4, that furnishes electric service to retail customers.
   (b) "Electric utility infrastructure costs" or "EUIC" means costs for electric utility infrastructure
projects that were not included in the electric utility's rate base in its most recent general rate case.
   (c) "Electric utility infrastructure projects" means projects that:
    (1) replace or modify existing electric utility infrastructure, including utility-owned buildings,
if the replacement or modification is shown to conserve energy or use energy more efficiently,
consistent with section 216B.241, subdivision 1c; or
    (2) conserve energy or use energy more efficiently by using waste heat recovery converted into
electricity as defined in section 216B.241, subdivision 1, paragraph (n).
    Subd. 2. Filing. (a) The commission may approve an electric utility's petition for a rate schedule
to recover EUIC under this section. An electric utility may petition the commission to recover a rate
of return, income taxes on the rate of return, incremental property taxes, if any, plus incremental
depreciation expense associated with EUIC.
   (b) The filing is subject to the following:
   (1) an electric utility may submit a filing under this section no more than once per year; and
   (2) an electric utility must file sufficient information to satisfy the commission regarding the
proposed EUIC or be subject to denial by the commission. The information includes, but is not
limited to:
   (i) the location, description, and costs associated with the project;
   (ii) evidence that the electric utility infrastructure project will conserve energy or use energy
more efficiently than similar utility facilities currently used by the electric utility;
   (iii) the proposed schedule for implementation;
    (iv) a description of the costs, and salvage value, if any, associated with the existing infrastructure
replaced or modified as a result of the project;
   (v) the proposed rate design and an explanation of why the proposed rate design is in the public

interest;
   (vi) the magnitude of timing of any known future electric utility projects that the utility may
seek to recover under this section;
   (vii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's base revenue as approved by the
commission in the electric utility's most recent general rate case, exclusive of fuel cost adjustments;
    (viii) the magnitude of EUIC in relation to the electric utility's capital expenditures since its most
recent general rate case;
   (ix) the amount of time since the utility last filed a general rate case and the utility's reasons for
seeking recovery outside of a general rate case;
    (x) documentation supporting the calculation of the EUIC; and
   (xi) a cost and benefit analysis showing that the electric utility infrastructure project is in the
public interest.
Upon approval of the proposed projects and associated EUIC rate schedule, the utility may
implement the electric utility infrastructure projects.
   Subd. 3. Commission authority; orders. The commission may issue orders necessary to
implement and administer this section.
    Sec. 4. [216B.2401] ENERGY CONSERVATION POLICY GOAL.
    It is the energy policy of the state of Minnesota to achieve annual energy savings equal to
1.5 percent of annual retail energy sales of electricity and natural gas directly through energy
conservation improvement programs and rate design, and indirectly through energy codes and
appliance standards, programs designed to transform the market or change consumer behavior,
energy savings resulting from efficiency improvements to the utility infrastructure and system, and
other efforts to promote energy efficiency and energy conservation.
    Sec. 5. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 216B.241, is amended to read:
    216B.241 ENERGY CONSERVATION IMPROVEMENT.

   (1) for a utility that furnishes gas service, 0.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from service
provided in the state;
    (2) for a utility that furnishes electric service, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from
service provided in the state; and
    (3) for a utility that furnishes electric service and that operates a nuclear-powered electric
generating plant within the state, two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided
in the state.
    For purposes of this paragraph (a), "gross operating revenues" do not include revenues from
large electric customer facilities exempted by the commissioner under paragraph (b).
      (b) The owner of a large electric customer facility may petition the commissioner to exempt
both electric and gas utilities serving the large energy customer facility from the investment and
expenditure requirements of paragraph (a) with respect to retail revenues attributable to the facility.
At a minimum, the petition must be supported by evidence relating to competitive or economic
pressures on the customer and a showing by the customer of reasonable efforts to identify, evaluate,
and implement cost-effective conservation improvements at the facility. If a petition is filed on or
before October 1 of any year, the order of the commissioner to exempt revenues attributable to the
facility can be effective no earlier than January 1 of the following year. The commissioner shall
not grant an exemption if the commissioner determines that granting the exemption is contrary
to the public interest. The commissioner may, after investigation, rescind any exemption granted
under this paragraph upon a determination that ­                           co

under this paragraph, the owner of any large electric customer facility shall, upon request, provide
the commissioner with updated information comparable to that originally supplied in or with the
owner's original petition under this paragraph.
   (c) The commissioner may require investments or spending greater than the amounts required
under this subdivision for a public utility whose most recent advance forecast required under section
216B.2422 or 216C.17 projects a peak demand deficit of 100 megawatts or greater within five years
under midrange forecast assumptions.
     (d) A public utility or owner of a large electric customer facility may appeal a decision of the
commissioner under paragraph (b) or (c) to the commission under subdivision 2. In reviewing a
decision of the commissioner under paragraph (b) or (c), the commission shall rescind the decision
if it finds that the required investments or spending will:
     (1) not result in cost-effective energy conservation improvements; or
     (2) otherwise not be in the public interest.

   (b) Each cooperative electric association and municipality subject to this subdivision shall spend
and invest for energy conservation improvements under this subdivision the following amounts:
    (1) for a municipality, 0.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from the sale of gas and
1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from the sale of electricity, excluding gross operating
revenues from electric and gas service provided in the state to large electric customer facilities; and
    (2) for a cooperative electric association, 1.5 percent of its gross operating revenues from service
provided in the state, excluding gross operating revenues from service provided in the state to large
electric customer facilities indirectly through a distribution cooperative electric association.
    (c) Each municipality and cooperative electric association subject to this subdivision shall
identify and implement energy conservation improvement spending and investments that are
appropriate for the municipality or association, except that a municipality or association may not
spend or invest for energy conservation improvements that directly benefit a large energy facility
or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has issued an exemption under
subdivision 1a, paragraph (b).
    (d) Each municipality and cooperative electric association subject to this subdivision may spend
and invest annually up to ten percent of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy
conservation improvements under this subdivision on research and development projects that meet
the definition of energy conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by
the municipality or cooperative electric association.

analyze the cost-effectiveness of the utility's or association's conservation programs, using a list of
baseline energy and capacity savings assumptions developed in consultation with the department.
The commissioner shall review each evaluation and make recommendations, where appropriate, to
the municipality or association to increase the effectiveness of conservation improvement activities.

From July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011, expenditures made to refurbish a district heating or
cooling system are considered to be load-management activities under paragraph (e). This paragraph
expires July 1, 2011.
   (i) The commissioner shall consider and may require a utility, association, or other entity
providing energy efficiency and conservation services under this section to undertake a program
suggested by an outside source, including a political subdivision, nonprofit corporation, or
community organization.
      Subd. 1c. Energy-saving goals. (a) The commissioner shall establish energy-saving goals
40TH DAY]                                      THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2007                                                                 1793

for energy conservation improvement expenditures and shall evaluate an energy conservation
improvement program on how well it meets the goals set.
    (b) Each individual utility and association shall have an annual energy-savings goal equivalent to
1.5 percent of gross annual retail energy sales unless modified by the commissioner under paragraph
(d). The savings goals must be calculated based on the most recent three-year weather normalized
average.
   (c) The commissioner must adopt a filing schedule that is designed to have all utilities and
associations operating under an energy savings plan by calendar year 2010.
    (d) In its energy conservation improvement plan filing, a utility or association may request
the commissioner to adjust its annual energy savings percentage goal based on its historical
conservation investment experience, customer class makeup, load growth, a conservation potential
study, or other factors the commissioner determines warrants an adjustment. The commissioner
may not approve a plan that provides for an annual energy savings goal of less than one percent of
gross annual retail energy sales from energy conservation improvements. A utility or association
may include in its energy conservation plan energy savings from an electric utility infrastructure
project or waste heat recovery converted into electricity project approved by the commission under
section 216B.1636 that may count as energy savings in addition to the minimum energy savings
goal of at least one percent for energy conservation improvements. Electric utility infrastructure
projects must result in increased energy efficiency greater than that which would have occurred
through normal maintenance activity.
    (e) An energy savings goal is not satisfied by attaining the revenue expenditure requirements of
subdivisions 1a and 1b, but can only be satisfied by meeting the energy savings goal established in
this subdivision.
    (f) An association or utility is not required to make energy conservation investments to attain
the energy savings goals of this subdivision that are not cost-effective even if the investment is
necessary to attain the energy savings goals. For the purpose of this paragraph, in determining
cost-effectiveness, the commissioner shall consider the costs and benefits to ratepayers, the
utility, participants, and society. In addition, the commissioner shall consider the rate at which an
association or municipal utility is increasing its energy savings and its expenditures on energy
conservation.
    (g) On an annual basis, the commissioner shall produce and make publicly available a report
on the annual energy savings and estimated carbon dioxide reductions achieved by the energy
conservation improvement programs for the two most recent years for which data is available. The
commissioner shall report on program performance both in the aggregate and for each entity filing
an energy conservation improvement plan for approval or review by the commissioner.
    (h) By January 15, 2010, the commissioner shall report to the legislature whether the spending
requirements under subdivisions 1a and 1b are necessary to achieve the energy savings goals
established in this subdivision.

    The commissioner shall evaluate energy conservation improvement programs on the basis of
cost-effectiveness and the reliability of the technologies employed. The commissioner shall, by
order, establish, maintain and update energy savings assumptions that must be used when filing
energy conservation improvement programs. The commissioner shall establish an inventory of
the most effective energy conservation programs, techniques, and technologies, and encourage
all Minnesota utilities to implement them, where appropriate, in their service territories. The
commissioner shall describe these programs in sufficient detail to provide a utility reasonable
guidance concerning implementation. The commissioner shall prioritize the opportunities in order
of potential energy savings and in order of cost-effectiveness. The commissioner may contract with
a third party to carry out any of the commissioner's duties under this subdivision, and to obtain
technical assistance to evaluate the effectiveness of any conservation improvement program. The
commissioner may assess up to $800,000 annually until June 30, 2009, and $450,000 annually
thereafter for the purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited in the state
treasury and credited to the energy and conservation account created under subdivision 2a. An
assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to the cap on assessments provided by
section 216B.62, or any other law.
    Subd. 1e. Applied research and development grants. The commissioner may, by order,
approve and make grants for applied research and development projects of general applicability
that identify new technologies or strategies to maximize energy savings, improve the effectiveness
of energy conservation programs, or document the carbon dioxide reductions from energy
conservation programs. When approving projects, the commissioner shall consider proposals
and comments from utilities and other interested parties. The commissioner may assess up to
$3,600,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision. The assessments must be deposited in
the state treasury and credited to the energy and conservation account created under subdivision
2a. An assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to the cap on assessments provided
by section 216B.62, or any other law.
   Subd. 1f. Facilities energy efficiency. (a) The commissioner of administration and the
commissioner of commerce shall maintain and, as needed, revise the sustainable building design
guidelines developed under section 16B.325.
    (b) The commissioner of administration and the commissioner of commerce shall maintain
and update the benchmarking tool developed under Laws 2001, chapter 212, article 1, section 3,
so that all public buildings can use the benchmarking tool to maintain energy use information for
the purposes of establishing energy efficiency benchmarks, tracking building performance and
measuring the results of energy efficiency and conservation improvements.
    (c) The commissioner shall require that utilities include in their conservation improvement
plans programs that facilitate professional engineering verification to qualify a building as Energy
Star-labeled or as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified. The state
goal is to achieve certification of 1,000 commercial buildings as Energy Star-labeled, and 100

commercial buildings as LEED-certified by December 31, 2010.
    (d) The commissioner may assess up to $500,000 annually for the purposes of this subdivision.
The assessments must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the energy and conservation
account created under subdivision 2a. An assessment made under this subdivision is not subject to
the cap on assessments provided by section 216B.62, or any other law.
     Subd. 2. Programs. (a) The commissioner may require public utilities to make investments and
expenditures in energy conservation improvements, explicitly setting forth the interest rates, prices,
and terms under which the improvements must be offered to the customers. The required programs
must cover no more than a ­             fo­u

basis of cost-effectiveness and the reliability of technologies employed. The commissioner's order
must provide to the extent practicable for a free choice, by consumers participating in the program,
of the device, method, material, or project constituting the energy conservation improvement and
for a free choice of the seller, installer, or contractor of the energy conservation improvement,
provided that the device, method, material, or project seller, installer, or contractor is duly licensed,
certified, approved, or qualified, including under the residential conservation services program,
where applicable.
   (b) The commissioner may require a utility to make an energy conservation improvement
investment or expenditure whenever the commissioner finds that the improvement will result in
energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an
equivalent amount of new supply of energy. The commissioner shall nevertheless ensure that every
public utility operate one or more programs under periodic review by the department.
    (c) Each public utility subject to subdivision 1a may spend and invest annually up to ten percent
of the total amount required to be spent and invested on energy conservation improvements under
this section by the utility on research and development projects that meet the definition of energy
conservation improvement in subdivision 1 and that are funded directly by the public utility.
    (d) A public utility may not spend for or invest in energy conservation improvements that directly
benefit a large energy facility or a large electric customer facility for which the commissioner has
issued an exemption pursuant to subdivision 1a, paragraph (b). The commissioner shall consider and
may require a utility to undertake a program suggested by an outside source, including a political
subdivision o r, a nonprofit corporation, or community organization.

    (g
     ­­) (e) A utility, a political subdivision, or a nonprofit or community organization that has
suggested a program, the attorney general acting on behalf of consumers and small business
interests, or a utility customer that has suggested a program and is not represented by the attorney
general under section 8.33 may petition the commission to modify or revoke a department
decision under this section, and the commission may do so if it determines that the program is
not cost-effective, does not adequately address the residential conservation improvement needs of
low-income persons, has a long-range negative effect on one or more classes of customers, or is
otherwise not in the public interest. The commission shall reject a petition that, on its face, fails to
make a reasonable argument that a program is not in the public interest.
    ­
    (h
     ­­) (f) The commissioner may order a public utility to include, with the filing of the utility's
proposed conservation improvement plan under paragraph (a), the results of an independent audit
of the utility's conservation improvement programs and expenditures performed by the department
or an auditor with experience in the provision of energy conservation and energy efficiency services
approved by the commissioner and chosen by the utility. The audit must specify the energy savings
or increased efficiency in the use of energy within the service territory of the utility that is the
result of the spending and investments. The audit must evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utility's
conservation programs.

    Subd. 2b. Recovery of expenses. The commission shall allow a utility to recover expenses
resulting from a conservation improvement program required by the department and contributions
and assessments to the energy and conservation account, unless the recovery would be inconsistent
with a financial incentive proposal approved by the commission. The commission shall allow
a cooperative electric association subject to rate regulation under section 216B.026, to recover
expenses resulting from energy conservation improvement programs, load management programs,
and assessments and contributions to the energy and conservation account unless the recovery
would be inconsistent with a financial incentive proposal approved by the commission. In addition,
a utility may file annually, or the Public Utilities Commission may require the utility to file, and
the commission may approve, rate schedules containing provisions for the automatic adjustment
of charges for utility service in direct relation to changes in the expenses of the utility for real
and personal property taxes, fees, and permits, the amounts of which the utility cannot control. A
public utility is eligible to file for adjustment for real and personal property taxes, fees, and permits
under this subdivision only if, in the year previous to the year in which it files for adjustment, it
has spent or invested at least 1.75 percent of its gross revenues from provision of electric service,
excluding gross operating revenues from electric service provided in the state to large electric
customer facilities for which the commissioner has issued an exemption under subdivision 1a,
paragraph (b), and 0.6 percent of its gross revenues from provision of gas service, excluding gross
operating revenues from gas services provided in the state to large electric customer facilities for
which the commissioner has issued an exemption under subdivision 1a, paragraph (b), for that year
for energy conservation improvements under this section.
   Subd. 2c. Performance incentives. By December 31, 2008, the commission shall review
any incentive plan for energy conservation improvement it has approved under section 216B.16,
subdivision 6c, and adjust the utility performance incentives to recognize making progress toward
and meeting the energy savings goals established in subdivision 1c.
    Subd. 3. Ownership of energy conservation improvement. An energy conservation
improvement made to or installed in a building in accordance with this section, except systems
owned by the utility and designed to turn off, limit, or vary the delivery of energy, are the exclusive
property of the owner of the building except to the extent that the improvement is subjected to
a security interest in favor of the utility in case of a loan to the building owner. The utility has
no liability for loss, damage or injury caused directly or indirectly by an energy conservation
improvement except for negligence by the utility in purchase, installation, or modification of the
product.
    Subd. 4. Federal law prohibitions. If investments by public utilities in energy conservation
improvements are in any manner prohibited or restricted by federal law and there is a provision under
which the prohibition or restriction may be waived, then the commission, the governor, or any other
necessary state agency or officer shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to secure a waiver
with respect to those public utility investments in energy conservation improvements included in
this section.
   Subd. 5. Efficient lighting program. (a) Each public utility, cooperative electric association,
and municipal utility that provides electric service to retail customers shall include as part of its
conservation improvement activities a program to strongly encourage the use of fluorescent and
high-intensity discharge lamps. The program must include at least a public information campaign

to encourage use of the lamps and proper management of spent lamps by all customer classifications.
    (b) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to 200,000 or more customers shall
establish, either directly or through contracts with other persons, including lamp manufacturers,
distributors, wholesalers, and retailers and local government units, a system to collect for delivery
to a reclamation or recycling facility spent fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps from
households and from small businesses as defined in section 645.445 that generate an average of
fewer than ten spent lamps per year.
    (c) A collection system must include establishing reasonably convenient locations for collecting
spent lamps from households and financial incentives sufficient to encourage spent lamp generators
to take the lamps to the collection locations. Financial incentives may include coupons for purchase
of new fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps, a cash back system, or any other financial
incentive or group of incentives designed to collect the maximum number of spent lamps from
households and small businesses that is reasonably feasible.
   (d) A public utility that provides electric service at retail to fewer than 200,000 customers,
a cooperative electric association, or a municipal utility that provides electric service at retail to
customers may establish a collection system under paragraphs (b) and (c) as part of conservation
improvement activities required under this section.
    (e) The commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency may not, unless clearly required by
federal law, require a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipality that establishes
a household fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamp collection system under this section to
manage the lamps as hazardous waste as long as the lamps are managed to avoid breakage and
are delivered to a recycling or reclamation facility that removes mercury and other toxic materials
contained in the lamps prior to placement of the lamps in solid waste.
   (f) If a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal utility contracts with a local
government unit to provide a collection system under this subdivision, the contract must provide for
payment to the local government unit of all the unit's incremental costs of collecting and managing
spent lamps.
    (g) All the costs incurred by a public utility, cooperative electric association, or municipal
utility for promotion and collection of fluorescent and high-intensity discharge lamps under this
subdivision are conservation improvement spending under this section.
    Subd. 6. Renewable energy research. (a) A public utility that owns a nuclear generation
facility in the state shall spend five percent of the total amount that utility is required to spend under
this section to support basic and applied research and demonstration activities at the University of
Minnesota Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment for the development of renewable
energy sources and technologies. The utility shall transfer the required amount to the University
of Minnesota on or before July 1 of each year and that annual amount shall be deducted from the
amount of money the utility is required to spend under this section. The University of Minnesota
shall transfer at least ten percent of these funds to at least one rural campus or experiment station.
   (b) Research funded under this subdivision shall include:
   (1) development of environmentally sound production, distribution, and use of energy,
chemicals, and materials from renewable sources;

    (2) processing and utilization of agricultural and forestry plant products and other bio-based,
renewable sources as a substitute for fossil-fuel-based energy, chemicals, and materials using a
variety of means including biocatalysis, biorefining, and fermentation;
    (3) conversion of state wind resources to hydrogen for energy storage and transportation to areas
of energy demand;
   (4) improvements in scalable hydrogen fuel cell technologies; and
   (5) production of hydrogen from bio-based, renewable sources; and sequestration of carbon.
    (c) Notwithstanding other law to the contrary, the utility may, but is not required to, spend more
than two percent of its gross operating revenues from service provided in this state under this section
or section 216B.2411.
   (d) This subdivision expires June 30, 2008.
     Subd. 7. Low-income programs. (a) The commissioner shall ensure that each utility and
association provides low-income programs. When approving spending and energy savings goals
for low-income programs, the commissioner shall consider historic spending and participation
levels, energy savings for low-income programs, and the number of low-income persons residing in
the utility's service territory. A utility that furnishes gas service must spend at least 0.2 percent of its
gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. A utility
or association that furnishes electric service must spend at least 0.1 percent of its gross operating
revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs. For a generation and
transmission cooperative association, this requirement shall apply to each association's members'
aggregate gross operating revenue from sale of electricity to residential customers in the state.
Beginning in 2010, a utility or association that furnishes electric service must spend 0.2 percent of
its gross operating revenue from residential customers in the state on low-income programs.
    (b) To meet the requirements of paragraph (a), a utility or association may contribute money
to the energy and conservation account. An energy conservation improvement plan must state the
amount, if any, of low-income energy conservation improvement money the utility or association
will contribute to the energy and conservation account. Contributions must be remitted to the
commissioner by February 1 of each year.
    (c) The commissioner shall establish low-income programs to utilize money contributed to
the energy and conservation account under paragraph (b). In establishing low-income programs,
the commissioner shall consult political subdivisions, utilities, and nonprofit and community
organizations, especially organizations engaged in providing energy and weatherization assistance
to low-income persons. Money contributed to the energy and conservation account under paragraph
(b) must provide programs for low-income persons, including low-income renters, in the service
territory of the utility or association providing the money. The commissioner shall record and report
expenditures and energy savings achieved as a result of low-income programs funded through the
energy and conservation account in the report required under subdivision 1c, paragraph (g). The
commissioner may contract with a political subdivision, nonprofit or community organization,
public utility, municipality, or cooperative electric association to implement low-income programs
funded through the energy and conservation account.
   (d) A utility or association may petition the commissioner to modify its required spending under
1800                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [40TH DAY

paragraph (a) if the utility or association and the commissioner have been unable to expend the
amount required under paragraph (a) for three consecutive years.
    Subd. 8. Assessment. The commission or department may assess utilities subject to this section
in proportion to their respective gross operating revenue from sales of gas or electric service within
the state during the last calendar year to carry out the purposes of subdivisions 1d, 1e, and 1f. Those
assessments are not subject to the cap on assessments provided by section 216B.62, or any other
law.
   Sec. 6. [216B.2412] DECOUPLING OF ENERGY SALES FROM REVENUES.
    Subdivision 1. Definition and purpose. For the purpose of this section, "decoupling" means a
regulatory tool designed to separate a utility's revenue from changes in energy sales. The purpose
of decoupling is to reduce a utility's disincentive to promote energy efficiency.
    Subd. 2. Decoupling criteria. The commission shall, by order, establish criteria and standards
for decoupling. The commission shall design the criteria and standards to mitigate the impact on
public utilities of the energy savings goals under section 216B.241 without adversely affecting utility
ratepayers. In designing the criteria, the commission shall consider energy efficiency, weather, and
cost of capital, among other factors.
    Subd. 3. Pilot programs. The commission shall allow one or more rate-regulated utilities to
participate in a pilot program to assess the merits of a rate-decoupling strategy to promote energy
efficiency and conservation. Each pilot program must utilize the criteria and standards established
in subdivision 2 and be designed to determine whether a rate-decoupling strategy achieves energy
savings. On or before a date established by the commission, the commission shall require electric
and gas utilities that intend to implement a decoupling program to file a decoupling pilot plan, which
shall be approved or approved as modified by the commission. A pilot program may not exceed
three years in length. Any extension beyond three years can only be approved in a general rate
case, unless that decoupling program was previously approved as part of a general rate case. The
commission shall report on the programs annually to the chairs of the house of representatives and
senate committees with primary jurisdiction over energy policy.

       Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 471.345, subdivision 13, is amended to read:
       Subd. 13. Energy efficiency projects. The following definitions apply to this subdivision.
   (a) "Energy conservation measure" means a training program or facility alteration designed to
reduce energy consumption or operating costs and includes:
       (1) insulation of the building structure and systems within the building;
   (2) storm windows and doors, caulking or weatherstripping, multiglazed windows and doors,
heat absorbing or heat reflective glazed and coated window and door systems, additional glazing,
reductions in glass area, and other window and door system modifications that reduce energy
consumption;

   (3) automatic energy control systems;
   (4) heating, ventilating, or air conditioning system modifications or replacements;
    (5) replacement or modifications of lighting fixtures to increase the energy efficiency of the
lighting system without increasing the overall illumination of a facility, unless an increase in
illumination is necessary to conform to the applicable state or local building code for the lighting
system after the proposed modifications are made;
   (6) energy recovery systems;
    (7) cogeneration systems that produce steam or forms of energy such as heat, as well as
electricity, for use primarily within a building or complex of buildings;
   (8) energy conservation measures that provide long-term operating cost reductions.
     (b) "Guaranteed energy savings contract" means a contract for the evaluation and
recommendations of energy conservation measures, and for one or more energy conservation
measures. The contract must provide that all payments, except obligations on termination of the
contract before its expiration, are to be made over time, but not to exceed 15 years from the date
of final installation, and the savings are guaranteed to the extent necessary to make payments for
the systems.
   (c) "Qualified provider" means a person or business experienced in the design, implementation,
and installation of energy conservation measures. A qualified provider to whom the contract is
awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the municipality for its faithful performance.
   Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy
savings contract with a qualified provider to significantly reduce energy or operating costs.
    Before entering into a contract under this subdivision, the municipality shall provide published
notice of the meeting in which it proposes to award the contract, the names of the parties to the
proposed contract, and the contract's purpose.
    Before installation of equipment, modification, or remodeling, the qualified provider shall first
issue a report, summarizing estimates of all costs of installations, modifications, or remodeling,
including costs of design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, or debt service, and
estimates of the amounts by which energy or operating costs will be reduced.
    A guaranteed energy savings contract that includes a written guarantee that savings will meet or
exceed the cost of energy conservation measures is not subject to competitive bidding requirements
of section 471.345 or other law or city charter. The contract is not subject to section 123B.52.
     A municipality may enter into a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider
if, after review of the report, it finds that the amount it would spend on the energy conservation
measures recommended in the report is not likely to exceed the amount to be saved in energy and
operation costs over 15 years from the date of installation if the recommendations in the report were
followed, and the qualified provider provides a written guarantee that the energy or operating cost
savings will meet or exceed the costs of the system. The guaranteed energy savings contract may
provide for payments over a period of time, not to exceed 15 years.
   A municipality may enter into an installment payment contract for the purchase and installation

of energy conservation measures. The contract must provide for payments of not less than 1/15 of
the price to be paid within two years from the date of the first operation, and the remaining costs to
be paid monthly, not to exceed a 15-year term from the date of the first operation.
    A municipality entering into a guaranteed energy savings contract shall provide a copy of the
contract and the report from the qualified provider to the commissioner of commerce within 30 days
of the effective date of the contract.
    Guaranteed energy savings contracts may extend beyond the fiscal year in which they become
effective. The municipality shall include in its annual appropriations measure for each later fiscal
year any amounts payable under guaranteed energy savings contracts during the year. Failure of a
municipality to make such an appropriation does not affect the validity of the guaranteed energy
savings contract or the municipality's obligations under the contracts.
     Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 504B.161, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Requirements. In every lease or license of residential premises, the landlord or
licensor covenants:
     (1) that the premises and all common areas are fit for the use intended by the parties;
    (2) to keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license, except when
the disrepair has been caused by the willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct of the tenant or
licensee or a person under the direction or control of the tenant or licensee; and
    (3) to make the premises reasonably energy efficient by installing weatherstripping, caulking,
storm windows, and storm doors when the measure will result in energy procurement cost savings,
based on current and projected average residential energy costs in this state, that will exceed the
cost of implementing the measure, including interest, amortized over the ten-year period following
the incurring of the cost; and
    (4) to maintain the premises in compliance with the applicable health and safety laws of the
state, ­n
