Section 1. SUMMARY OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    The amounts shown in this section summarize direct appropriations, by fund, made in this article.

    Sec. 2. SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY GRANTS.
   Subdivision 1. Program outcomes. The general framework outcomes for technology use in
kindergarten through grade 12 education are:
    (1) development of policies and procedures that assure instructional resource availability to help
students successfully achieve education excellence and state standards;
    (2) development of databases that are accessible within each district and on the Internet;
    (3) development of policies, procedures, and systems that stimulate and promote teacher and
student curriculum and learning collaboration; and
    (4) development of uniform technology standards.
    Subd. 2. Establishment; eligibility. To promote the outcomes of subdivision 1, a program is

established to support districts and charter schools in reaching these outcomes. Districts and charter
schools eligible to participate under this section must have an approved district technology plan
submitted to the commissioner. The commissioner shall develop a competitive grant process for
the purpose of determining recipients. Districts and charter schools must propose to use the grant
funds that support the outcomes described in subdivision 1 in a manner that fulfills the following
components in rank order by:
   (1) obtaining minimum statewide standards of technology infrastructure and capacity;
   (2) incorporating student technology content standards within the district curriculum and the
professional development necessary for effective instruction of those standards;
   (3) developing data-driven decision-making models in the classroom, school, and district; and
   (4) developing innovation in student learning and teacher professional development.
    Subd. 3. Application and review process; funding priority. Districts and charter schools
eligible under subdivision 2 may apply to the commissioner, in the form and manner the
commissioner determines, for competitive funding to achieve the four grant goals. The application
must identify, through a commonly-used technology audit process that determines the district
or charter school's current technology capabilities, the disparity between the district or charter
school's current technology infrastructure and capacity and the minimum statewide standards
that are established by the commissioner. The application must detail the specific efforts the
applicant intends to undertake to achieve the components, consistent with subdivision 2, and a
proposed budget detailing the district or charter school's current and proposed expenditures. The
proposed budget must demonstrate that the applicant's efforts will support the four components of
subdivision 2 in rank order. Expenditures for administration must not exceed five percent of the
proposed budget. The commissioner may require an applicant to provide additional information.
When reviewing applications, the commissioner must determine whether the applicant satisfied
all the requirements in this subdivision and subdivision 2. The commissioner may give funding
priority to an otherwise qualified applicant that demonstrates:
    (1) previous attempts through district referenda or other funding mechanisms to increase its
technology infrastructure and capacity;
   (2) previous efforts to participate in online field testing of statewide assessments; or
    (3) an effective ability to actively involve local business and community organizations in efforts
to stimulate and promote teacher and student curriculum and learning collaboration.
    Subd. 4. Application review; grant awards. The commissioner shall award grants to applicant
school districts and charter schools that meet the requirements of subdivisions 1 and 2. The
commissioner may award grants as funding allows and, to the extent feasible, must distribute
the grant awards on an equitable geographical basis. The commissioner must base the amount
of the grant award on the number of students in the participating district or charter school.
District expenditures of the grant proceeds must be consistent with budget information the grantee
periodically submits to the commissioner. School districts and charter schools that submit an
application and receive funding under this section must use the funding, consistent with the
components in subdivision 2, as stated in the application. The commissioner may spend up to one
percent of the appropriation for administering the program.

    Subd. 5. Annual reports. Each school district and charter school that receives a grant under this
section must demonstrate and measure the extent to which the district or charter school achieved the
outcomes set forth in the grant application and consistent with subdivision 1. This report is due at
the end of the grant period and must be submitted to the commissioner in the form and manner
the commissioner determines. The commissioner must make summary data about this program
available to the education policy and finance committees of the legislature by February 15, 2010.
Each school district and charter school that receives a grant under this section annually must report
to the commissioner, consistent with the uniform financial accounting and reporting standards, its
actual expenditures for school technology funding. The report must demonstrate that the school
district or charter school has maintained its effort from other sources for technology and capacity
compared with the previous fiscal year, and the district or charter school has expended all grant
funds, consistent with its approved budget.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.
   Sec. 3. APPROPRIATIONS.
   Subdivision 1. Department of Education. The sums indicated in this section are appropriated
from the general fund to the Department of Education for the fiscal years designated.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear Senator President
    Pursuant to Article IV, Section 11, of the Minnesota Constitution, the following Members of
the Minnesota State Senate hereby Dissent and Protest to the following acts of the Minnesota State
Senate because we believe they injure the citizens of the State of Minnesota in the following manner:
   1. S.F. 1611 is a bill that passed the Senate on March 31, 2007.
    2. S.F. 1611 contains new education policies and $443.7 million in new appropriations for fiscal
years 2008 and 2009, which is the second largest spending bill to be considered by the Senate
in 2007. These appropriations and policies affect pre-school education, child care providers, K-12
public and nonpublic schools, tribal contract schools, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities,
the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Education, the Minnesota Department
of Human Services, and the Minnesota Office of Higher Education.
    3. S.F. 1611 also contains significant tax increases on the personal income of Minnesota
taxpayers by creating a new income tax bracket, a new income tax rate, and changes to the existing
alternative minimum tax. These combined changes to Minnesota's tax code are projected to
increase taxes by $993.1 million for fiscal year 2008 and 2009.
     4. S.F. 1611 misleads the public and is not honest, straightforward, or transparent because its
title does not indicate a tax increase is contained within the bill.
   5. S.F. 1611 does not follow the budget process set forth in Rule 7 of the Minnesota Senate.
    6. S.F. 1611 is in clear violation of Article IV, Section 17, of the Minnesota Constitution, which
states that "No law shall embrace more than one subject." S.F. 1611 is an education policy and
spending bill as well as a revenue raising bill. This unconstitutional and illicit combining of more

than one subject in S.F. 1611 violates the wording, intent, and historical lawmaking process of the
State of Minnesota.
    The following Members of the Minnesota Senate hereby enter their Dissent and Protest by
signing below.
    Senators (Signed): Tom Neuville, David Hann, David Senjem, Dick Day, Chris Gerlach,
Michelle Fischbach, Julianne E. Ortman, Claire Robling, Geoff Michel, Amy T. Koch, Steve
