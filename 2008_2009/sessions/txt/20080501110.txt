    (­) Except as permitted under this subsection, a recording officer shall not file or record a
     f­
declaration creating a new common interest community, unless the county treasurer has certified
that the property taxes payable in the current year for the real estate included in the proposed
common interest community have been paid. This certification is in addition to the certification
for delinquent taxes required by section 272.12. In the case of preexisting common interest
communities, the recording officer shall accept, file, and record the following instruments, without
requiring a certification as to the current or delinquent taxes on any of the units in the common
interest community: (i) a declaration subjecting the common interest community to this chapter; (ii)
a declaration changing the form of a common interest community pursuant to section 515B.2-123;
or (iii) an amendment to or restatement of the declaration, bylaws, or CIC plat. In order for an
instrument to be accepted and recorded under the preceding sentence, the instrument must not
create or change unit or common area boundaries.
     Sec. 12. Laws 2006, chapter 269, section 2, is amended to read:
           Sec. 2. DEDICATION FEE.
    The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board and the Minneapolis City Council may jointly
exercise the powers conferred under Minnesota Statutes, section 462.358, with respect to requiring
that a reasonable portion of land be dedicated to the public or imposing a dedication fee on new
housing units and new commercial and industrial development in the city, wherever located, for
public parks, playgrounds, recreational facilities, wetlands, trails, or open space. The dedication of
land or dedication fee must be imposed by an ordinance jointly enacted by the park board and the
city council. The ordinance may exclude senior housing and affordable housing from paying the fee
or the dedication of land. The provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 462.358, subdivisions 2b,
paragraph (b), and 2c, apply to the imposition, application, and use of the dedication of land or the
dedication fee.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective upon compliance by the Minneapolis Park and
Recreation Board and the Minneapolis City Council with Minnesota Statutes, section 645.021."

     Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 11A.18, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 2a. Composite funded ratio. (a) Annually, following June 30, the executive director of
the State Board of Investment shall determine the composite funded ratio of the postretirement

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; divided by
   (2) the total reserves required as of June 30 for the annuities or benefits payable from the

assumptions in section 356.215.
    (b) The executive director of the State Board of Investment shall certify the composite funded

   (c) If the amount calculated under paragraph (b), clause (1), is greater than the maximum
amount allowable under paragraph (b), clause (2), in addition to any percentage increase certified
under paragraph (b), the board shall use the following procedures to determine if a postretirement
adjustment is payable under this paragraph:
     (1) the state board shall determine the total fair market value of the fund on June 30 of that year;
110TH DAY]                             THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008                                              9391

    (2) the amount of reserves required as of the current June 30 for the annuity or benefit payable
to an annuitant and benefit recipient of the participating public pension plans or funds must be
determined by the actuary retained under section 356.214. An annuitant or benefit recipient who has
been receiving an annuity or benefit for at least 12 full months as of the current June 30 is eligible to
receive a full postretirement adjustment. An annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving
an annuity or benefit for at least one full month, but less than 12 full months as of the current June
30, is eligible to receive a partial postretirement adjustment. Each fund shall report separately the
amount of the reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are eligible to receive a full
postretirement benefit adjustment. This amount is known as "eligible reserves." Each fund shall also
report separately the amount of the reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are not
eligible to receive a postretirement adjustment. This amount is known as "noneligible reserves."
For an annuitant or benefit recipient who is eligible to receive a partial postretirement adjustment,
each fund shall report separately as additional "eligible reserves" an amount that bears the same
ratio to the total reserves required for the annuitant or benefit recipient as the number of full months
of annuity or benefit receipt as of the current June 30 bears to 12 full months. The remainder of
the annuitant's or benefit recipient's reserves must be separately reported as additional "noneligible
reserves." The amount of "eligible" and "noneligible" required reserves must be certified to the board
by the actuary retained under section 356.214 as soon as is practical following the current June 30;
   (3) the state board shall determine the percentage increase certified under paragraph (b)
multiplied by the eligible required reserves, as adjusted for mortality gains and losses under
subdivision 11, determined under clause (2);
    (4) the state board shall add the amount of reserves required for the annuities or benefits payable
to annuitants and benefit recipients of the participating public pension plans or funds as of the current
June 30 to the amount determined under clause (3);
   (5) the state board shall subtract the amount determined under clause (4) from the total fair
market value of the fund determined under clause (1);
    (6) the state board shall adjust the amount determined under clause (5) by the cumulative current
balance determined under clause (8) and any negative balance carried forward under clause (9);
   (7) a positive amount resulting from the calculations in clauses (1) to (6) is the excess market
value. A negative amount is the negative balance;
    (8) the state board shall allocate one-fifth of the excess market value or one-fifth of the negative
balance to each of five consecutive years, beginning with the fiscal year ending the current June 30;
and
     (9) to calculate the postretirement adjustment under this paragraph ­           b­a­

that year and subtract from the sum all negative balances allocated to that year. If this calculation
results in a negative number, the entire negative balance must be carried forward and allocated to
the next year. If the resulting amount is positive, a postretirement adjustment is payable under this
paragraph. The board shall express a positive amount as a percentage of the total eligible required
reserves certified to the board under clause (2). The percentage determined under this paragraph
is not payable unless the amount calculated under paragraph (b), clause (1), is greater than 2.5
percent and must not exceed the difference by which the amount calculated under paragraph (b),
clause (1), exceeds 2.5 percent.

    (1) The total "eligible" required reserves as of the first of January next following the end of the
fiscal year for the annuitants and benefit recipients eligible to receive a full or partial postretirement
adjustment as determined by clause (2) must be certified to the state board by the actuary retained
under section 356.214. The total "eligible" required reserves must be determined by the actuary
retained under section 356.214 on the assumption that all annuitants and benefit recipients eligible
to receive a full or partial postretirement adjustment will be alive on the January 1 in question; and
     (2) The state board shall add the percentage certified under paragraph (b) to any positive
percentage calculated under paragraph (c). The board shall not subtract from the percentage
certified under paragraph (b) any negative amount calculated under paragraph (c). The sum of these
percentages m   ­u

    (e) A retirement annuity payable in the event of retirement before becoming eligible for Social
Security benefits as provided in section 352.116, subdivision 3; 353.29, subdivision 6; or 354.35
must be treated as the sum of a period certain retirement annuity and a life retirement annuity for
the purposes of any postretirement adjustment. The period certain retirement annuity plus the life
retirement annuity must be the annuity amount payable until age 62 or 65, whichever applies. A
postretirement adjustment granted on the period certain retirement annuity must terminate when the
period certain retirement annuity terminates.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2008.
    Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 11A.18, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
   Subd. 9a. Lost purchasing power increase. (a) This subdivision applies for fiscal years ending
June 30 in which all of the following conditions exist:
   (1) the composite funded ratio for the postretirement investment fund as of June 30, as certified
by the executive director of the State Board of Investment under subdivision 2a is more than 90
percent;
    (2) the State Board of Investment determines that the time-weighted total rate of return on
investment of assets in the postretirement investment fund for the fiscal year ending June 30 exceeds
8.5 percent; and
   (3) the postretirement adjustment percentage certified under subdivision 9, paragraph (b), is less
than 2.5 percent.
    (b) The lost purchasing power postretirement increase is payable the following January 1.
    (c) Each participating public pension plan must annually calculate:
    (1) the cumulative postretirement adjustment percentage applied to the annuity or benefit paid
to each eligible annuitant and benefit recipient since the person first received a postretirement

adjustment; and
    (2) the increase in the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all
items index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor
from June 30 of the year before the person first received a postretirement adjustment to June 30 of the
current year. If a person received a prorated increase under subdivision 9, paragraph (c), clause (2),
the same ratio of the number of months receiving a monthly benefit to 12 months must be applied to
the inflation calculation for the fiscal year used to calculate the prorated amount of lost purchasing
power for that period.
    (d) If the percentage in paragraph (c), clause (2), is greater than the percentage in paragraph (c),
clause (1), with respect to an eligible annuitant or benefit recipient, and the conditions in paragraph
(a) exist, that person is eligible to receive an increase under this subdivision.
    (e) The percentage increase payable to an eligible annuitant or benefit recipient under this
subdivision may not exceed the difference between 2.5 percent and the amount certified under
subdivision 9 or the amount calculated under paragraph (c), whichever is lower. The percentage
increase otherwise payable under this subdivision must be reduced as provided in paragraph (f).
   (f) The actuary retained under section 356.214 must determine:
    (1) the reserves that would be required to pay in full the adjustments determined under paragraph
(c); and
    (2) the excess market value necessary to maintain the accrued liability composite funding ratio
determined under subdivision 2a is at least 90 percent. If the calculated result under clause (1) of
this paragraph is greater than the calculated result under clause (2), the increase payable to each
eligible annuitant or benefit recipient under this subdivision must be reduced to that portion of the
full potential increase amount that equals the ratio that the calculated result under clause (2) bears
to the calculated result under clause (1).
    (g) A percentage increase certified under this subdivision must be added to the percentage
certified under subdivision 9 and the total resulting percentage must be certified to each participating
public pension plan as the full postretirement adjustment percentage.
   EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective June 30, 2008.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 11A.18, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 9b. Excess assets trigger. If the composite funded ratio of the postretirement investment
fund determined under subdivision 2a is 115 percent or greater as of June 30 of any year, the
governing bodies of the retirement plans participating in the postretirement investment fund must
jointly report to the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement by the next January 15. The
report must evaluate and make recommendations with respect to the overall benefits and funding of
the retirement funds for both active employees and benefit recipients.

    (a) Disability benefits payable to a disabilitant, if not otherwise included in the participation in
the Minnesota postretirement investment fund, and survivor benefits payable to a survivor from any
public pension plan which participates in the Minnesota postretirement investment fund must be
adjusted in the same manner, at the same times and in the same amounts as are benefits payable
from the Minnesota postretirement investment fund to comparable eligible benefit recipients of that
public pension plan.
    (b) If a disability benefit is not included in the participation in the Minnesota postretirement
investment fund, the disability benefit is recomputed as a retirement annuity and the recipient would
have been eligible for an adjustment under this section if the disability benefit was not recomputed,
the recipient remains eligible for the adjustment under this section after the recomputation.
    (c) For the survivor of a deceased annuitant who receives a survivor benefit calculated under
a prior law rather than the second portion of a joint and survivor annuity, any period of receipt
of a retirement annuity by the annuitant must be utilized in determining the period of receipt for
eligibility to receive an adjustment under this section.
   (d) No recipient, however, is entitled to more than one adjustment under this section or section

   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2007 Supplement, section 422A.06, subdivision 8, is amended to
read:
   Subd. 8. Retirement benefit fund. (a) The retirement benefit fund consists of amounts held for
payment of retirement allowances for members retired under this chapter, including any transfer
amount payable under subdivision 3, paragraph (c).
    (b) Unless subdivision 3, paragraph (c), applies, assets equal to the required reserves for
retirement allowances under this chapter determined in accordance with the appropriate mortality
table adopted by the board of trustees based on the experience of the fund as recommended by the
actuary retained under section 356.214 must be transferred from the deposit accumulation fund
to the retirement benefit fund as of the last business day of the month in which the retirement
allowance begins. The income from investments of these assets must be allocated to this fund and
any interest charge under subdivision 3, paragraph (c), must be credited to the fund. There must be
paid from this fund the retirement annuities authorized by law. A required reserve calculation for
the retirement benefit fund must be made by the actuary retained under section 356.214 and must
be certified to the retirement board by the actuary retained under section 356.214.

    (c) There is hereby established a deferred yield adjustment account which must be increased by
the sale or disposition of any debt securities at less than book value and must be decreased by the
sale or disposition of debt securities at more than book value. At the end of each fiscal year, a portion
of the balance of this account must be offset against the investment income for that year. The annual
portion of the balance to be offset must be proportional to the reciprocal of the average remaining life
of the bonds sold, unless the amounts are offset by gains on the future sales of these securities. The
amount of this account must be included in the recognized value of assets other than corporate stocks
and all other equity investments. In any fiscal year in which the gains on the sales of debt securities
exceed the discounts realized on the sales of such securities, the excess must be used to reduce the
balance of the account. If the realized capital gains are sufficient to reduce the balance of the account
to zero, any excess gains must be available for the calculation of postretirement adjustments.
    (d) (1) Annually, following June 30, the board shall use the procedures in clauses (2), (3), and
(4) to determine whether a postretirement adjustment is payable and to determine the amount of any
postretirement adjustment.
    (2) If the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers all items index
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor increases
from June 30 of the preceding year to June 30 of the current year, the board shall certify the
percentage increase. The amount certified must not exceed the lesser of the difference between
the preretirement interest assumption and postretirement interest assumption in section 356.215,
subdivision 8, paragraph (a), or 3.5 percent.
    (3) In addition to any percentage increase certified under paragraph (b), the board shall use the
following procedures to determine if a postretirement adjustment is payable under this paragraph:
    (i) The board shall determine the market value of the fund on June 30 of that year;
    (ii) The amount of reserves required as of the current June 30 for the annuity or benefit payable to
an annuitant and benefit recipient must be determined by the actuary retained under section 356.214.
An annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or benefit for at least 12 full
months as of the current June 30 is eligible to receive a full postretirement adjustment. An annuitant
or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or benefit for at least one full month, but
less than 12 full months as of the current June 30, is eligible to receive a partial postretirement
adjustment. The amount of the reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are eligible
to receive a full postretirement benefit adjustment is known as "eligible reserves." The amount of the
reserves for those annuitants and benefit recipients who are not eligible to receive a postretirement
adjustment is known as "noneligible reserves." For an annuitant or benefit recipient who is eligible
to receive a partial postretirement adjustment, additional "eligible reserves" is an amount that bears
the same ratio to the total reserves required for the annuitant or benefit recipient as the number of full
months of annuity or benefit receipt as of the current June 30 bears to 12 full months. The remainder
of the annuitant's or benefit recipient's reserves are "noneligible reserves";
    (iii) The board shall determine the percentage increase certified under clause (2) multiplied by
the eligible required reserves, as adjusted for mortality gains and losses, determined under item (ii);
    (iv) The board shall add the amount of reserves required for the annuities or benefits payable to
9396                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [110TH DAY

annuitants and benefit recipients of the participating public pension plans or funds as of the current
June 30 to the amount determined under item (iii);
   (v) The board shall subtract the amount determined under item (iv) from the market value of the
fund determined under item (i);
    (vi) The board shall adjust the amount determined under item (v) by the cumulative current
balance determined under item (viii) and any negative balance carried forward under item (ix);
   (vii) A positive amount resulting from the calculations in items (i) to (vi) is the excess market
value. A negative amount is the negative balance;
    (viii) The board shall allocate one-fifth of the excess market value or one-fifth of the negative
balance to each of five consecutive years, beginning with the fiscal year ending the current June 30;
and
    (ix) To calculate the postretirement adjustment under this paragraph based on investment
performance for a fiscal year, the board shall add together all excess market value allocated to
that year and subtract from the sum all negative balances allocated to that year. If this calculation
results in a negative number, the entire negative balance must be carried forward and allocated to
the next year. If the resulting amount is positive, a postretirement adjustment is payable under this
paragraph. The board shall express a positive amount as a percentage of the total eligible required
reserves certified to the board under item (ii).
    (4) The board shall determine the amount of any postretirement adjustment which is payable
using the following procedure:
    (i) The total "eligible" required reserves as of the first of January next following the end of the
fiscal year for the annuitants and benefit recipients eligible to receive a full or partial postretirement
adjustment as determined by item (ii) must be certified to the board by the actuary retained under
section 356.214. The total "eligible" required reserves must be determined by the actuary retained
under section 356.214 on the assumption that all annuitants and benefit recipients eligible to receive
a full or partial postretirement adjustment will be alive on the January 1 in question; and
    (ii) The board shall add the percentage certified under clause (2) to any positive percentage
calculated under clause (3). The board shall not subtract from the percentage certified under
paragraph (b) any negative amount calculated under clause (3). The sum of these percentages
must be carried to five decimal places and must be certified as the full postretirement adjustment
percentage.
    (e) The board shall determine the amount of the postretirement adjustment payable to each
eligible annuitant and benefit recipient. The dollar amount of the postretirement adjustment must
be calculated by applying the certified postretirement adjustment percentage to the amount of the
monthly annuity or benefit payable to each eligible annuitant or benefit recipient eligible for a full
adjustment.
    The dollar amount of the partial postretirement adjustment payable to each annuitant or benefit
recipient eligible for a partial adjustment must be calculated by first determining a partial percentage
amount that bears the same ratio to the certified full adjustment percentage amount as the number of
full months of annuity or benefit receipt as of the current June 30 bears to 12 full months. The partial
percentage amount determined must then be applied to the amount of the monthly annuity or benefit

payable to each annuitant or benefit recipient eligible to receive a partial postretirement adjustment.
The postretirement adjustments are payable on January 1 following the calculations required under
this section and must thereafter be included in the monthly annuity or benefit paid to the recipient.
Any adjustments under this section must be paid automatically unless the intended recipient files
a written notice with the applicable participating public pension fund or plan requesting that the
adjustment not be paid.
    (f) As of June 30 annually, the actuary retained under section 356.214 shall calculate the amount
of required reserves representing any mortality gains and any mortality losses incurred during the
fiscal year and report the results of those calculations to the plan. The actuary shall report separately
the amount of the reserves for annuitants and benefit recipients who are eligible for a postretirement
benefit adjustment and the amount of reserves for annuitants and benefit recipients who are not
eligible for a postretirement benefit adjustment. If the net amount of required reserves represents a
mortality gain, the board shall sell sufficient securities or transfer sufficient available cash to equal
the amount. If the amount of required reserves represents a mortality loss, the plan shall transfer an
amount equal to the amount of the net mortality loss. The amount of the transfers must be determined
before any postretirement benefit adjustments have been made. All transfers resulting from mortality
adjustments must be completed annually by December 31 for the preceding June 30. Interest is
payable on any transfers after December 31 based upon the preretirement interest assumption for
the participating plan or fund as specified in section 356.215, subdivision 8, stated as a monthly rate.
Book values of the assets of the fund must be determined only after all adjustments for mortality
gains and losses for the fiscal year have been made.
   (g) All money necessary to meet the requirements of the certification of withdrawals and all
money necessary to pay postretirement adjustments under this section are hereby and from time to
time appropriated from the postretirement investment fund to the board.
    ­
    (d
     ­­) (h) Annually, following the calculation of any postretirement adjustment payable from
the retirement benefit fund, the board of trustees shall submit a report to the executive director
of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement and to the commissioner of finance
indicating the amount of any postretirement adjustment and the underlying calculations on which
that postretirement adjustment amount is based, including the amount of dividends, the amount of
interest, and the amount of net realized capital gains or losses utilized in the calculations.

under section 422A.151, paragraph (a), clause (2), after June 30, 1997, the reserves attributable

INVESTMENT FUND.
    Subdivision 1. Conditions for dissolution. The postretirement investment fund established in

   (1) less than 85 percent and was less than 85 percent as of June 30 of the immediately preceding
year; or
   (2) less than 80 percent.
   Subd. 2. Transition. If conditions for dissolution of the postretirement investment fund under
subdivision 1 apply:
    (1) the retirement plans shall not transfer reserves as required under sections 11A.18, subdivision
6; 352.119, subdivision 2; 352B.26, subdivision 3; 353.271, subdivision 2; 354.63, subdivision

   (3) the assets of the postretirement investment fund must be transferred back to each participating
public retirement plan on June 30 of the year following the year in which conditions for dissolution
under subdivision 1 occur. The assets to be transferred to each public retirement plan must be
based on each plan's participation in the postretirement fund as determined under section 11A.18,
subdivision 7, on the June 30 when the transfer back to the plan occurs; and
    (4) The postretirement investment fund ceases to exist upon the transfer of all assets as required
in clause (3).
    Subd. 3. Postretirement adjustments. (a) Notwithstanding section 11A.18 or any other law
to the contrary, if the postretirement investment fund is dissolved, postretirement adjustments are
payable only as follows:
    (1) a postretirement increase of 2.5 percent must be applied each year, effective January 1, to
the monthly annuity or benefit of each annuitant and benefit recipient who has been receiving an
annuity or a benefit for at least 12 full months as of the prior January 1; and
    (2) for each annuitant or benefit recipient who has been receiving an annuity or a benefit for at
least one full month, an annual postretirement increase of 1/12 of 2.5 percent for each month the
person has been receiving an annuity or benefit must be applied, effective January 1 of the year in
which the person has been retired for less than 12 months.
    (b) The increases provided by this subdivision commence on the first January 1 occurring after
the postretirement fund is dissolved under subdivision 2.

section 353.31, an annuity equal to a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity computed consistent
with section 353.30, subdivision 1a, 1c, or 5, whichever is applicable.
   (b) If a member first became a public employee or a member of a pension fund listed in section

    (c) If a member who was under age 55 and has credit for at least three years of allowable service

but not a monthly surviving spouse optional annuity, despite the terms of a marriage dissolution

surviving spouse must be paid to the surviving spouse's estate.
    (h) A member may specify in writing, with the signed consent of the spouse, that this subdivision
does not apply and that payment may be made only to the designated beneficiary as otherwise
provided by this chapter. The waiver of a surviving spouse annuity under this section does not make
a dependent child eligible for benefits under subdivision 1c.

    (b) Notwithstanding the definition of surviving spouse in section 353.01, subdivision 20, a
former spouse of the member, if any, is entitled to a portion of the death while eligible survivor
benefit if stipulated under the terms of a marriage dissolution decree filed with the association. If
there is no surviving spouse or child or children, a former spouse may be entitled to a lump-sum
refund payment under section 353.32, subdivision 1, if provided for in a marriage dissolution
decree but not a death while eligible survivor benefit despite the terms of a marriage dissolution
decree filed with the association.
    (c) The benefit may be elected instead of a refund with interest under section 353.32, subdivision
1, or surviving spouse benefits otherwise payable under subdivisions 1 and 2. The benefit must be an

that the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity form, or a higher joint and survivor form if selected,
shall be paid if the spouse does not acknowledge the annuity form selected by the member by
responding to the second notice sent to the spouse within 30 days. The second notice must be sent
by certified mail with restricted delivery.
   (c) If a public pension plan administration receives notice that the provisions of this section
have not been complied with, or if a member selects a benefit form without the valid consent of the
member's spouse, the executive director of the public pension plan shall suspend the payment of
monthly benefits and shall take all actions necessary to comply with this subdivision.
   (d) For the Teachers Retirement Association, the statement to the spouse that is required under
paragraph (a) must be sent before or upon the member's election of an annuity.
    Subd. 4. Plan exclusions. This section does not apply to:
    (1) any volunteer fire relief association to which sections 69.771 to 69.776 apply; and
   (2) any plan under which the applicable surviving spouse would receive automatic surviving
spouse coverage if a joint and survivor annuity were not elected.
     Subd. 5. Disabilitant survivor treatment. This section should not be interpreted as prohibiting
payment of a survivor annuity to the spouse of a deceased disabilitant, in lieu of any other annuity,
if laws specific to the plan provide for a higher surviving spouse annuity.
   Subd. 6. Limitations due to marriage dissolution. The requirement to pay a 50 percent joint
and survivor annuity is void if there is a court order to the contrary.
    Subd. 7. Liability waiver. The pension fund and plan, its employees, and any agent working on
behalf of the plan administration are not liable for harm caused by any act of fraud committed by
the retiring member or current or previous spouse, or any information withheld from, or incorrect
information supplied to the plan administration.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009, and applies to annuities that are
elected and commence on or after that date.

this chapter during the leave or following the leave rather than returning to covered employment,
payment must be received by the executive director within 30 days after the termination date. The
payment amount is equal to the employee and employer contribution rates specified in law for the
applicable plan on the day prior to the termination date, multiplied by the employee's hourly rate of
salary on that date and by the days and months of the leave of absence prior to termination.
    EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from July 1, 2007.

    (b) The executive director shall compute, for the most recent 12 months of service credit eligible
for transfer, or for the entire period eligible for transfer if less than 12 months, the difference between
the employee contribution rate or rates for the general state employees retirement plan and the
employee contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees retirement plan applied
to the eligible employee's salary during that transfer period, plus compound interest at a monthly
rate of 0.71 percent.
    (c) The executive director shall compute, for any service credit being transferred on behalf of
the eligible employee and not included under paragraph (b), the difference between the employee
contribution rate or rates for the general state employees retirement plan and the employee
contribution rate or rates for the correctional state employees retirement plan applied to the eligible
employee's salary during that transfer period, plus compound interest at a monthly rate of 0.71
percent.
    (d) The executive director shall compute an amount using the process specified in paragraph
(b), but based on differences in employer contribution rates between the general state employees
retirement plan and the correctional state employees retirement plan rather than employee
contribution rates.
    (e) The executive director shall compute an amount using the process specified in paragraph
(c), but based on differences in employer contribution rates between the general state employees
retirement plan and the correctional state employees retirement plan rather than employee
contribution rates.
    (f) The additional equivalent member contribution under this subdivision must be paid in a lump
sum. Payment must accompany the election to transfer the prior service credit. No transfer election
or additional equivalent member contribution payment may be made by a person or accepted by the
executive director after the one year anniversary date of the effective date of the retirement coverage
transfer, or the date on which the eligible employee terminates state employment, whichever is
earlier.

    (c) This section does not obligate a public employer to meet and negotiate in good faith with
the exclusive bargaining representative of any public employee group regarding an employer
contribution to a postretirement or active employee health care savings plan authorized by this
section and section 356.24, subdivision 1, clause (7). It is not the intent of the legislature to
authorize the state to incur new funding obligations for the costs of retiree health care or the costs
of administering retiree health care plans or accounts.

beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar
year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under subdivision 2, paragraph
110TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008                                         9425

valuation calendar year increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated to the
account balance as of dates in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date and decreased
by distributions made in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date. The account balance
for the valuation calendar year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the plan either
in the valuation calendar year or in the distribution calendar year if distributed or transferred in the
valuation calendar year.
    (e) "Required beginning date" means the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the
calendar year that the member attains age 70.5 or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar
year in which the member terminates employment.
    (f) "Valuation calendar year" means the calendar year immediately preceding the distribution
calendar year.
    Subd. 2. Required Minimum Distributions. (a) The provisions of this subdivision shall apply
for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with
the 2003 calendar year and will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan.
All distributions required under this section will be determined and made in accordance with the
treasury regulations under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including regulations
providing special rules for governmental plans, as defined under Internal Revenue Code section
414(d), that comply with a reasonable good faith interpretation of the minimum distribution
requirements.
    (b) The member's entire interest will be distributed to the member in a lump sum no later than
the member's required beginning date.
    (c) If the member dies before the required minimum distribution is made, the member's entire
interest will be distributed in a lump sum no later than as follows:
    (1) If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, the distribution
must be made by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in
which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have
attained age 70.5, whichever is later;
     (2) If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole beneficiary, or if there is no
designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death,
the member's entire interest shall be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the
fifth anniversary of the member's death as directed under section 353D.07, subdivision 5; or
   (3) If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the
surviving spouse dies after the member but before the account balance is distributed to the surviving
spouse, paragraph (c), clause (2), shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the member.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (c), unless clause (3) applies, distributions are considered to be
made on the member's required beginning date. If paragraph (c), clause (3), applies, distributions
are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to be made to the surviving spouse
under paragraph (c), clause (1).

FACILITIES AND OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYING UNITS.
    Subdivision 1. Eligibility determination. (a) The chief clerical officer of a governmental
subdivision may submit a resolution from the governing body to the executive director of the
Public Employees Retirement Association which supports providing coverage under this chapter
for employees of that governmental subdivision who are privatized, and which states that the
governing body will pay for actuarial calculations, as further specified in paragraph (c).
   (b) The governing body must also provide a copy of any applicable purchase or lease agreement
and any other information requested by the executive director to allow the executive director
110TH DAY]                                      THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008                                                             9427

to verify that under the proposed employer change, the new employer does not qualify as a
governmental subdivision under section 353.01, subdivision 6, making the employees ineligible
for continued coverage as active members of the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association.
    (c) Following receipt of a resolution and a determination by the executive director that the new
employer is not a governmental subdivision, the executive director shall direct the consulting actuary
retained under section 356.214 to determine whether the general employees retirement plan of the
Public Employees Retirement Association is expected to receive a net gain if privatization occurs,
by determining whether the actuarial liability of the special benefit coverage provided under this
chapter, if extended to the applicable employees under the privatization, is less than the actuarial gain
otherwise to accrue to the plan. The date of the actuarial calculations used to make this determination
must be within one year of the effective date, as defined in section 353F.02, subdivision 3.
    Subd. 2. Recommendation to legislature. (a) If the actuarial calculations under subdivision
1, paragraph (c), indicate that a net gain to the general employees retirement plan of the Public
Employees Retirement Association is expected due to the privatization, the executive director
shall forward a recommendation and supporting documentation to the chair of the Legislative
Commission on Pensions and Retirement, the chair of the Governmental Operations, Reform,
Technology and Elections Committee of the house of representatives, the chair of the State and
Local Government Operations and Oversight Committee of the senate, and the executive director
of the Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement. The recommendation must be in the
form of an addition to the definition of "medical facility" under section 353F.02, subdivision 4, or to
"other public employing unit" under section 353F.02, subdivision 5, whichever is applicable. The
recommendation must be forwarded to the legislature before January 15 for the recommendation
to be considered in that year's legislative session.
    (b) If a medical facility or other public employing unit listed under section 353F.02, subdivision
4 or 5, fails to privatize within one year of the final enactment date of the legislation adding the entity
to the applicable definition, its inclusion under this chapter is voided, and the executive director shall
include in the proposed legislation under paragraph (a) a recommendation that the applicable entity
be stricken from the definition.
    Subd. 3. Date of application. For any privatization added to this chapter after the effective
date of this section, the first date of coverage is the effective date as defined in section 353F.02,
subdivision 3.
     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective the day following final enactment.

at the compound annual rate of six percent from the date that the amount was deducted from the
retirement annuity to the date of payment.
    (b) The written application must be on a form prescribed by the chief administrative officer of
the applicable retirement plan.
    (c) If the retired member dies before the payment provided for in paragraph (a) is made, the
amount is payable, upon written application, to the deceased person's surviving spouse, or if none,
to the deceased person's designated beneficiary, or if none, to the deceased person's estate.
    (d) In lieu of the direct payment of the person's amount under subdivision 2, on or after the
payment date under paragraph (a), if the federal Internal Revenue Code so permits, the retired
member may elect to have all or any portion of the payment amount under this section paid in
the form of a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c) of the federal
Internal Revenue Code that is specified by the retired member. If the retired member dies with a
balance remaining payable under this section, the surviving spouse of the retired member, or if
none, the deceased person's designated beneficiary, or if none, the administrator of the deceased
person's estate may elect a direct rollover under this paragraph.
      EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective retroactively from January 1, 2008.
      Sec. 31. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 356.551, subdivision 2, is amended to read:
    Subd. 2. Determination. (a) Unless the minimum purchase amount set forth in paragraph (c)
applies, the prior service credit purchase amount is an amount equal to the actuarial present value,
on the date of payment, as calculated by the chief administrative officer of the pension plan and
reviewed by the actuary retained under section 356.214, of the amount of the additional retirement
annuity obtained by the acquisition of the additional service credit in this section.
    (b) Calculation of this amount must be made using the preretirement interest rate applicable to the
public pension plan specified in section 356.215, subdivision 8, and the mortality table adopted for
the public pension plan. The calculation must assume continuous future service in the public pension
plan until, and retirement at, the age at which the minimum requirements of the fund for normal
retirement or retirement with an annuity unreduced for retirement at an early age, including section
356.30, are met with the additional service credit purchased. The calculation must also assume a
full-time equivalent salary, or actual salary, whichever is greater, and a future salary history that
includes annual salary increases at the applicable salary increase rate for the plan specified in section
356.215, subdivision 4d.

following the termination of covered employment, may elect to terminate participation in the
unclassified program and be covered by the general plan by filing a written election with the
executive director. The executive director shall then redeem the employee's total shares and shall
credit to the employee's account in the general plan the amount of contributions that would have
been so credited had the employee been covered by the general plan during the employee's entire
covered employment or elective state service. The balance of money so redeemed and not credited
to the employee's account shall be transferred to the general plan retirement fund, except that (1)
the employee contribution paid to the unclassified program must be compared to (2) the employee
contributions that would have been paid to the general plan for the comparable period, if the
individual had been covered by that plan. If clause (1) is greater than clause (2), the difference must
be refunded to the employee as provided in section 352.22. If clause (2) is greater than clause (1),
the difference must be paid by the employee within six months of electing general plan coverage
or before the effective date of the annuity, whichever is sooner.
   (b) An election under paragraph (a) to transfer coverage to the general plan is irrevocable during

     Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 423A.02, subdivision 1b, is amended to read:
    Subd. 1b. Additional amortization state aid. (a) Annually, on October 1, the commissioner

subdivision 11, to:
    (1) all police or salaried firefighters relief associations governed by and in full compliance with
the requirements of section 69.77, that had an unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the actuarial
valuation prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216 as of the preceding December 31;
    (2) all local police or salaried firefighter consolidation accounts governed by chapter 353A that
are certified by the executive director of the public employees retirement association as having
for the current fiscal year an additional municipal contribution amount under section 353A.09,
subdivision 5, paragraph (b), and that have implemented section 353A.083, subdivision 1, if the
effective date of the consolidation preceded May 24, 1993, and that have implemented section
353A.083, subdivision 2, if the effective date of the consolidation preceded June 1, 1995; and
    (3) the municipalities that are required to make an additional municipal contribution under
section 353.665, subdivision 8, for the duration of the required additional contribution.
    (b) The commissioner shall allocate the state aid on the basis of the proportional share of the relief
association or consolidation account of the total unfunded actuarial accrued liability of all recipient
relief associations and consolidation accounts as of December 31, 1993, for relief associations, and
110TH DAY]                          THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008                                        9439

as of June 30, 1994, for consolidation accounts.
    (c) Beginning October 1, 2000, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall allocate the state
aid, including any state aid in excess of the limitation in subdivision 4, on the following basis:
   (1) 64.5 percent to the municipalities to which section 353.665, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), or
353A.09, subdivision 5, paragraph (b), apply for distribution in accordance with paragraph (b) and
subject to the limitation in subdivision 4;
    (2) 34.2 percent to the city of Minneapolis to fund any unfunded actuarial accrued liability in
the actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216 as of the preceding December
31 for the Minneapolis Police Relief Association or the Minneapolis Fire Department Relief
Association; and
    (3) 1.3 percent to the city of Virginia to fund any unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the
actuarial valuation prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216 as of the preceding December 31
for the Virginia Fire Department Relief Association.
    If there is no unfunded actuarial accrued liability in both the Minneapolis Police Relief
Association and the Minneapolis Fire Department Relief Association as disclosed in the most
recent actuarial valuations for the relief associations prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216,
the commissioner shall allocate that 34.2 percent of the aid as follows: 49 percent to the Teachers
Retirement Association, 21 percent to the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, and
30 percent as additional funding to support minimum fire state aid for volunteer firefighters relief
associations. If there is no unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the Virginia Fire Department
Relief Association as disclosed in the most recent actuarial valuation for the relief association
prepared under sections 356.215 and 356.216, the commissioner shall allocate that 1.3 percent of
the aid as follows: 49 percent to the Teachers Retirement Association, 21 percent to the St. Paul
Teachers Retirement Fund Association, and 30 percent as additional funding to support minimum
fire state aid for volunteer firefighters relief associations. Upon the final payment to municipalities
required by section 353.665, subdivision 8, paragraph (b), or 353A.09, subdivision 5, paragraph
(b), the commissioner shall allocate that 64.5 percent of the aid as follows: 20 percent to the St.
Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, 20 percent to the city of Minneapolis to fund any
unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the actuarial valuation proposed under sections 356.215 and
356.216 as of the preceding December 31 for the Minneapolis Police Relief Association or the
Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association, 20 percent for the city of Duluth to pay for any costs
associated with the police and firefighters pensions, and 40 percent as additional funding to support
minimum fire state aid for volunteer firefighters relief associations. The allocation must be made
by the commissioner at the same time and under the same procedures as specified in subdivision
3. With respect to the St. Paul Teachers Retirement Fund Association, annually, beginning on July
1, 2005, if the applicable teacher's association five-year average time-weighted rate of investment
return does not equal or exceed the performance of a composite portfolio assumed passively
managed (indexed) invested ten percent in cash equivalents, 60 percent in bonds and similar debt
securities, and 30 percent in domestic stock calculated using the formula under section 11A.04,
clause (11), the aid allocation to that retirement fund under this section ceases until the five-year
annual rate of investment return equals or exceeds the performance of that composite portfolio.
    (d) The amounts required under this subdivision are annually appropriated to the commissioner
of revenue.

                          MNSCU-IRAP AND RELATED CHANGES
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354B.20, is amended by adding a subdivision to
read:
    Subd. 19. Unclaimed plan account amounts. "Unclaimed plan account amounts" means the
accounts of any plan participant who has terminated employment by the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities System or who has died, or of the surviving spouse, beneficiary, or estate of the
participant if the plan administrator is unable to locate the applicable recipient in accordance with
Internal Revenue Service due diligence requirements.
   Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354B.25, subdivision 5, is amended to read:
    Subd. 5. Individual retirement account plan administrative expenses. (a) The reasonable and
necessary administrative expenses of the individual retirement account plan may be charged to plan
participants by the plan sponsor in the form of an annual fee, an asset-based fee, a percentage of the
contributions to the plan, or a combination thereof. This amount shall be offset by interest earned
on both the plan reserves and unclaimed funds account.
    (b) Any administrative expense charge that is not actually needed for the administrative expenses
of the individual retirement account plan must be refunded to member accounts.
    (c) The Board of Trustees shall report annually, before October 1, to the advisory committee
created in subdivision 1a on administrative expenses of the plan. The report must include a detailed
accounting of charges for administrative expenses collected from plan participants and expenditure
of the administrative expense charges. The administrative expense charges collected from plan
participants must be kept in a separate account from any other funds under control of the Board
of Trustees and may be used only for the necessary and reasonable administrative expenses of the
plan.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354B.25, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
  Subd. 6. Disposition of abandoned public pension amounts. (a) Any unclaimed plan account
amounts are presumed to be abandoned, but are not subject to the provisions of sections 345.31
110TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2008                                          9441

to 345.60. If the account remains unclaimed after five years following the date that the plan
administrator first attempts to locate the former member, surviving spouse, or other beneficiary,
the unclaimed plan account amount cancels and must be credited to the reserve account specified
in paragraph (b).
    (b) The board must establish a separate account to receive unclaimed plan account amounts.
A portion of this reserve account and any investment earnings attributable to this reserve account
are to be used to offset the reasonable and necessary expenses of the individual retirement account
plan, including costs incurred in efforts to locate lost participants, surviving spouses, or other
beneficiaries.
    (c) If the unclaimed plan account amount exceeded $25 and the inactive member, surviving
spouse, or beneficiary, whichever is applicable, establishes a valid claim to the forfeited account,
the forfeited account is to be reestablished in an amount equal to the amount originally forfeited.
The board must ensure that the reserve account has sufficient assets to cover any transfers needed
to reestablish accounts.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 354C.12, subdivision 4, is amended to read:
    Subd. 4. Administrative expenses. (a) The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges
and Universities is authorized to pay the necessary and reasonable administrative expenses of the
supplemental retirement plan and may bill participants to recover these expenses. The administrative
fees or charges may be charged to participants as an annual fee, an asset-based fee, a percentage of
contributions to the plan, or a contribution thereof. This amount shall be offset by interest earned
on both the plan reserves and unclaimed funds account.
   (b) Any recovered or assessed amounts that are not needed for the necessary and reasonable
administrative expenses of the plan must be refunded to member accounts.
    (c) The Board of Trustees shall report annually, before October 1, to the advisory committee
created in section 354B.25, subdivision 1a, on administrative expenses of the plan. The report
must include a detailed accounting of charges for administrative expenses collected from plan
participants and expenditure of the administrative expense charges. The administrative expense
charges collected from plan participants must be kept in a separate account from any other funds
under control of the Board of Trustees and may be used only for the necessary and reasonable
administrative expenses of the plan.

  Sec. 7. ACTUARIAL IMPACT STUDY; MNSCU-TENURED FACULTY RETIREMENT
PLAN COVERAGE CHANGE.
    (a) The Teachers Retirement Association shall have the actuary retained under Minnesota
Statutes, section 356.214, conduct a study of the likely actuarial impact on the Teachers Retirement
Association of potentially permitting current tenure-track faculty members employed by the
Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System who have not yet attained tenure or its equivalent
to elect retroactive and prospective retirement coverage by the Teachers Retirement Association
within one year of attaining tenure or its equivalent, with the retroactive coverage effected by a
service credit purchase under Minnesota Statutes, section 356.551.
    (b) The actuarial study must include an assessment of the likelihood that tenure-track Minnesota
State Colleges and Universities System faculty members would elect retirement coverage by the
Teachers Retirement Association that underlies any election assumption used in the study based on
the experience of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System faculty members employed
during the most recent ten years. The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System shall
provide the Teachers Retirement Association with the data on its faculty members necessary to
conduct the study.
    (c) The actuarial study must assess the actuarial accrued liability that could be assumed by
the Teachers Retirement Association from potential service credit purchases by Minnesota State
Colleges and Universities System faculty members attaining tenure or its equivalent, the likely
purchase payments related to those potential Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System
faculty member service credit purchases, and the effect on the Teachers Retirement Association
normal cost rate of the potential prospective inclusion of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities
System faculty members upon attaining tenure.
   (d) The report required under this section must be filed with the executive director of the
Legislative Commission on Pensions and Retirement on or before January 15, 2009.

paragraph (c).
    (b) Any actuarial consulting firm retained under paragraph (a) will, according to a schedule

and areas of concern or potential improvement in the specific reports reviewed, the procedures
utilized by any particular reporting actuary, or general modifications to standards, procedures,
or assumptions that the commission may wish to consider. Actuarial firms retained by the
retirement funds must cooperate fully and make available any data or other materials necessary
for the commission-retained actuary to conduct an adequate review and to render advice to the

plan is governed by any other law, between the entry age and the assumed exit age, with the portion
of the actuarial present value which is allocated to the valuation year to be the normal cost and the
portion of the actuarial present value not provided for at the valuation date by the actuarial present
value of future normal costs to be the actuarial accrued liability, with aggregation in the calculation
process to be the sum of the calculated result for each covered individual and with recognition given
to any different benefit formulas which may apply to various periods of service.
   (e) "Experience study" means a report providing experience data and an actuarial analysis of the

assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect before the change;

amortize the difference between the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under
item (i) and the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount calculated under item (iii) over a period
of 30 years from the end of the plan year in which the applicable change is effective must be
calculated using the applicable interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect after any
applicable change;
     (v) the level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution under item (iv) must be
added to the level annual dollar amortization contribution or level percentage calculated under item
(ii);
    (vi) the period in which the unfunded actuarial accrued liability amount determined in item (iii)
is amortized by the total level annual dollar or level percentage amortization contribution computed
under item (v) must be calculated using the interest assumption specified in subdivision 8 in effect
after any applicable change, rounded to the nearest integral number of years, but not to exceed
30 years from the end of the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full
funding using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and not to be less than the period of
years beginning in the plan year in which the determination of the established date for full funding
using the procedure set forth in this clause is made and ending by the date for full funding in effect
before the change; and
   (vii) the period determined under item (vi) must be added to the date as of which the actuarial
valuation was prepared and the date obtained is the new established date for full funding.
   (d) For the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund, the established date for full funding is
June 30, 2020.

    (l) In addition to calculating the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the retirement plan for
financial reporting purposes under paragraphs (a) to (j), the actuarial valuation of the retirement plan
must also include a calculation of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the retirement plan for
purposes of determining the amortization contribution sufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial
liability of the Minnesota Post Retirement Investment Fund. For this exhibit, the calculation must be
the unfunded actuarial accrued liability net of the postretirement adjustment liability funded from

    Subd. 5. State Board of Investment to determine investments. (a) The State Board of
Investment shall determine the investment products to be made available under the plan and may
retain appropriate consulting services to assist in making the selections. At a minimum, the State
Board of Investment shall consider the following:

suited to meet the needs of plan participants;
   (2) the relationship of those benefits and products provided by the financial institution to their
cost;
   (3) the financial strength and stability of the financial institution; and

evaluation, and periodic review processes. All options in subdivision 4 must be presented in an
unbiased manner and in a manner that conforms to rules adopted by the executive director, be
reported on a periodic basis to all participants in the deferred compensation plan, and not be the
subject of unreasonable solicitation of participants in the plan. The State Board of Investment may
charge a proportional share of all costs related to the periodic review to each company currently
under contract and may charge a proportional share of all costs related to soliciting and evaluating
bids to each company selected by the State Board of Investment.
    (c) Under the procedures set forth in the plan document, participants may select the funds or
combination of funds within which to invest and may reallocate those investments as provided in
the plan document and procedures established by the executive director.

   Section 1. [423A.021] DEFINED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.
     Subdivision 1. Pension unit increase. For a salaried firefighters relief association in a city of the
first class with a population greater than 300,000, when the actuarial value of assets of the special
fund first exceeds 110 percent of the actuarial accrued liabilities, according to an annual actuarial
valuation occurring after the effective date of this section and performed in accordance with sections
356.215 and 356.216, each service pensioner, joint survivor annuitant, and surviving spouse member
is entitled to a permanent benefit increase. The revised benefit is an increase of one unit for a service
pensioner, not to exceed 43 units, an increase from 22 to 23 units for a surviving spouse benefit, and
an increase from 42.3 to 43.2 units for unmarried service pensioners. The association shall pay the
increased benefit beginning January 1 of the year following the year for which the valuation was
prepared. If adding an additional unit results in raising total units past the maximum, a partial unit
may be added to reach the maximum. For joint survivor annuities, this subdivision authorizes a
benefit increase actuarially equivalent to one unit.
     Subd. 2. Unit precedence. The additional benefit provided for in subdivision 1 shall take
precedence over any other benefit provided when the fund reaches 110 percent funding. In
preparing the actuarial valuation under sections 356.215 and 356.216, the actuary for the fund shall
first account for the benefit provided in subdivision 1 in determining the plan's funded ratio. No
other benefit payments may be made by the association until the actuarial impact of the benefit
provided for in subdivision 1 has been determined and factored into the funding ratio.
    Subd. 3. Excess investment income. For a salaried firefighters relief association in a city of
the first class with a population greater than 300,000 that no longer is entitled to state general
fund aid pursuant to section 423A.02, the association shall apply any assets that constitute excess
investment income to the payment of a supplemental postretirement benefit to an eligible member
notwithstanding any other limitation of law. Any amount of excess investment income not otherwise
used for the payment of a supplemental postretirement benefit to an eligible member shall be applied
to reduce the municipality's property tax levy to the association in the year following the payment of
the postretirement benefit. A supplemental postretirement benefit is a lump sum payment equal to the
monthly benefit provided to the benefit recipient in the month prior to payment of the supplemental
postretirement benefit. A supplemental postretirement benefit payable under this section is in lieu of
any benefit payable under section 423C.06, subdivision 2. No supplemental postretirement benefit
is payable under this section if a benefit is payable under section 423C.06, subdivision 3.

     EFFECTIVE DATE. This section is effective January 1, 2009.
     Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 424A.02, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Flexible service pension maximums. (a) Annually on or before August 1 as part of
the certification of the financial requirements and minimum municipal obligation determined under
section 69.772, subdivision 4, or 69.773, subdivision 5, as applicable, the secretary or some other
official of the relief association designated in the bylaws of each relief association shall calculate
and certify to the governing body of the applicable qualified municipality the average amount of
available financing per active covered firefighter for the most recent three-year period. The amount
of available financing shall include any amounts of fire state aid received or receivable by the relief
association, any amounts of municipal contributions to the relief association raised from levies on
real estate or from other available revenue sources exclusive of fire state aid, and one-tenth of the
amount of assets in excess of the accrued liabilities of the relief association calculated under section
69.772, subdivision 2; 69.773, subdivisions 2 and 4; or 69.774, subdivision 2, if any.
    (b) The maximum service pension which the relief association has authority to provide for
in its bylaws for payment to a member retiring after the calculation date when the minimum age
and service requirements specified in subdivision 1 are met must be determined using the table in
paragraph (c) or (d), whichever applies.
    (c) For a relief association where the governing bylaws provide for a monthly service pension
to a retiring member, the maximum monthly service pension amount per month for each year of
service credited that may be provided for in the bylaws is the greater of the service pension amount
provided for in the bylaws on the date of the calculation of the average amount of the available
financing per active covered firefighter or the maximum service pension figure corresponding to the
average amount of available financing per active covered firefighter:
           Minimum Average Amount of Available                                     Maximum Service Pension Amount
                 Financing per Firefighter                                         Payable per Month for Each Year

   (e) For a relief association in which the governing bylaws provide for a monthly benefit service
pension as an alternative form of service pension payment to a lump sum service pension, the
maximum service pension amount for each pension payment type must be determined using the
applicable table contained in this subdivision.
    (f) If a relief association establishes a service pension in compliance with the applicable
maximum contained in paragraph (c) or (d) and the minimum average amount of available
financing per active covered firefighter is subsequently reduced because of a reduction in fire
state aid or because of an increase in the number of active firefighters, the relief association may
continue to provide the prior service pension amount specified in its bylaws, but may not increase
the service pension amount until the minimum average amount of available financing per firefighter
under the table in paragraph (c) or (d), whichever applies, permits.
    (g) No relief association is authorized to provide a service pension in an amount greater than
the largest applicable flexible service pension maximum amount even if the amount of available
financing per firefighter is greater than the financing amount associated with the largest applicable
flexible service pension maximum.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 424A.02, subdivision 7, is amended to read:
    Subd. 7. Deferred service pensions. (a) A member of a relief association is entitled to a deferred
service pension if the member:
   (1) has completed the lesser of the minimum period of active service with the fire department
specified in the bylaws or 20 years of active service with the fire department;
   (2) has completed at least five years of active membership in the relief association; and
    (3) separates from active service and membership before reaching age 50 or the minimum age
for retirement and commencement of a service pension specified in the bylaws governing the relief
association if that age is greater than age 50.
    (b) The deferred service pension is payable when the former member reaches age 50, or the
minimum age specified in the bylaws governing the relief association if that age is greater than age
50, and when the former member makes a valid written application.
   (c) A relief association that provides a lump sum service pension governed by subdivision 3 may,

when its governing bylaws so provide, pay interest on the deferred lump sum service pension during
the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, interest must be paid in one of the following
manners:
    (1) at the investment performance rate actually earned on that portion of the assets if the deferred
benefit amount is invested by the relief association in a separate account established and maintained
by the relief association or if the deferred benefit amount is invested in a separate investment vehicle
held by the relief association; or
   (2) at an interest rate of up to five percent, compounded annually, as set by the board of directors
and approved as provided in subdivision 10;    ­­­o­

    (e) A relief association that provides a defined contribution service pension may, if its governing
bylaws so provide, credit interest or additional investment performance on the deferred lump sum
service pension during the period of deferral. If provided for in the bylaws, the interest must be paid
in one of the manners specified in paragraph (c) or alternatively the relief association may credit any
investment return on the assets of the special fund of the defined contribution volunteer firefighter
relief association in proportion to the share of the assets of the special fund to the credit of each
individual deferred member account through the date on which the investment return is recognized
by and credited to the special fund.
    (f) For a deferred service pension that is transferred to a separate account established and
maintained by the relief association or separate investment vehicle held by the relief association, the
deferred member bears the full investment risk subsequent to transfer and in calculating the accrued
liability of the volunteer firefighters relief association that pays a lump sum service pension, the
accrued liability for deferred service pensions is equal to the separate relief association account
balance or the fair market value of the separate investment vehicle held by the relief association.
    (g) The deferred service pension is governed by and must be calculated under the general
statute, special law, relief association articles of incorporation, and relief association bylaw
provisions applicable on the date on which the member separated from active service with the fire
department and active membership in the relief association.

    Subd. 9. Limitation on ancillary benefits. Any relief association, including any volunteer
firefighters relief association governed by section 69.77 or any volunteer firefighters division of a
relief association governed by chapter 424, may only pay ancillary benefits which would constitute
an authorized disbursement as specified in section 424A.05 subject to the following requirements
or limitations:
    (1) with respect to a relief association in which governing bylaws provide for a lump sum service
pension to a retiring member, no ancillary benefit may be paid to any former member or paid to any
person on behalf of any former member after the former member (i) terminates active service with
the fire department and active membership in the relief association; and (ii) commences receipt of
a service pension as authorized under this section; and
    (2) with respect to any relief association, no ancillary benefit paid or payable to any member, to
any former member, or to any person on behalf of any member or former member, may exceed in
amount the total earned service pension of the member or former member. The total earned service
pension must be calculated u    ­­

prescribed by the executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association and upon
compliance with subdivisions 4 and 5, shall have service credit for the period from April 2, 1990,
to January 1, 1996, transferred from the coordinated program of the general employees retirement
plan to the public employees police and fire retirement plan on the first of the month next following
the receipt of the additional payments under subdivision 4.
    (b) Upon the transfer of service credit under paragraph (a), the service credit of the eligible
person in the coordinated program of the general employees retirement plan for the period from
April 2, 1990, to January 1, 1996, is forfeited and may not be subsequently restored under Minnesota
Statutes, section 353.35, or any other applicable provision of law.
    Subd. 4. Additional payment amounts. (a) Accompanying the written application under
subdivision 3, the eligible person shall include an additional member contribution payment for
the period from April 2, 1990, to January 1, 1996. The additional member contribution payment
amount is the difference between the member contribution rate under Minnesota Statutes, section
353.65, subdivision 2, and the member contribution rate under Minnesota Statutes, section 353.27,
subdivision 2, applied to the eligible person's total covered salary for the period from April 2, 1990,

the present value of the eligible person's combined retirement annuity from the coordinated program
of the general employees retirement plan and from the public employees police and fire retirement
plan as of the end of the month preceding the payment of the additional member contribution amount
and the present value of the potential retirement annuity from the public employees police and fire
retirement plan if the service credit transfer occurred as of the same date, reduced by the amount of
the retirement plan asset transfer under paragraph (c) and by the amount of the additional member
contribution amount. The present value computation must be made by the actuary retained under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.214, and must utilize the applicable actuarial assumptions under
Minnesota Statutes, section 356.215. The additional employer contribution amount must be paid in
a lump sum. If the additional employer contribution payment is not made in a timely fashion, the
executive director of the Public Employees Retirement Association shall notify the commissioners
of finance and revenue of that fact and the commissioners shall deduct the required amount from
any state aid or other state payment amount applicable to the city, plus interest on the amount at the
rate of one percent per month from the payment due date to the actual payment date.
    (c) Upon the receipt of the additional member contribution under paragraph (a), the executive
director shall transfer an amount equal to double the eligible person's member contributions to the
coordinated program of the general employees retirement plan for the period from April 2, 1990, to
January 1, 1996, plus compound interest at the annual rate of 8.5 percent from August 1, 1993, to
the date of transfer from the general employees retirement fund to the public employees police and
fire retirement fund.

The Honorable James P. Metzen
President of the Senate
Dear President Metzen:
I have vetoed and am returning Senate File 2919, Chapter 255, a bill relating to civil commitment
hearings.
9522                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [110TH DAY

This legislation was requested by the Minnesota County Attorney Association (MCAA) as the result
of a recent Supreme Court decision. The Court held that a person who is subject to a petition
for civil commitment as a Sexually Dangerous Person (SDP) or Sexual Psychopathic Personality
(SPP) has the right under Minnesota Statutes, Section 253B.08, to demand a hearing be held on the
petition within 15 days of the demand. Although this provision of law is appropriate to most civil
commitment proceedings, the complexity of SDP and SPP civil commitment proceedings makes
trial within the statutory 15 day time period unrealistic.
The bill as introduced would have exempted SDP and SPP civil commitment proceedings from the
statutory requirement to provide a trial within 15 days of a demand, but would have continued to
make SDP and SPP proceedings subject to the regular statutory timeframes for completing a civil
commitment proceeding. Unfortunately, the bill mistakenly exempts SDP and SPP petitions from
all of the trial timeframes in statute, rather than just the 15 day trial by demand provision.
The bill authors now acknowledge this mistake and have requested this bill be vetoed. Language to
properly address these issues has been inserted into the Omnibus Judiciary Policy Bill.
Removing all statutory timeframes for SDP and SPP commitment proceedings is clearly not what
was intended by the MCAA or the Legislature. Accordingly, I am vetoing the bill. I am issuing this
veto with the hope that there is still time in this session for the Legislature to pass legislation that
would correctly address MCAA concerns.
                                                      Sincerely,
                                                      Tim Pawlenty, Governor
   Senator Pogemiller moved that S.F. No. 2919 and the veto message thereon be laid on the table.
The motion prevailed.

    (a) Prior to collecting a sample, persons with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1
must provide parents or legal guardians of infants with a document that provides the following
information:
    (1) the blood sample will be used to test for heritable and congenital disorders, the blood sample
will be retained by the Department of Health for a period of at least two years and that the blood
sample may be used for public health studies and research;
     (2) the data that will be collected as a result of the testing;
    (3) the alternatives available to the parents set forth in paragraph (b) and that a form to exercise
the alternatives is available from the person with a duty to perform testing under subdivision 1;
   (4) the benefits of testing and the consequences of a decision to permit or refuse to supply a
sample;
    (5) the benefits of retaining the blood sample and the consequences of a decision to destroy the
blood sample after two years or to permit or decline to have the blood sample used for public health
studies and research;
   (6) the ways in which the samples and data collected will be stored and used at the Department
of Health and elsewhere; and
  (7) the Department of Health's Web site address where the forms referenced in paragraph (b)
may be obtained.
This document satisfies the requirements of section 13.04, subdivision 2.
   (b) The parent or legal guardian of an infant otherwise subject to testing under this section may
object to any of the following:
     (1) the testing itself;
   (2) the maintenance of the infant's blood samples and test result records for a period longer than
24 months; and
    (3) the use of the infant's blood samples and test result records for public health studies and
research.
If a parent or legal guardian elects one of the alternatives, the election shall be recorded on a form
that is signed by the parent or legal guardian. The signed form shall be made part of the infant's
medical record and shall be provided to the Department of Health. The signature of the parent or
legal guardian is sufficient and no witness to the signature, photo identification, or notarization
shall be required. When a parent or legal guardian elects an alternative under this subdivision, the
Department of Health must follow the election and section 144.128. A written election exempts an
