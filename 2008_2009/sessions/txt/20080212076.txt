continued his education at Harvard University and the University of Chicago; and

economics and mathematics in the School of Business Administration. Hurwicz became chairman
of the Statistics Department in 1961, Regents Professor of Economics in 1969, and Curtis L.

welfare economics, public economics, mechanisms and institutions, and mathematical economics;

understandable concepts; and

professor emeritus until the fall of 2006. He has received honorary doctorates from six different
universities throughout the world; and
