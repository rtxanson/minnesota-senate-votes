a showing of indigency or undue hardship upon the convicted person or the convicted person's
immediate family, the sentencing court may authorize payment of the surcharge in installments.

from work performed in the facility or while on conditional release. The chief executive officer shall
forward the amount collected to the commissioner of finance."
