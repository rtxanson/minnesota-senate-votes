has determined is charity care as defined under Minnesota Rules, part 4650.0115, or for which the
hospital determines after billing for the services that there is a demonstrated inability to pay. Any
costs forgiven under a hospital's community care plan or under section 62J.83 may be counted in
the hospital's calculation of community care. Bad debt expenses and discounted charges available to
the uninsured shall not be included in the calculation of community care. The amount of community
care is the value of costs incurred and not the charges made for services.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.552, is amended to read:
   144.552 PUBLIC INTEREST REVIEW.
   (a) The following entities must submit a plan to the commissioner:
   (1) a hospital seeking to increase its number of licensed beds; or
    (2) an organization seeking to obtain a hospital license and notified by the commissioner under
section 144.553, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), that it is subject to this section.
The plan must include information that includes an explanation of how the expansion will meet
the public's interest. When submitting a plan to the commissioner, an applicant shall pay the
commissioner for the commissioner's cost of reviewing and monitoring the plan, as determined by
the commissioner and notwithstanding section 16A.1283. Money received by the commissioner
under this section is appropriated to the commissioner for the purpose of administering this section.
    (b) Plans submitted under this section shall include detailed information necessary for the
commissioner to review the plan and reach a finding. The commissioner may request additional
information from the hospital submitting a plan under this section and from others affected by the
plan that the commissioner deems necessary to review the plan and make a finding.
    (c) The commissioner shall review the plan and, within 90 days, but no more than six months
if extenuating circumstances apply, issue a finding on whether the plan is in the public interest. In
making the recommendation, the commissioner shall consider issues including but not limited to:
   (1) whether the new hospital or hospital beds are needed to provide timely access to care or
access to new or improved services;
   (2) the financial impact of the new hospital or hospital beds on existing acute-care hospitals that
have emergency departments in the region;
   (3) how the new hospital or hospital beds will affect the ability of existing hospitals in the region
to maintain existing staff;
    (4) the extent to which the new hospital or hospital beds will provide services to nonpaying or
low-income patients relative to the level of services provided to these groups by existing hospitals
in the region; and
   (5) the views of affected parties.
   (d) If the plan is being submitted by an existing hospital seeking authority to construct a new
hospital, the commissioner shall also consider:
   (1) the ability of the applicant to maintain the applicant's current level of community benefit at

the existing facility;
   (2) the impact on the workforce at the existing facility; and
    (3) the commitment of the applicant to provide to the existing workforce the right of first refusal
for jobs the existing workforce is qualified for at the new facility, the applicant's commitment to
retraining and employment security for the existing workforce, and, in the case of layoffs at the
existing facility, the applicant's commitment to severance and other measures to minimize the loss
to these workers.
    (e) Prior to making a recommendation, the commissioner shall conduct a public hearing in the
affected hospital service area to take testimony from interested persons.
   ­
   (d
    ­­) (f) Upon making a recommendation under paragraph (c), the commissioner shall provide a
copy of the recommendation to the chairs of the house and senate committees having jurisdiction
over health and human services policy and finance.
    (g) If an exception to the moratorium is approved under section 144.551 after a review under
this section, the commissioner shall monitor the implementation of the exception until completion
of the construction project to ensure that the project continues to be in the public interest. If the
commissioner determines that the project does not reflect the details of the plan submitted under
this section, the commissioner may refuse to grant the license for the project approved under
section 144.551. Upon completion of the construction project and before the final license approval
is granted, the hospital shall submit to the commissioner a report on how the construction has met
the provisions of the plan originally submitted under the public interest review process.
   Sec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 144.553, subdivision 3, is amended to read:
    Subd. 3. Process when hospital need is determined. (a) If the commissioner determines that
a new hospital is needed in the proposed service area, the commissioner shall notify the applicants
of that finding and shall select the applicant determined under the process established in this
subdivision to be best able to provide services consistent with the review criteria established in this
subdivision.
   (b) The commissioner shall:
  (1) determine market-specific criteria that shall be used to evaluate all proposals. The criteria
must include standards regarding:
   (i) access to care;
   (ii) quality of care;
   (iii) cost of care; and
   (iv) overall project feasibility;
   (2) establish additional criteria at the commissioner's discretion. In establishing the criteria, the
commissioner shall consider the need for:
   (i) mental health services in the service area, including both inpatient and outpatient services for
adults, adolescents, and children;

    (ii) a significant commitment to providing uncompensated care, including discounts for
uninsured patients and coordination with other providers of care to low-income uninsured persons;
and
    (iii) coordination with other hospitals so that specialized services are not unnecessarily
duplicated and are provided in sufficient volume to ensure the maintenance of high-quality care;
and
   (3) define a service area for the proposed hospital. The service area shall consist of:
   (i) in the 11-county metropolitan area, in St. Cloud, and in Duluth, the zip codes located within
a 20-mile radius of the proposed new hospital location; and
   (ii) in the remainder of the state, the zip codes within a 30-mile radius of the proposed new
hospital location.
   (c) If the plan is being submitted by an existing hospital, the commissioner shall also consider:
    (1) the ability of the applicant to maintain the applicant's current level of community benefit at
the existing facility;
   (2) the impact on the workforce at the existing facility; and
    (3) the commitment of the applicant to provide to the existing workforce the right of first refusal
for jobs the existing workforce is qualified for at the new facility, the applicant's commitment to
retraining and employment security for the existing workforce, and, in the case of layoffs at the
existing facility, the applicant's commitment to severance and other measures to minimize the loss
to these workers.

community care, and underpayment for state public health care programs. For purposes of this
subdivision, underpayment for services provided by state public health care programs is the
difference between hospital costs and public program payments. The information shall be reported
in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of total operating costs for each hospital."

    Subdivision 1. General. (a) Except for hearings arising under section 260C.425, hearings on
any matter shall be without a jury and may be conducted in an informal manner. In all adjudicatory
proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services, the court shall admit
only evidence that would be admissible in a civil trial. To be proved at trial, allegations of a petition
alleging a child to be in need of protection or services must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.
     (b) Except for proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and
petitions for the termination of parental rights, hearings may be continued or adjourned from time
to time. In proceedings involving a child alleged to be in need of protection or services and petitions
for the termination of parental rights, hearings may not be continued or adjourned for more than
one week unless the court makes specific findings that the continuance or adjournment is in the best
interests of the child. If a hearing is held on a petition involving physical or sexual abuse of a child
who is alleged to be in need of protection or services or neglected and in foster care, the court shall
file the decision with the court administrator as soon as possible but no later than 15 days after the
matter is submitted to the court. When a continuance or adjournment is ordered in any proceeding,
the court may make any interim orders as it deems in the best interests of the minor in accordance
with the provisions of sections 260C.001 to 260C.421.
   (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the court shall exclude the general public
from hearings under this chapter and shall admit only those persons who, in the discretion of the
court, have a direct interest in the case or in the work of the court.
   (d) Adoption hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of laws relating to
adoptions.
    (e) In any permanency hearing, including the transition of a child from foster care to independent
living, the court shall assure that any consultation with the child is in an age appropriate manner."

    Subdivision 1. Care, examination, or treatment. (a) Except where parental rights are
terminated,
   (1) whenever legal custody of a child is transferred by the court to a responsible social services
agency,

   (2) whenever legal custody is transferred to a person other than the responsible social services
agency, but under the supervision of the responsible social services agency, or
    (3) whenever a child is given physical or mental examinations or treatment under order of the
court, and no provision is otherwise made by law for payment for the care, examination, or treatment
of the child, these costs are a charge upon the welfare funds of the county in which proceedings are
held upon certification of the judge of juvenile court.
    (b) The court shall order, and the responsible social services agency shall require, the parents or
custodian of a child, while the child is under the age of 18, to use the total income and resources
attributable to the child for the period of care, examination, or treatment, except for clothing and
personal needs allowance as provided in section 256B.35, to reimburse the county for the cost of
care, examination, or treatment. Income and resources attributable to the child include, but are not
limited to, Social Security benefits, supplemental security income (SSI), veterans benefits, railroad
retirement benefits and child support. When the child is over the age of 18, and continues to receive
care, examination, or treatment, the court shall order, and the responsible social services agency
shall require, reimbursement from the child for the cost of care, examination, or treatment from
the income and resources attributable to the child less the clothing and personal needs allowance.
Income does not include earnings from a child over 18 who is working as part of a plan under section
260C.212, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), clause (8), to transition from foster care.
    (c) If the income and resources attributable to the child are not enough to reimburse the county
for the full cost of the care, examination, or treatment, the court shall inquire into the ability of the
parents to support the child and, after giving the parents a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the
court shall order, and the responsible social services agency shall require, the parents to contribute
to the cost of care, examination, or treatment of the child. When determining the amount to be
contributed by the parents, the court shall use a fee schedule based upon ability to pay that is
established by the responsible social services agency and approved by the commissioner of human
services. The income of a stepparent who has not adopted a child shall be excluded in calculating
the parental contribution under this section.
    (d) The court shall order the amount of reimbursement attributable to the parents or custodian,
or attributable to the child, or attributable to both sources, withheld under chapter 518A from the
income of the parents or the custodian of the child. A parent or custodian who fails to pay without
good reason may be proceeded against for contempt, or the court may inform the county attorney,
who shall proceed to collect the unpaid sums, or both procedures may be used.
    (e) If the court orders a physical or mental examination for a child, the examination is a medically
necessary service for purposes of determining whether the service is covered by a health insurance
policy, health maintenance contract, or other health coverage plan. Court-ordered treatment shall
be subject to policy, contract, or plan requirements for medical necessity. Nothing in this paragraph
changes or eliminates benefit limits, conditions of coverage, co-payments or deductibles, provider
restrictions, or other requirements in the policy, contract, or plan that relate to coverage of other
medically necessary services."

assessment, the local welfare agency shall notify the parent or guardian of the child of the need
for services to address child safety concerns or significant risk of subsequent child maltreatment.
The local welfare agency and the family may also jointly agree that family support and family
preservation services are needed. Within ten working days of the conclusion of an investigation,
the local welfare agency or agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report shall
notify the parent or guardian of the child, the person determined to be maltreating the child, and if
applicable, the director of the facility, of the determination and a summary of the specific reasons
for the determination. The notice must also include a certification that the information collection
procedures under subdivision 10, paragraphs (h), (i), and (j), were followed and a notice of the
right of a data subject to obtain access to other private data on the subject collected, created, or
maintained under this section. In addition, the notice shall include the length of time that the records

the child who is the subject of the report, and any person or facility determined to have maltreated
a child, of their appeal or review rights under this section or section 256.022. The notice shall also
state that a finding of maltreatment may result in denial of a license application or background

the Department of Human Services under chapter 245A, the Department of Health under chapter
144 or 144A, the Department of Corrections under section 241.021, and from providing services

    Subd. 4. Eligibility conditions. (a) The placing agency shall use the AFDC requirements as
specified in federal law as of July 16, 1996, when determining the child's eligibility for adoption
assistance under title IV-E of the Social Security Act. If the child does not qualify, the placing agency
shall certify a child as eligible for state funded adoption assistance only if the following criteria are
met:
    (1) Due to the child's characteristics or circumstances it would be difficult to provide the child
an adoptive home without adoption assistance.
   (2)(i) A placement agency has made reasonable efforts to place the child for adoption without
1154                                           JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                                     [34TH DAY

adoption assistance, but has been unsuccessful; or
   (ii) the child's licensed foster parents desire to adopt the child and it is determined by the placing
agency that the adoption is in the best interest of the child.
    (3)(i) The child has been a ward of the commissioner, a Minnesota-licensed child-placing
agency, or a tribal social service agency of Minnesota recognized by the Secretary of the Interior;
or (ii) the child will be adopted according to tribal law without a termination of parental rights or
relinquishment, provided that the tribe has documented the valid reason why the child cannot or
should not be returned to the home of the child's parent. The placing agency shall not certify a
child who remains under the jurisdiction of the sending agency pursuant to section 260.851, article
5, for state-funded adoption assistance when Minnesota is the receiving state.
    (b) For purposes of this subdivision, the characteristics or circumstances that may be considered
in determining whether a child is a child with special needs under United States Code, title 42,
chapter 7, subchapter IV, part E, or meets the requirements of paragraph (a), clause (1), are the
following:
    (1) The child is a member of a sibling group to be placed as one unit in which at least one sibling
is older than 15 months of age or is described in clause (2) or (3).
     (2) The child has documented physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disabilities.
     (3) The child has a high risk of developing physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral disabilities.

social services agency makes reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent plan for the
child as provided in paragraph (e). In determining reasonable efforts to be made with respect to a
child and in making those reasonable efforts, the child's best interests, health, and safety must be of
paramount concern. Reasonable efforts to prevent placement and for rehabilitation and reunification
are always required except upon a determination by the court that a petition has been filed stating a
prima facie case that:
34TH DAY]                           THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2007                                        1155

       (1) the parent has subjected a child to egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision
14;
       (2) the parental rights of the parent to another child have been terminated involuntarily;
       (3) the child is an abandoned infant under section 260C.301, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), clause
(2);
    (4) the parent's custodial rights to another child have been involuntarily transferred to a relative
under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, paragraph (e), clause (1), or a similar law of another
jurisdiction; or
    (5) the provision of services or further services for the purpose of reunification is futile and
therefore unreasonable under the circumstances.
    (b) When the court makes one of the prima facie determinations under paragraph (a), either
permanency pleadings under section 260C.201, subdivision 11, or a termination of parental rights
petition under sections 260C.141 and 260C.301 must be filed. A permanency hearing under section
260C.201, subdivision 11, must be held within 30 days of this determination.
    (c) In the case of an Indian child, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178,
260C.201, and 260C.301 the juvenile court must make findings and conclusions consistent with
the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United States Code, title 25, section 1901 et seq., as to the
provision of active efforts. In cases governed by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, United
States Code, title 25, section 1901, the responsible social services agency must provide active
efforts as required under United States Code, title 25, section 1911(d).
       (d) "Reasonable efforts to prevent placement" means:
       (1) the agency has made reasonable efforts to prevent the placement of the child in foster care;
or
    (2) given the particular circumstances of the child and family at the time of the child's removal,
there are no services or efforts available which could allow the child to safely remain in the home.
    (e) "Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanent plan for the child" means due diligence by the
responsible social services agency to:
       (1) reunify the child with the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed;
    (2) assess a noncustodial parent's ability to provide day-to-day care for the child and, where
appropriate, provide services necessary to enable the noncustodial parent to safely provide the care,
as required by section 260C.212, subdivision 4;
       (3) conduct a relative search as required under section 260C.212, subdivision 5; and
   (4) when the child cannot return to the parent or guardian from whom the child was removed, to
plan for and finalize a safe and legally permanent alternative home for the child, preferably through
adoption or transfer of permanent legal and physical custody of the child.
    (f) Reasonable efforts are made upon the exercise of due diligence by the responsible social
services agency to use culturally appropriate and available services to meet the needs of the child and
1156                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                  [34TH DAY

the child's family. Services may include those provided by the responsible social services agency and
other culturally appropriate services available in the community. At each stage of the proceedings
where the court is required to review the appropriateness of the responsible social services agency's
reasonable efforts as described in paragraphs (a), (d), and (e), the social services agency has the
burden of demonstrating that:
   (1) it has made reasonable efforts to prevent placement of the child in foster care;
   (2) it has made reasonable efforts to eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's
home and to reunify the child with the child's family at the earliest possible time;
   (3) it has made reasonable efforts to finalize an alternative permanent home for the child; or
    (4) reasonable efforts to prevent placement and to reunify the child with the parent or guardian
are not required. The agency may meet this burden by stating facts in a sworn petition filed under
section 260C.141, by filing an affidavit summarizing the agency's reasonable efforts or facts the
agency believes demonstrate there is no need for reasonable efforts to reunify the parent and child,
or through testimony or a certified report required under juvenile court rules.
    (g) Once the court determines that reasonable efforts for reunification are not required because
the court has made one of the prima facie determinations under paragraph (a), the court may only
require reasonable efforts for reunification after a hearing according to section 260C.163, where the
court finds there is not clear and convincing evidence of the facts upon which the court based its
prima facie determination. In this case when there is clear and convincing evidence that the child
is in need of protection or services, the court may find the child in need of protection or services
and order any of the dispositions available under section 260C.201, subdivision 1. Reunification of
a surviving child with a parent is not required if the parent has been convicted of:
   (1) a violation of, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violation of, sections 609.185 to
609.20; 609.222, subdivision 2; or 609.223 in regard to another child of the parent;
   (2) a violation of section 609.222, subdivision 2; or 609.223, in regard to the surviving child; or
    (3) a violation of, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit a violation of, United States Code, title
18, section 1111(a) or 1112(a), in regard to another child of the parent.
    (h) The juvenile court, in proceedings under sections 260B.178 or 260C.178, 260C.201, and
260C.301 shall make findings and conclusions as to the provision of reasonable efforts. When
determining whether reasonable efforts have been made, the court shall consider whether services
to the child and family were:
   (1) relevant to the safety and protection of the child;
   (2) adequate to meet the needs of the child and family;
   (3) culturally appropriate;
   (4) available and accessible;
   (5) consistent and timely; and
   (6) realistic under the circumstances.
34TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2007                                       1157

    In the alternative, the court may determine that provision of services or further services for
the purpose of rehabilitation is futile and therefore unreasonable under the circumstances or that
reasonable efforts are not required as provided in paragraph (a).
    (i) This section does not prevent out-of-home placement for treatment of a child with a
mental disability when the child's diagnostic assessment or individual treatment plan indicates
that appropriate and necessary treatment cannot be effectively provided outside of a residential or
inpatient treatment program.
    (j) If continuation of reasonable efforts to prevent placement or reunify the child with the parent
or guardian from whom the child was removed is determined by the court to be inconsistent with
the permanent plan for the child or upon the court making one of the prima facie determinations
under paragraph (a), reasonable efforts must be made to place the child in a timely manner in a safe
and permanent home and to complete whatever steps are necessary to legally finalize the permanent
placement of the child.
    (k) Reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption or in another permanent placement may
be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to prevent placement or to reunify the child with the
parent or guardian from whom the child was removed. When the responsible social services agency
decides to concurrently make reasonable efforts for both reunification and permanent placement
away from the parent under paragraph (a), the agency shall disclose its decision and both plans for
concurrent reasonable efforts to all parties and the court. When the agency discloses its decision to
proceed on both plans for reunification and permanent placement away from the parent, the court's
review of the agency's reasonable efforts shall include the agency's efforts under both plans.
   Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 260B.157, subdivision 1, is amended to read:
    Subdivision 1. Investigation. Upon request of the court the local social services agency or
probation officer shall investigate the personal and family history and environment of any minor
coming within the jurisdiction of the court under section 260B.101 and shall report its findings to
the court. The court may order any minor coming within its jurisdiction to be examined by a duly
qualified physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by the court.
    The court shall ­h­av
                        ­­e order a chemical use assessment conducted when a child is (1) found to
be delinquent for violating a provision of chapter 152, or for committing a felony-level violation
of a provision of chapter 609 if the probation officer determines that alcohol or drug use was a
contributing factor in the commission of the offense, or (2) alleged to be delinquent for violating a
provision of chapter 152, if the child is being held in custody under a detention order. The assessor's
qualifications and the assessment criteria shall comply with Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655. If funds under chapter 254B are to be used to pay for the recommended treatment, the
assessment and placement must comply with all provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts 9530.6600 to
9530.6655 and 9530.7000 to 9530.7030. The commissioner of human services shall reimburse the
court for the cost of the chemical use assessment, up to a maximum of $100.
    The court shall h
                    ­­av
                       ­­e order a children's mental health screening conducted when a child is found
to be delinquent. The screening shall be conducted with a screening instrument approved by the
commissioner of human services and shall be conducted by a mental health practitioner as defined
in section 245.4871, subdivision 26, or a probation officer who is trained in the use of the screening
instrument. If the screening indicates a need for assessment, the local social services agency, in
consultation with the child's family, shall have a diagnostic assessment conducted, including a
1158                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [34TH DAY

functional assessment, as defined in section 245.4871.
    With the consent of the commissioner of corrections and agreement of the county to pay the
costs thereof, the court may, by order, place a minor coming within its jurisdiction in an institution
maintained by the commissioner for the detention, diagnosis, custody and treatment of persons

unless the specific content indicates otherwise:

child maltreatment, and family strengths and needs that is applied to a child maltreatment report that
does not allege substantial child endangerment. Family assessment does not include a determination
as to whether child maltreatment occurred but does determine the need for services to address the
safety of family members and the risk of subsequent maltreatment.
    (b) "Investigation" means fact gathering related to the current safety of a child and the risk of
subsequent maltreatment that determines whether child maltreatment occurred and whether child
protective services are needed. An investigation must be used when reports involve substantial
child endangerment, and for reports of maltreatment in facilities required to be licensed under
chapter 245A or 245B; under sections 144.50 to 144.58 and 241.021; in a school as defined in
sections 120A.05, subdivisions 9, 11, and 13, and 124D.10; or in a nonlicensed personal care

case of sexual abuse also includes a person who has a significant relationship to the child as defined
in section 609.341, or a person in a position of authority as defined in section 609.341, who by act
or omission commits or attempts to commit an act against a child under their care that constitutes

    (d) "Sexual abuse" means the subjection of a child by a person responsible for the child's care,
by a person who has a significant relationship to the child, as defined in section 609.341, or by a
person in a position of authority, as defined in section 609.341, subdivision 10, to any act which

   (4) failure to ensure that the child is educated as defined in sections 120A.22 and 260C.163,

depends upon spiritual means or prayer for treatment or care of disease or remedial care of the child
in lieu of medical care; except that a parent, guardian, or caretaker, or a person mandated to report
pursuant to subdivision 3, has a duty to report if a lack of medical care may cause serious danger

provide that care;

functioning of the child which may be demonstrated by a substantial and observable effect in the
child's behavior, emotional response, or cognition that is not within the normal range for the child's
age and stage of development, with due regard to the child's culture.
    (g) "Physical abuse" means any physical injury, mental injury, or threatened injury, inflicted by a
person responsible for the child's care on a child other than by accidental means, or any physical or

    The police department or the county sheriff, upon receiving a report, shall immediately notify
the local welfare agency or agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report, orally
and in writing. The local welfare agency, or agency responsible for assessing or investigating the
report, upon receiving a report, shall immediately notify the local police department or the county
sheriff orally and in writing. The county sheriff and the head of every local welfare agency, agency
responsible for assessing or investigating reports, and police department shall each designate
a person within their agency, department, or office who is responsible for ensuring that the
notification duties of this paragraph and paragraph (b) are carried out. Nothing in this subdivision
shall be construed to require more than one report from any institution, facility, school, or agency.
    (b) Any person may voluntarily report to the local welfare agency, agency responsible for
assessing or investigating the report, police department, or the county sheriff if the person knows,
has reason to believe, or suspects a child is being or has been neglected or subjected to physical
or sexual abuse. The police department or the county sheriff, upon receiving a report, shall

from a licensing entity.
    (d) Any person mandated to report shall receive a summary of the disposition of any report made

event longer than 24 hours.
   Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
    Subd. 10. Duties of local welfare agency and local law enforcement agency upon receipt of
a report. (a) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall determine whether to conduct
a family assessment or an investigation as appropriate to prevent or provide a remedy for child
maltreatment. The local welfare agency:
   (1) shall conduct an investigation on reports involving substantial child endangerment;
    (2) shall begin an immediate investigation if, at any time when it is using a family assessment
response, it determines that there is reason to believe that substantial child endangerment or a serious
threat to the child's safety exists;
   (3) may conduct a family assessment for reports that do not allege substantial child
endangerment. In determining that a family assessment is appropriate, the local welfare agency may
consider issues of child safety, parental cooperation, and the need for an immediate response; and
   (4) may conduct a family assessment on a report that was initially screened and assigned for an
investigation. In determining that a complete investigation is not required, the local welfare agency
must document the reason for terminating the investigation and notify the local law enforcement
agency if the local law enforcement agency is conducting a joint investigation.
    If the report alleges neglect, physical abuse, or sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, or individual
functioning within the family unit as a person responsible for the child's care, the local welfare
agency shall immediately conduct a family assessment or investigation as identified in clauses (1)
to (4). In conducting a family assessment or investigation, the local welfare agency shall gather
information on the existence of substance abuse and domestic violence and offer services for
purposes of preventing future child maltreatment, safeguarding and enhancing the welfare of the
abused or neglected minor, and supporting and preserving family life whenever possible. If the
report alleges a violation of a criminal statute involving sexual abuse, physical abuse, or neglect or
endangerment, under section 609.378, the local law enforcement agency and local welfare agency
shall coordinate the planning and execution of their respective investigation and assessment efforts
to avoid a duplication of fact-finding efforts and multiple interviews. Each agency shall prepare a
separate report of the results of its investigation. In cases of alleged child maltreatment resulting in
death, the local agency may rely on the fact-finding efforts of a law enforcement investigation to
make a determination of whether or not maltreatment occurred. When necessary the local welfare
agency shall seek authority to remove the child from the custody of a parent, guardian, or adult
with whom the child is living. In performing any of these duties, the local welfare agency shall
1164                                JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                    [34TH DAY

maintain appropriate records.
   If the family assessment or investigation indicates there is a potential for abuse of alcohol or other
drugs by the parent, guardian, or person responsible for the child's care, the local welfare agency shall
conduct a chemical use assessment pursuant to Minnesota Rules, part 9530.6615. The local welfare
agency shall report the determination of the chemical use assessment, and the recommendations
and referrals for alcohol and other drug treatment services to the state authority on alcohol and drug
abuse.
    (b) When a local agency receives a report or otherwise has information indicating that a child
who is a client, as defined in section 245.91, has been the subject of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or
neglect at an agency, facility, or program as defined in section 245.91, it shall, in addition to its other
duties under this section, immediately inform the ombudsman established under sections 245.91 to
245.97. The commissioner of education shall inform the ombudsman established under sections
245.91 to 245.97 of reports regarding a child defined as a client in section 245.91 that maltreatment
occurred at a school as defined in sections 120A.05, subdivisions 9, 11, and 13, and 124D.10.
    (c) Authority of the local welfare agency responsible for assessing or investigating the child
abuse or neglect report, the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report, and of the
local law enforcement agency for investigating the alleged abuse or neglect includes, but is not
limited to, authority to interview, without parental consent, the alleged victim and any other minors
who currently reside with or who have resided with the alleged offender. The interview may take
place at school or at any facility or other place where the alleged victim or other minors might be
found or the child may be transported to, and the interview conducted at, a place appropriate for
the interview of a child designated by the local welfare agency or law enforcement agency. The
interview may take place outside the presence of the alleged offender or parent, legal custodian,
guardian, or school official. For family assessments, it is the preferred practice to request a parent
or guardian's permission to interview the child prior to conducting the child interview, unless doing
so would compromise the safety assessment. Except as provided in this paragraph, the parent,
legal custodian, or guardian shall be notified by the responsible local welfare or law enforcement
agency no later than the conclusion of the investigation or assessment that this interview has
occurred. Notwithstanding rule 4  ­9­­0
                                     .­ 2
                                        ­ 32 of the Minnesota Rules of Procedure for Juvenile Courts,
the juvenile court may, after hearing on an ex parte motion by the local welfare agency, order that,
where reasonable cause exists, the agency withhold notification of this interview from the parent,
legal custodian, or guardian. If the interview took place or is to take place on school property, the
order shall specify that school officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian
the contents of the notification of intent to interview the child on school property, as provided under
this paragraph, and any other related information regarding the interview that may be a part of the
child's school record. A copy of the order shall be sent by the local welfare or law enforcement
agency to the appropriate school official.
    (d) When the local welfare, local law enforcement agency, or the agency responsible for
assessing or investigating a report of maltreatment determines that an interview should take place
on school property, written notification of intent to interview the child on school property must be
received by school officials prior to the interview. The notification shall include the name of the
child to be interviewed, the purpose of the interview, and a reference to the statutory authority to
conduct an interview on school property. For interviews conducted by the local welfare agency, the
notification shall be signed by the chair of the local social services agency or the chair's designee.
34TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2007                                       1165

The notification shall be private data on individuals subject to the provisions of this paragraph.
School officials may not disclose to the parent, legal custodian, or guardian the contents of the
notification or any other related information regarding the interview until notified in writing by the
local welfare or law enforcement agency that the investigation or assessment has been concluded,
unless a school employee or agent is alleged to have maltreated the child. Until that time, the
local welfare or law enforcement agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating
a report of maltreatment shall be solely responsible for any disclosures regarding the nature of the
assessment or investigation.
    Except where the alleged offender is believed to be a school official or employee, the time and
place, and manner of the interview on school premises shall be within the discretion of school
officials, but the local welfare or law enforcement agency shall have the exclusive authority to
determine who may attend the interview. The conditions as to time, place, and manner of the
interview set by the school officials shall be reasonable and the interview shall be conducted not
more than 24 hours after the receipt of the notification unless another time is considered necessary
by agreement between the school officials and the local welfare or law enforcement agency. Where
the school fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph, the juvenile court may order the
school to comply. Every effort must be made to reduce the disruption of the educational program
of the child, other students, or school staff when an interview is conducted on school premises.
    (e) Where the alleged offender or a person responsible for the care of the alleged victim or other
minor prevents access to the victim or other minor by the local welfare agency, the juvenile court
may order the parents, legal custodian, or guardian to produce the alleged victim or other minor for
questioning by the local welfare agency or the local law enforcement agency outside the presence
of the alleged offender or any person responsible for the child's care at reasonable places and times
as specified by court order.
    (f) Before making an order under paragraph (e), the court shall issue an order to show cause,
either upon its own motion or upon a verified petition, specifying the basis for the requested
interviews and fixing the time and place of the hearing. The order to show cause shall be served
personally and shall be heard in the same manner as provided in other cases in the juvenile court.
The court shall consider the need for appointment of a guardian ad litem to protect the best interests
of the child. If appointed, the guardian ad litem shall be present at the hearing on the order to show
cause.
    (g) The commissioner of human services, the ombudsman for mental health and developmental
disabilities, the local welfare agencies responsible for investigating reports, the commissioner of
education, and the local law enforcement agencies have the right to enter facilities as defined in
subdivision 2 and to inspect and copy the facility's records, including medical records, as part of the
investigation. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 13, they also have the right to inform the
facility under investigation that they are conducting an investigation, to disclose to the facility the
names of the individuals under investigation for abusing or neglecting a child, and to provide the
facility with a copy of the report and the investigative findings.
   (h) The local welfare agency responsible for conducting a family assessment shall collect
available and relevant information to determine child safety, risk of subsequent child maltreatment,
and family strengths and needs. The local welfare agency or the agency responsible for investigating
the report shall collect available and relevant information to ascertain whether maltreatment
occurred and whether protective services are needed. Information collected includes, when
1166                               JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                   [34TH DAY

relevant, information with regard to the person reporting the alleged maltreatment, including the
nature of the reporter's relationship to the child and to the alleged offender, and the basis of the
reporter's knowledge for the report; the child allegedly being maltreated; the alleged offender; the
child's caretaker; and other collateral sources having relevant information related to the alleged
maltreatment. The local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the
report may make a determination of no maltreatment early in an assessment, and close the case and
retain immunity, if the collected information shows no basis for a full assessment or investigation.
   Information relevant to the assessment or investigation must be asked for, and may include:
    (1) the child's sex and age, prior reports of maltreatment, information relating to developmental
functioning, credibility of the child's statement, and whether the information provided under
this clause is consistent with other information collected during the course of the assessment or
investigation;
    (2) the alleged offender's age, a record check for prior reports of maltreatment, and criminal
charges and convictions. The local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing
or investigating the report must provide the alleged offender with an opportunity to make a
statement. The alleged offender may submit supporting documentation relevant to the assessment
or investigation;
    (3) collateral source information regarding the alleged maltreatment and care of the child.
Collateral information includes, when relevant: (i) a medical examination of the child; (ii) prior
medical records relating to the alleged maltreatment or the care of the child maintained by any
facility, clinic, or health care professional and an interview with the treating professionals; and (iii)
interviews with the child's caretakers, including the child's parent, guardian, foster parent, child
care provider, teachers, counselors, family members, relatives, and other persons who may have
knowledge regarding the alleged maltreatment and the care of the child; and
   (4) information on the existence of domestic abuse and violence in the home of the child, and
substance abuse.
    Nothing in this paragraph precludes the local welfare agency, the local law enforcement agency,
or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report from collecting other relevant
information necessary to conduct the assessment or investigation. Notwithstanding section 13.384
or 144.335, the local welfare agency has access to medical data and records for purposes of clause
(3). Notwithstanding the data's classification in the possession of any other agency, data acquired by
the local welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report during
the course of the assessment or investigation are private data on individuals and must be maintained
in accordance with subdivision 11. Data of the commissioner of education collected or maintained
during and for the purpose of an investigation of alleged maltreatment in a school are governed
by this section, notwithstanding the data's classification as educational, licensing, or personnel data
under chapter 13.
    In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in subdivision
2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect investigative reports and data that are
relevant to a report of maltreatment and are from local law enforcement and the school facility.
    (i) Upon receipt of a report, the local welfare agency shall conduct a face-to-face contact with
the child reported to be maltreated and with the child's primary caregiver sufficient to complete a

safety assessment and ensure the immediate safety of the child. The face-to-face contact with the
child and primary caregiver shall occur immediately if substantial child endangerment is alleged and
within five calendar days for all other reports. If the alleged offender was not already interviewed
as the primary caregiver, the local welfare agency shall also conduct a face-to-face interview with
the alleged offender in the early stages of the assessment or investigation. At the initial contact, the
local child welfare agency or the agency responsible for assessing or investigating the report must
inform the alleged offender of the complaints or allegations made against the individual in a manner
consistent with laws protecting the rights of the person who made the report. The interview with the
alleged offender may be postponed if it would jeopardize an active law enforcement investigation.
    (j) When conducting an investigation, the local welfare agency shall use a question and answer
interviewing format with questioning as nondirective as possible to elicit spontaneous responses.
For investigations only, the following interviewing methods and procedures must be used whenever
possible when collecting information:
   (1) audio recordings of all interviews with witnesses and collateral sources; and
    (2) in cases of alleged sexual abuse, audio-video recordings of each interview with the alleged
victim and child witnesses.
    (k) In conducting an assessment or investigation involving a school facility as defined in
subdivision 2, paragraph (i), the commissioner of education shall collect available and relevant
information and use the procedures in paragraphs (i), (k), and subdivision 3d, except that the
requirement for face-to-face observation of the child and face-to-face interview of the alleged
offender is to occur in the initial stages of the assessment or investigation provided that the
commissioner may also base the assessment or investigation on investigative reports and data
received from the school facility and local law enforcement, to the extent those investigations
satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (i) and (k), and subdivision 3d.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 626.556, subdivision 10c, is amended to read:
     Subd. 10c. Duties of local social service agency upon receipt of a report of medical neglect.
If the report alleges medical neglect as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 4 ­ 6, clause (5), the
local welfare agency shall, in addition to its other duties under this section, immediately consult
with designated hospital staff and with the parents of the infant to verify that appropriate nutrition,
hydration, and medication are being provided; and shall immediately secure an independent
medical review of the infant's medical charts and records and, if necessary, seek a court order for an
independent medical examination of the infant. If the review or examination leads to a conclusion
of medical neglect, the agency shall intervene on behalf of the infant by initiating legal proceedings
under section 260C.141 and by filing an expedited motion to prevent the withholding of medically
indicated treatment.

                                       CONTINUING CARE
   Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 256B.69, subdivision 23, is amended to read:
   Subd. 23. Alternative services; elderly and disabled persons. (a) The commissioner may
implement demonstration projects to create alternative integrated delivery systems for acute and
long-term care services to elderly persons and persons with disabilities as defined in section
1168                              JOURNAL OF THE SENATE                                 [34TH DAY

256B.77, subdivision 7a, that provide increased coordination, improve access to quality services,
and mitigate future cost increases. The commissioner may seek federal authority to combine
Medicare and Medicaid capitation payments for the purpose of such demonstrations and may
contract with Medicare-approved special needs plans to provide Medicaid services. Medicare
funds and services shall be administered according to the terms and conditions of the federal
contract and demonstration provisions. For the purpose of administering medical assistance funds,
demonstrations under this subdivision are subject to subdivisions 1 to 22. The provisions of
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464, apply to these demonstrations, with the exceptions
of parts 9500.1452, subpart 2, item B; and 9500.1457, subpart 1, items B and C, which do not apply
to persons enrolling in demonstrations under this section. An initial open enrollment period may
be provided. Persons who disenroll from demonstrations under this subdivision remain subject to
Minnesota Rules, parts 9500.1450 to 9500.1464. When a person is enrolled in a health plan under
these demonstrations and the health plan's participation is subsequently terminated for any reason,
the person shall be provided an opportunity to select a new health plan and shall have the right
to change health plans within the first 60 days of enrollment in the second health plan. Persons
required to participate in health plans under this section who fail to make a choice of health plan
shall not be randomly assigned to health plans under these demonstrations. Notwithstanding section
256L.12, subdivision 5, and Minnesota Rules, part 9505.5220, subpart 1, item A, if adopted, for the
purpose of demonstrations under this subdivision, the commissioner may contract with managed
care organizations, including counties, to serve only elderly persons eligible for medical assistance,
elderly and disabled persons, or disabled persons only. For persons with a primary diagnosis of
developmental disability, serious and persistent mental illness, or serious emotional disturbance,
the commissioner must ensure that the county authority has approved the demonstration and
contracting design. Enrollment in these projects for persons with disabilities shall be voluntary. The
commissioner shall not implement any demonstration project under this subdivision for persons
with a primary diagnosis of developmental disabilities, serious and persistent mental illness, or
serious emotional disturbance, without approval of the county board of the county in which the
demonstration is being implemented.
    (b) Notwithstanding chapter 245B, sections 252.40 to 252.46, 256B.092, 256B.501 to
256B.5015, and Minnesota Rules, parts 9525.0004 to 9525.0036, 9525.1200 to 9525.1330,
9525.1580, and 9525.1800 to 9525.1930, the commissioner may implement under this section
projects for persons with developmental disabilities. The commissioner may capitate payments for
ICF/MR services, waivered services for developmental disabilities, including case management
services, day training and habilitation and alternative active treatment services, and other services
as approved by the state and by the federal government. Case management and active treatment
must be individualized and developed in accordance with a person-centered plan. Costs under these
projects may not exceed costs that would have been incurred under fee-for-service. Beginning
July 1, 2003, and until ­wt­­
                            o four years after the pilot project implementation date, subcontractor
participation in the long-term care developmental disability pilot is limited to a nonprofit long-term
care system providing ICF/MR services, home and community-based waiver services, and
in-home services to no more than 120 consumers with developmental disabilities in Carver,
Hennepin, and Scott Counties. The commissioner shall report to the legislature prior to expansion
of the developmental disability pilot project. This paragraph expires ­w    t­o­ four years after the
implementation date of the pilot project.
  (c) Before implementation of a demonstration project for disabled persons, the commissioner
must provide information to appropriate committees of the house of representatives and senate and
34TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2007                                       1169

must involve representatives of affected disability groups in the design of the demonstration projects.
   (d) A nursing facility reimbursed under the alternative reimbursement methodology in section
256B.434 may, in collaboration with a hospital, clinic, or other health care entity provide services
under paragraph (a). The commissioner shall amend the state plan and seek any federal waivers
necessary to implement this paragraph.
    (e) The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioners of commerce and health, may
approve and implement programs for all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE) according to federal
laws and regulations governing that program and state laws or rules applicable to participating
providers. The process for approval of these programs shall begin only after the commissioner
receives grant money in an amount sufficient to cover the state share of the administrative and
actuarial costs to implement the programs during state fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Grant amounts
for this purpose shall be deposited in an account in the special revenue fund and are appropriated
to the commissioner to be used solely for the purpose of PACE administrative and actuarial costs.
A PACE provider is not required to be licensed or certified as a health plan company as defined in
section 62Q.01, subdivision 4. Persons age 55 and older who have been screened by the county and
found to be eligible for services under the elderly waiver or community alternatives for disabled
individuals or who are already eligible for Medicaid but meet level of care criteria for receipt of
waiver services may choose to enroll in the PACE program. Medicare and Medicaid services will be
provided according to this subdivision and federal Medicare and Medicaid requirements governing
PACE providers and programs. PACE enrollees will receive Medicaid home and community-based
services through the PACE provider as an alternative to services for which they would otherwise be
eligible through home and community-based waiver programs and Medicaid State Plan Services.
The commissioner shall establish Medicaid rates for PACE providers that do not exceed costs that
would have been incurred under fee-for-service or other relevant managed care programs operated
by the state.
    (f) The commissioner shall seek federal approval to expand the Minnesota disability health
options (MnDHO) program established under this subdivision in stages, first to regional population
centers outside the seven-county metro area and then to all areas of the state. Until January 1,
2008, expansion for MnDHO projects that include home and community-based services is limited
to the two projects and service areas in effect on March 1, 2006. Enrollment in integrated MnDHO
programs that include home and community-based services shall remain voluntary. Costs for home
and community-based services included under MnDHO must not exceed costs that would have been
incurred under the fee-for-service program. In developing program specifications for expansion of
integrated programs, the commissioner shall involve and consult the state-level stakeholder group
established in subdivision 28, paragraph (d), including consultation on whether and how to include
home and community-based waiver programs. Plans for further expansion of MnDHO projects shall
be presented to the chairs of the house and senate committees with jurisdiction over health and
human services policy and finance by February 1, 2007.
    (g) Notwithstanding section 256B.0261, health plans providing services under this section are
responsible for home care targeted case management and relocation targeted case management.
Services must be provided according to the terms of the waivers and contracts approved by the
federal government."

funds for any purpose other than that for which they are received;

foreclosure;

58.14 or fail to abide by the affirmations made on the application for licensure;
   (17) represent that the licensee or exempt person is acting as the borrower's agent after
providing the nonagency disclosure required by section 58.15, unless the disclosure is retracted
and the licensee or exempt person complies with all of the requirements of section 58.16;
     (18) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan that is of a lower investment grade
if the borrower's credit score or, if the originator does not utilize credit scoring or if a credit score
is unavailable, then comparable underwriting data, indicates that the borrower may qualify for a
residential mortgage loan, available from or through the originator, that is of a higher investment
grade, unless the borrower is informed that the borrower may qualify for a higher investment grade
loan with a lower interest rate and/or lower discount points, and consents in writing to receipt of the
lower investment grade loan.
     For purposes of this section, "investment grade" refers to a system of categorizing residential
mortgage loans in which the loans are: (i) commonly referred to as "prime" or "subprime"; (ii)
commonly designated by an alphabetical character with "A" being the highest investment grade; and
(iii) are distinguished by interest rate or discount points or both charged to the borrower, which vary
according to the degree of perceived risk of default based on factors such as the borrower's credit,
including credit score and credit patterns, income and employment history, debt ratio, loan-to-value
ratio, and prior bankruptcy or foreclosure;
    (19) make, publish, disseminate, circulate, place before the public, or cause to be made,
directly or indirectly, any advertisement or marketing materials of any type, or any statement or

person on the date advertised, or on the date specified in the advertisement. For purposes of this

interest rates, discount points, and closing costs provided by licensees or exempt persons to a print
or electronic medium that presents the information to the public;
    (21) use or employ phrases, pictures, return addresses, geographic designations, or other means
that create the impression, directly or indirectly, that a licensee or other person is a governmental
agency, or is associated with, sponsored by, or in any manner connected to, related to, or endorsed
by a governmental agency, if that is not the case; ­ o­

    (23) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan without verifying the borrower's
reasonable ability to pay the principal and interest on the loan, and pay real estate taxes and home
insurance. For loans in which the interest rate may vary, the reasonable ability to pay must be
determined based on the maximum monthly payment that could be due during the first five years
of the loan term, which amount must be calculated with reference to the maximum interest rate
allowable under the loan assuming no default by the borrower and assuming a fully indexed rate and
a repayment schedule which achieves full amortization over the life of the loan. For all residential
mortgage loans, the borrower's income and financial resources must be verified by tax returns,
payroll receipts, bank records, or other similarly reliable documents. A statement by the borrower
to the residential mortgage originator or exempt person of the borrower's income and resources is
34TH DAY]                         THURSDAY, MARCH 22, 2007                                         1173

not sufficient to establish the existence of the income or resources when verifying the reasonable
ability to pay;
    (24) whenever the residential mortgage originator informs a borrower, orally or in writing, of
the anticipated or actual periodic payment amount for a first-lien residential mortgage loan, the
residential mortgage originator must inform the borrower that an additional amount will be due
for taxes and insurance and, if known, disclose to the borrower the amount of the anticipated or
actual periodic escrow payments. A residential mortgage originator need not make this disclosure
concerning a refinancing loan if the residential mortgage originator knows that the borrower's
existing loan that is anticipated to be refinanced does not have an escrow account. Compliance
with federal laws requiring disclosure of a periodic payment amount constitutes compliance with
this paragraph but only for purposes of the particular disclosure required under federal law;
    (25) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan, other than a reverse mortgage
pursuant to United States Code, title 15, chapter 41, if the borrower's compliance with any repayment
option offered pursuant to the terms of the loan will result in negative amortization during any
six-month period; or
    (26) make, provide, or arrange for a residential mortgage loan all or a portion of the proceeds
of which are used to fully or partially pay off a "special mortgage" unless the borrower has
obtained a written certification from a counselor with a third-party nonprofit or governmental
organization approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development or the
commissioner that the borrower has received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction.
The commissioner shall maintain a list of approved counseling programs. For purposes of this
section, "special mortgage" means a residential mortgage loan originated, subsidized, or guaranteed
by or through a state, tribal, or local government, or nonprofit organization, that bears one or more
of the following nonstandard payment terms which substantially benefit the borrower: (i) payments
vary with income; (ii) payments of principal or interest are not required or can be deferred under
specified conditions; (iii) principal or interest is forgivable under specified conditions; or (iv) where
no interest or an annual interest rate of two percent or less is charged in connection with the loan."

   Sec. 6. [53C.083] CONSUMER REPORT DISCLOSURE.
    (a) When a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency has been obtained for use in

have the meanings given in section 13C.001.
   Sec. 7. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325F.662, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8a. Certified motor vehicle. (a) It is unlawful for a dealer to advertise for sale or sell a
used motor vehicle as "certified" or use any similar descriptive term in the advertisement or the sale
of a used motor vehicle that implies the vehicle has been certified to meet the terms of a used motor
vehicle certification program if any of the following apply:
    (1) the dealer knows or should have known that the odometer on the vehicle does not indicate
actual mileage, has been rolled back or otherwise altered to show fewer miles, or has been replaced
with an odometer showing fewer miles than actually driven;
  (2) the dealer knows or should have known that the vehicle was reacquired by the vehicle's
manufacturer or a dealer pursuant to state or federal warranty laws;

"nonrepairable," "rebuilt," "reconditioned," "salvage," or similar title designation required by this
state or another state;
    (4) the dealer knows or should have known that the vehicle has sustained damage in an impact,
fire, or flood, that substantially impairs the use or safety of the vehicle;

   (b) This section does not abrogate or limit any disclosure obligation imposed by any other law.
   Sec. 8. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325F.662, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:
    Subd. 8b. Contract cancellation option. (a) A dealer shall not sell a used motor vehicle to a
consumer without granting the consumer a contract cancellation option that allows the consumer to
return the vehicle without cause and without cost, except for a restocking fee as permitted by this
subdivision. This subdivision does not apply to a used motor vehicle having a purchase price of
$40,000 or more.
    (b) The contract cancellation option must be contained in a document separate from the retail
installment contract or other vehicle purchase agreement and must contain, at a minimum, the

following:
   (1) the name of the dealer and the consumer;
   (2) a description and the vehicle identification number of the vehicle purchased;
    (3) a statement specifying the time within which the consumer must exercise the right to cancel
the purchase under the contract cancellation option and return the vehicle to the dealer. The dealer
shall not specify a time that is earlier than the dealer's close of business on the second day following
the day on which the vehicle was originally delivered to the consumer by the dealer;
    (4) a statement that clearly and conspicuously specifies the dollar amount of any restocking fee
the buyer must pay to the dealer to exercise the right to cancel the purchase under the contract
cancellation option. The restocking fee must not exceed $125 if the vehicle's cash price is $10,000
or less, $250 if the vehicle's cash price is less than $15,000 but greater than $10,000, $375 if the
vehicle's cash price is less than $20,000 but greater than or equal to $15,000, and $500 if the vehicle's
cash price is $20,000 or greater;
    (5) a statement specifying the maximum number of miles that the vehicle may be driven after its
original delivery by the dealer to the consumer to remain eligible for cancellation under the contract
cancellation option. A dealer shall not specify fewer than 250 miles in the contract cancellation
option;
    (6) a statement that the contract cancellation option gives the consumer the right to cancel the
purchase and obtain a full refund; and that the right to cancel will apply only if, within the time
specified in the contract cancellation option, the following are personally delivered to the dealer by
the consumer:
   (i) a written notice exercising the right to cancel the purchase signed by the consumer;
   (ii) any restocking fee specified in the contract cancellation option;
   (iii) the original contract cancellation option document and vehicle purchase contract and related
documents, if the dealer gave those original documents to the consumer;
   (iv) all original vehicle titling and registration documents, if the dealer gave those original
documents to the consumer;
    (v) an amount in certified funds to reimburse the dealer for its payments on the buyer's behalf
to discharge a lien on a vehicle left by the buyer as a downpayment or trade-in. If the dealer has
sold or otherwise transferred title to the motor vehicle that was left as a downpayment or trade-in,
the reimbursement amount owed to the dealer is only the amount that the dealer's payment to the
lienholder exceeds the value of the vehicle as indicated on the sales contract or purchase order; and
    (vi) the vehicle, free of all liens and encumbrances other than any lien or encumbrance created
by or incident to the sales contract, any loan arranged by the dealer or any purchase money loan
obtained by the consumer from a third party, and in the same condition as when it was delivered
by the dealer to the consumer, reasonable wear and tear and any defect or mechanical problem that
manifests or becomes evident after delivery that was not caused by the buyer excepted, and which
must not have been driven beyond the mileage limit specified in the contract cancellation option.
The agreement may also provide that the consumer will execute documents reasonably necessary

to effectuate the cancellation and refund and as reasonably required to comply with applicable law;
and
    (7) at the bottom of the contract cancellation option document, a statement that may be signed by
the consumer to indicate the consumer's election to exercise the right to cancel the purchase under
the terms of the contract cancellation option, and the last date and time by which the option to cancel
may be exercised, followed by a line for the consumer's signature. A particular form of statement
is not required, but the following statement is sufficient: "By signing below, I elect to exercise my
right to cancel the purchase of the vehicle described in this agreement." The consumer's delivery
of the contract cancellation option document to the dealer with the consumer's signature following
this statement shall constitute sufficient written notice exercising the right to cancel the purchase.
The dealer shall provide the consumer with the statement required by this paragraph in duplicate to
enable the consumer to return the signed contract cancellation document and retain a copy of the
contract cancellation document.
   (c)(1) No later than the third day following the day on which the consumer exercises the right to
cancel the purchase in compliance with the contract cancellation option, the dealer shall cancel the
contract and provide the consumer with a full refund in person or by United States first class mail,
postage prepaid; and
    (2) the dealer shall return to the consumer, no later than three days after the consumer
exercises the right to cancel the purchase, any motor vehicle the consumer left with the dealer
as a downpayment or trade-in. If the dealer has sold or otherwise transferred title to the motor
vehicle that was left as a downpayment or trade-in, the full refund described in clause (1) shall be
the value of the motor vehicle left as a downpayment or trade-in, as stated in the sale contract or
purchase order less any amount paid by the dealer to a lienholder on the buyer's behalf. The dealer
shall provide the full refund in the form of cash, a negotiable instrument as defined in section
336.3-104, or draft conditioned on the verification of an instrument accepted by the dealer as part
of the buyer's down payment.
    (d) If the dealer received a portion of the purchase price by credit card, or other third-party payer
on the consumer's account, the dealer must refund that portion of the purchase price to the credit
card issuer or third-party payer for credit to the consumer's account.
    (e) If the dealer received a portion of the purchase price by check or other negotiable instrument
as defined in section 336.3-104, the dealer need not return the amount of the payment until after the
check or negotiable instrument is finally paid as provided in section 336.4-213.
    (f) A dealer whose cancellation offer exceeds the requirements contained in subdivision 8b,
and whose cancellation offer in the contract of sale provides a purchase cancellation agreement
disclosing the terms of that cancellation offer shall be deemed to have complied with this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a dealer is not required to grant a contract cancellation option
to an individual who exercised the individual's right to cancel the purchase of a vehicle from the
dealer pursuant to a contract cancellation option during the immediately preceding 30 days or to an
individual that has exercised a purchase option on a vehicle the individual has previously leased. A
dealer is not required to give notice to a subsequent consumer of the return of a vehicle under this
section. This subdivision does not abrogate or limit any disclosure obligation imposed by any other
law.

    (h) This subdivision does not affect or alter the legal rights, duties, obligations, or liabilities
of the consumer, the dealer, or the dealer's agents or assigns, that would exist in the absence of a
contract cancellation option. Notwithstanding the existence of a contract cancellation option and the
fact that the dealer may retain title to the vehicle, the consumer is deemed the owner of the vehicle
for purposes of sections 65B.41 to 65B.71, and 169.09, subdivision 5a, when the consumer takes
delivery until the vehicle is returned pursuant to a contract cancellation option.
   Sec. 9. Minnesota Statutes 2006, section 325F.662, subdivision 10, is amended to read:
   Subd. 10. Limitation on actions. A private civil action brought by a consumer under this section
with respect to a warranty claim must be commenced within one year of the expiration of the express
warranty.

   (1) for any partial prepayment of the residential mortgage loan; or
    (2) for any prepayment of the residential mortgage loan upon the sale of any residential real
property, or the sale of any stock, interest, or lease relating to cooperative ownership of residential
real property, securing the loan; or
  (3) for any prepayment of the residential mortgage loan if the prepayment is made more than 42

borrowers located in this state with prepayment penalties, fees, premiums, or other charges
exceeding the maximum amount under paragraph (a), clause (4), then the residential mortgage
originator shall provide the following disclosure to each prospective borrower located in this state

the prospective borrower requests a residential mortgage loan, and again within three days before
the borrower signs the note or other agreement for the residential mortgage loan. The residential
mortgage originator also shall provide the disclosure to the prospective borrower in writing so that
it is received by the prospective borrower within five days after the residential mortgage originator

days before the prospective borrower signs the note or other agreement for the residential mortgage
loan. The written disclosure must be stated in at least 16-point capitalized boldface type on a single

provided, the name, address, and telephone number of the residential mortgage originator, the name

provisions of the disclosure form, other than the disclosure in this subdivision, are not required to be
in at least 16-point capitalized boldface type. The prospective borrower shall be permitted to keep
a copy of each written disclosure form. When a prospective borrower asks a residential mortgage
originator for information about a prepayment penalty, the residential mortgage originator shall give
the prospective borrower the requested information, and shall tell the borrower the highest aggregate
amount of the prepayment penalties, fees, premiums, and other charges that the residential mortgage
originator would charge to the prospective borrower for prepayment of the residential mortgage
loan one year after it is funded, based on a hypothetical unpaid principal balance of $100,000 and
also based on the highest interest rate that the residential mortgage originator would charge to the
prospective borrower. A mortgage originator responding to requests for residential mortgage loans
via the Internet may make the disclosure in a manner acceptable to the commissioner.

requiring or permitting the imposition of a penalty, fee, premium, or other charge in the event the

    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a scrap metal dealer may not disclose personal
information concerning a customer without the customer's consent unless the disclosure is made
in response to a request from a law enforcement agency. For purposes of this paragraph, "personal
information" is any individually identifiable information gathered in connection with a record under
paragraph (a). Data collected by a law enforcement agency under this paragraph are private data on
individuals to the extent that it would reveal the identity of persons who are customers of a scrap
metal dealer, and public data to the extent that it describes property in a regulated transaction with
a scrap metal dealer.
